These reports are found in the bookHistory of Muhammadby Sheikh Abdulla Saleh Farsy, p. 16, paragraph 4, which explains that Muhammad went to the cave of Hira at the age of 38, and in the second year of his stay there he experienced that incident.It is explained that one day in the month of Ramadan, when he encountered an unknown person, he was told, “Read,” but he replied that he did not know how to read. After this command was repeated several times and he was pressed, he was recited the opening words of Surah 96 (Iqra). After this incident, that person disappeared, and Muhammad returned home in great fear.Sheikh Abdulla Saleh Farsy further explains inThe Great Prophets and Their Followers, p. 12 paragraph 3, that when Muhammad returned home he developed a severe fever, trembled, and feared that he had gone mad or was being played with by demons. He told his wife Khadija about his fear, but Khadija comforted him and declared him to be a prophet because of his good character.According to these arguments, it is claimed that Muhammad received his prophethood while in a state of fever and fear, and that he himself feared that the one who confronted him was Satan. Even some narrations, as found inFat’hul Baary(p. 6, Hadith No. 89), narrate that Muhammad had a devil from the time of his birth.After that, belief spread that the one who came to him in the cave was the Angel Jibril, a matter that has been accepted in Islam to this day, although these arguments claim that this narrative came later to cover up the real origin of that incident.MUHAMMAD DIED OF FEVERRegarding the death of Muhammad, there are differing claims within Islam: some say he was poisoned, but Sheikh Abdulla Saleh Farsy writes inThe Life of the Prophet Muhammad(p. 79 paragraph 4) that Muhammad died of fever. He explains that he began to suffer from fever and headaches that increased day by day, until he became very weak.As the illness worsened, he requested permission from his wives to be nursed in the house of Aisha, where he continued to be ill until he died. Pages 80–81 explain how his condition continued to deteriorate until he died and was buried.The argument continues to claim that receiving prophethood through fever and dying of fever is a punishment from God, according to the Book of Deuteronomy 28:22, which mentions fever as a punishment for those who go against the laws of God.Furthermore, it is stated that Muhammad attempted to turn fever into a “blessing” by saying that fever erases sins, as quoted inThe Book of the Truthful and Trustworthy, Volumes 3–4, Hadith No. 922. This argument criticizes that view by claiming that it misleads believers into treating sin lightly.",

    "full_content": "Exposing the Theological Problem of Islam: Prayer, Language, and the Absence of Divine NearnessBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteA serious theological examination of Islam reveals a fundamental problem at its very core: the distance it creates between God and humanity. While Islam claims to be a universal faith, its structure exposes a system that is neither relational nor universally accessible. After reciting theShahada, a convert does not enter into an immediate relationship with God; instead, he enters a complex religious system that demands ritual conformity, linguistic submission, and mechanical repetition—most notably, prayer that is valid only in Arabic.This requirement alone exposes a critical contradiction. If God is truly the Creator of all nations and languages, why must communication with Him be restricted to a single human language? The reality faced by countless converts is telling: before they can meaningfully pray, they must memorize Arabic phrases they often do not understand, follow rigid bodily movements, and depend on written guides. Prayer becomes an exercise in performance rather than communion. This is not divine intimacy; it is ritual control.The theological implication is unmistakable: Islam prioritizes form over relationship. God is approached through a regulated system rather than through personal access. The believer is not invited to cry out spontaneously in fear, grief, or desperation, but is bound to prescribed times, words, and postures. A god who cannot be approached freely, in one’s own language, at any moment, reveals not divine closeness—but divine remoteness.Christian theology stands in direct opposition to this framework. In Christianity, prayer is not learned—it is lived. Believers pray directly to Jesus Christ, not through ritual formulas, sacred languages, or written scripts. Because Jesus is confessed as the eternal Creator and Lord of all nations, He understands every language and hears every voice. Whether whispered in danger, spoken in grief, or cried out in desperation, prayer is immediate and unmediated.This contrast exposes Islam not merely as a different faith, but as a fundamentally human-constructed religious system—one that depends on regulation, memorization, and linguistic uniformity to function. Christianity, by contrast, proclaims divine initiative: God comes to humanity, not humanity struggling upward through ritual systems. The incarnation of Christ dismantles religious barriers and replaces them with relationship.To be clear, this critique is not directed at individual Muslims, many of whom practice their faith with sincerity and devotion. Rather, it is a direct exposure of Islam’s theological architecture. A religion that restricts prayer to a single language, confines access to God within rigid procedures, and substitutes ritual precision for relational intimacy cannot credibly claim to bring humanity into genuine fellowship with the living God.Christianity proclaims something radically different: a God who is near, a Savior who listens, and a relationship that requires no sacred language, no ritual script, and no human system. This is not religion—it is revelation.—Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

    "full_content": "Age, Authority, and Consistency in Early Islamic Marriage Narratives: A Critical ExaminationDr. Maxwell ShimbaEarly Islamic historiography preserves multiple narratives concerning marriage practices associated with Muhammad, some of which have become central to contemporary scholarly and ethical debate. Among these are reports concerning the refusal of marriage proposals for his daughter, Fatimah, and parallel traditions describing his marriage to Aisha. When examined comparatively, these accounts raise questions about age, social norms, and interpretive consistency within early Islamic sources.According to widely cited narrations found inSunan an-Nasa’i, prominent companions such as Abu Bakr and Umar ibn al-Khattab proposed marriage to Fatimah. These proposals were reportedly declined on the grounds that she was “too young,” after which she later married Ali ibn Abi Talib. Classical commentators have generally interpreted this response as reflecting concerns related to age suitability, readiness, or compatibility within prevailing social norms.In contrast, the most authoritative Sunni hadith collections—Sahih al-BukhariandSahih Muslim—contain narrations attributing to Aisha an age of six at the time of her marriage contract and nine at consummation. These reports have been widely accepted within traditional Islamic scholarship and have informed legal discussions on marriage and consent across centuries of jurisprudence.The juxtaposition of these two narratives presents a methodological challenge. If youth constituted sufficient grounds to delay or decline Fatimah’s marriage, the attribution of a significantly younger age to Aisha raises questions regarding internal coherence in the application of marital standards. Classical scholars addressed this tension by appealing to contextual distinctions, including tribal customs, legal definitions of maturity, and the unique prophetic status of Muhammad. Modern scholars, however, increasingly interrogate the historical transmission of these reports, noting that hadith literature was compiled generations after the events described and that chronological precision was not always a primary concern of early transmitters.Revisionist approaches have sought to reassess Aisha’s age through comparative chronology—examining her participation in early Islamic events, her relationship to her sister Asma’, and timelines surrounding the migration (Hijra). While such reconstructions remain contested, they illustrate the diversity of scholarly engagement with the sources and underscore the non-monolithic nature of Islamic historiography.From an academic perspective, the significance of these narratives lies not merely in apologetic defense or polemical critique, but in rigorous historical analysis. Sacred history, like all history, is mediated through human agents, cultural assumptions, and textual transmission. A critical reading of early Islamic marriage accounts therefore requires attentiveness to source criticism, socio-historical context, and the limits of retrospective moral evaluation.In conclusion, the contrasting accounts concerning Fatimah and Aisha should be approached as part of a broader historiographical inquiry rather than isolated proof-texts. They invite scholars to examine how authority, normativity, and memory function within early Islamic tradition, and they demonstrate the necessity of maintaining analytical rigor when navigating sensitive intersections of faith, history, and ethics.References & BibliographyPrimary SourcesSahih al-Bukhari, Kitab al-NikahSahih Muslim, Kitab al-NikahSunan an-Nasa’i, Hadith on marriage proposals to FatimahIbn Sa‘d,Kitab al-Tabaqat al-KabirSecondary ScholarshipJonathan A.C.

    "full_content": "Shimba Theological Institute – Academic BlogA Critical Theological Examination of Muhammad’s Marital History and the Question of Moral ExemplarshipIntroductionWithin Islamic theology,Muhammadis presented asal-insān al-kāmil—the perfect human and universal moral exemplar (uswa hasana; Qur’an 33:21). This claim invites serious theological scrutiny, particularly when moral norms are taught as timeless and binding. This article examines Muhammad’s marital history as preserved in classical Islamic sources and evaluates whether these narratives coherently support the assertion of universal moral exemplarity when compared with biblical prophetic ethics.1. Marriage toKhadijah: Patronage and PowerIslamic tradition records that Muhammad married Khadijah, a wealthy widow significantly older than himself, early in his adult life. While Muslim scholarship often emphasizes mutual affection and loyalty, the material realities are also evident: Khadijah’s commercial resources and social standing provided financial stability and protection during Muhammad’s formative years. Theologically, this raises questions about power dynamics and whether prophetic legitimacy should be insulated from economic dependency.2. Post-Khadijah Marriages: Expansion of PrivilegeAfter Khadijah’s death, Muhammad entered multiple marriages that marked a decisive shift in pattern and scale. The marriage toSawda bint Zam'a, an older widow, is commonly explained as charitable. However, subsequent unions increasingly coincided with political consolidation and personal privilege, suggesting a transition from domestic stability to expansive marital authority.3.Aishaand the Problem of NormativityClassical Sunni hadith literature reports that Aisha was betrothed at a very young age and that the marriage was consummated while she was still a child by modern standards. While apologists argue historical contextualization, the issue remains theological rather than merely historical: can conduct defended as “of its time” function as atimelessmoral model for all societies? A universal exemplar must transcend context, not be excused by it.4.Zaynab bint Jahshand Revelation Aligned with DesireMuhammad’s marriage to Zaynab, formerly the wife of his adopted son, followed a Qur’anic revelation that redefined adoption laws (Qur’an 33:37). Critics note the ethical tension created when divine legislation appears to resolve a personal desire. This episode raises a foundational theological concern: should revelation serve moral constraint—or personal accommodation?5. Captivity, Concubinage, and ConsentIslamic sources also record relationships with women taken as captives of war, includingSafiyya bint HuyayyandMaria the Copt. These narratives present acute ethical problems regarding consent, coercion, and the moral implications of sexual access following military conquest. The normalization of such practices challenges claims of moral universality.6. Comparative Prophetic Ethics in the BibleWhen compared with biblical figures—such asNoah,Abraham,Moses,David, and supremelyJesus Christ—a marked ethical contrast emerges. While the Bible does not conceal the moral failures of its characters, it does not elevate those failures as normative. Jesus, in particular, embodies moral perfection without sexual privilege, coercion, or marital accumulation, reinforcing a standard grounded in self-giving love rather than entitlement.7. The “Historical Context” Defense ReconsideredThe frequent claim that Muhammad’s actions were “normal for the time” undermines the assertion of timeless moral guidance. If prophetic conduct is context-bound, then its authority cannot be absolute. A true moral exemplar must challenge the ethics of his age, not merely reflect or benefit from them.ConclusionFrom a Christian theological perspective, Muhammad’s marital history—when evaluated through Islamic primary sources—presents serious difficulties for the doctrine of universal moral exemplarity. The alignment of revelation with personal interest, the normalization of child marriage and concubinage, and the expansion of sexual privilege through power stand in tension with the biblical vision of holiness and moral transcendence. Shimba Theological Institute maintains that moral authority must be consistent, self-sacrificial, and universally defensible—criteria fulfilled not by contextual justification, but by ethical coherence across time.— Shimba Theological Institute",

    "full_content": "Shimba Theological InstituteNewsletter ArticleCucumbers, Bananas, and the Crisis of Gendered Morality in IslamThe recent phenomenon of clerical fatwas warning Muslim women against cucumbers and bananas has become a case study in how fragile moral reasoning can collapse into comedy. According to some voices within Islamic jurisprudence, women must not touch, consume, or even gaze too long at these fruits, lest they awaken sinful desire. By such logic, the grocery store becomes a battlefield of cosmic temptation, and the vegetable aisle a theater of spiritual war.This prohibition, however, does not exist in a vacuum. It reveals a broader pattern within Islamic legal thought, where women are continually burdened with the weight of communal morality while men enjoy a far wider margin of permissibility. Masturbation is forbidden, sex toys are condemned, and female pleasure is treated as radioactive. Yet, disturbingly, male indulgence—including shocking allowances toward bestiality in some classical texts—is glossed over with astonishing leniency. Thus, the woman’s cucumber is a crisis, but the man’s goat is a footnote.From a theological perspective, such asymmetry exposes the collapse of a coherent anthropology. If creation is truly from God, then cucumbers and bananas are no more agents of temptation than rivers or stars. To fear fruit more than falsehood is not holiness but hysteria. What these fatwas betray is not divine command but clerical anxiety—an inability to grapple with female embodiment without resorting to absurd restrictions. The result is a moral universe where vegetables are policed, women are blamed, and men host what can only be described as a goat circus in broad daylight.Christian theology, by contrast, offers a liberating corrective. In Scripture, the body is good (Genesis 1:31), sexuality is holy within covenant (Hebrews 13:4), and moral responsibility is shared equally by men and women (Galatians 3:28). Unlike the fear-driven prohibitions of cucumbers and bananas, the biblical witness insists that sin is rooted in the human heart, not in the produce aisle. When morality is reduced to slicing fruit into “halal-safe” pieces, one must ask: has divine law been eclipsed by comedy?Conclusion:The cucumber-ban fatwas may provoke laughter, but beneath the satire lies a tragedy—the reduction of women’s dignity to a paranoid obsession with vegetables. If morality is to have integrity, it cannot fear fruit more than injustice, nor cucumbers more than corruption. True holiness demands not cucumber policing but the recovery of divine justice, equality, and embodied dignity for both men and women.—Shimba Theological InstituteShimba Theological InstituteNewsletter SeriesFruit, Gender, and Morality in Islam: A Theological and Cultural InquiryPart I: The Vegetable Fatwas — A Genealogy of Cucumber and Banana ProhibitionsByShimba Theological InstituteIntroductionIn recent years, a number of highly publicized clerical pronouncements from parts of the Islamic world have warned Muslim women against handling, consuming, or even gazing too long at objects such as cucumbers and bananas. These statements—often justified as preventive measures against sexual temptation—have circulated widely through news outlets and social media, provoking both laughter and concern. While easily dismissed as fringe or anecdotal, these “vegetable fatwas” deserve serious scholarly attention, for they reveal a deeper theological and cultural logic governing gender, sexuality, and moral responsibility in certain Islamic contexts.Historical and Juridical BackgroundIslamic jurisprudence (fiqh) is traditionally grounded in the Qur’an, the Hadith, consensus (ijmāʿ), and analogical reasoning (qiyās). Within this framework, moral rulings have historically addressed concrete behaviors—acts of worship, commercial transactions, marriage, and criminal offenses. However, the emergence of prohibitions centered on neutral objects such as fruits represents a departure from classical legal reasoning into what may be described as symbolic moral panic.The cucumber and banana warnings do not stem directly from canonical texts. Rather, they arise from extrapolations rooted in the belief that women’s sexual imagination must be tightly regulated to preserve social order. In this logic, resemblance becomes danger: an object vaguely suggestive of male anatomy is treated not as food but as a moral hazard. The legal issue is no longer behavior but perception—what a woman might think rather than what she does.Gendered Moral AnxietyThese fatwas are best understood as part of a broader pattern in which female sexuality is framed as inherently volatile and in constant need of external control. The moral burden is placed almost entirely upon women, whose bodies and thoughts are treated as sites of perpetual risk. Men, by contrast, are rarely subjected to comparable scrutiny regarding their everyday interactions with objects, animals, or environments.This asymmetry reveals a fundamental theological imbalance. When cucumbers become suspect, it is not because the object has moral agency but because the female subject is presumed incapable of moral self-regulation. The result is a system in which women are disciplined not for actions but for potential desires, while men are granted implicit trust—or at least tolerated latitude—in their moral failures.The Logic of Preventive SinThe vegetable fatwas also illustrate a preventive approach to sin that borders on the absurd. Rather than addressing lust as a matter of inner discipline, character formation, or ethical responsibility, sin is externalized and projected onto objects. This logic implies that holiness is achieved not through virtue but through avoidance of shapes, symbols, and stimuli.Such reasoning ultimately undermines moral accountability. If sin originates in cucumbers, then the human heart is exonerated. The theological consequence is a displacement of responsibility away from moral agents and toward inanimate items. This inversion of ethics transforms religion into a parody of itself, where slicing fruit appears safer than cultivating virtue.Implications for Theology and SocietyThe public ridicule of these fatwas should not obscure their real social cost. When women are taught that even food is dangerous, fear becomes a governing principle of religious life. Anxiety replaces conscience, and surveillance replaces spiritual growth. Moreover, these rulings reinforce patriarchal hierarchies by institutionalizing suspicion of women’s bodies while normalizing male privilege.From a comparative theological perspective, such developments stand in stark contrast to traditions that locate sin within the will and conscience rather than in vegetables. Any religious system that fears bananas more than injustice risks forfeiting its moral credibility.ConclusionThe cucumber and banana prohibitions are not merely curiosities; they are symptoms of a deeper crisis in gendered moral theology. By elevating symbolic fear over ethical substance, these rulings expose the fragility of a system unable to articulate a balanced doctrine of desire, responsibility, and human dignity. In the next installment, we will examine how these anxieties manifest in broader double standards within Islamic sexual ethics—and why women consistently bear the heavier burden.—Shimba Theological InstituteShimba Theological InstituteNewsletter SeriesFruit, Gender, and Morality in Islam: A Theological and Cultural InquiryPart II: Gendered Double Standards in Islamic Sexual EthicsByShimba Theological InstituteIntroductionHaving examined the emergence of so-called “vegetable fatwas” in Part I, we now turn to the broader ethical framework that makes such rulings plausible. The prohibition of cucumbers and bananas is not an isolated anomaly but a logical outgrowth of a deeply gendered system of sexual ethics. At its core lies a striking asymmetry: women are subjected to intensive moral surveillance, while men are afforded disproportionate latitude. This imbalance is not incidental; it is structural, theological, and historically entrenched.Female Desire as a Moral ThreatWithin many strands of Islamic moral discourse, female sexuality is framed not as morally neutral or divinely ordered but as inherently destabilizing. A woman’s desire is portrayed as a force capable of unraveling families, communities, and even faith itself. Consequently, an elaborate architecture of prohibitions emerges—restrictions on movement, dress, speech, imagination, and now even food. Masturbation is condemned, sexual self-knowledge is stigmatized, and pleasure outside narrow marital parameters is treated as a spiritual contaminant.What is noteworthy is not merely the existence of moral limits but their one-sided application. Women are trained to internalize guilt for thoughts they have not acted upon, while responsibility for male desire is displaced onto female presence. The theological message is clear: women are dangerous, men are weak, and therefore women must be controlled.Male Latitude and Juridical LeniencyIn sharp contrast, classical Islamic jurisprudence exhibits notable flexibility when addressing male sexual conduct. Historical legal manuals discuss concubinage, polygyny, temporary marriage (mutʿain Shiʿi contexts), and even troubling discussions surrounding sexual acts involving animals. While not universally endorsed, such topics are often treated with technical detachment rather than moral outrage. The issue becomes one of classification rather than condemnation.This disparity reveals a moral calculus in which male transgression is manageable, contextual, or excusable, while female desire is catastrophic. A man’s act may be a legal irregularity; a woman’s thought becomes a cosmic threat. Thus, the woman holding a cucumber is scrutinized more severely than the man engaging in overtly exploitative behavior.Theological IncoherenceFrom a systematic theological perspective, this asymmetry is deeply incoherent. If God is just, moral responsibility must be proportionate and universal. Yet in this framework, men are treated as morally autonomous agents, while women are reduced to sources of temptation requiring external restraint. Such logic collapses under scrutiny: either desire is sinful for all, or it is morally neutral until acted upon. One cannot consistently criminalize female imagination while excusing male action.Moreover, this imbalance undermines the very notion of accountability. When men are not held equally responsible for their sexual conduct, sin is trivialized. When women are punished preemptively, justice is abandoned. What remains is not divine law but patriarchal convenience sanctified by religious language.Social and Psychological ConsequencesThe lived consequences of these double standards are profound. Women raised under constant suspicion often internalize shame toward their bodies, experience anxiety around normal biological processes, and struggle with spiritual identity. Men, meanwhile, may develop a diminished sense of moral responsibility, learning that desire is natural for them but sinful in women. The result is a society fractured by mistrust, repression, and hypocrisy.Ironically, the obsessive regulation of women does not produce moral purity; it produces fixation. By sexualizing everything—from hair to fruit—religious authorities inadvertently eroticize the very objects they seek to neutralize. Thus, cucumbers become scandalous not by nature but by theology.Comparative ReflectionIn contrast, biblical anthropology assigns moral agency equally. Scripture locates sin in the heart and will, not in gender or objects (Jeremiah 17:9; Matthew 15:18–19). Both men and women are called to holiness, self-control, and accountability. Desire is acknowledged, disciplined, and redeemed—not feared into absurdity. Where Islamic double standards fracture moral coherence, the biblical framework preserves ethical symmetry.ConclusionThe gendered double standards embedded within Islamic sexual ethics form the soil from which vegetable fatwas naturally grow. When women are treated as moral liabilities and men as moral exceptions, cucumbers become threats and justice becomes negotiable. In the next installment, we will explore how this logic extends beyond sexuality to everyday objects—clothing, perfume, and public space—revealing a theology increasingly governed by fear rather than truth.—Shimba Theological InstituteShimba Theological InstituteNewsletter SeriesFruit, Gender, and Morality in Islam: A Theological and Cultural InquiryPart III: Objects of Fear — From Fruit to FashionByShimba Theological InstituteIntroductionHaving traced the emergence of vegetable-related prohibitions (Part I) and the gendered double standards that sustain them (Part II), this installment broadens the lens. The anxiety that renders cucumbers and bananas morally suspect does not stop at food. It extends into clothing, cosmetics, fragrance, voice, and public presence. Together, these restrictions form an object-centered moral regime in which women’s everyday environments are transformed into potential sources of sin.From Bodies to Objects: The Expansion of Moral SuspicionIn many Islamic contexts influenced by strict legalism, the regulation of female sexuality migrates outward—from the body to the objects associated with it. Hair becomes provocative, perfume becomes seductive, clothing becomes culpable, and accessories become suspicious. The logic is cumulative: if desire is dangerous, and women are presumed to provoke desire, then anything connected to women must be monitored.This process explains how neutral items—makeup, shoes, handbags, and even vegetables—acquire moral weight. The object is no longer neutral; it becomes a symbolic extension of female sexuality. Thus, morality is no longer about ethical intention or conduct but about managing symbols and appearances.Clothing, Modesty, and the Slippery Slope of ControlDebates about modest dress illustrate how quickly reasonable ethical concerns slide into excessive regulation. While many religious traditions encourage modesty, the transformation of modesty into compulsion marks a decisive shift. Once enforced externally, modesty ceases to be virtue and becomes surveillance.In such systems, women are held responsible not only for their own conduct but for the imagined reactions of men. A woman’s clothing is treated as causative of male desire, effectively absolving men of moral agency. The same reasoning that fears uncovered hair or fitted clothing also fears bananas and cucumbers: both are said to “trigger” immoral thoughts. The common denominator is not the object but the presumption that men cannot be held accountable for their responses.Perfume, Voice, and the Criminalization of PresenceThe fear of objects extends beyond sight to sound and scent. In some interpretations, women are discouraged or forbidden from wearing perfume in public, speaking audibly, or laughing openly. The female presence itself becomes eroticized, and everyday human expression is recast as provocation.This reveals a paradox: the more authorities attempt to desexualize society through restriction, the more they sexualize women’s existence. When fragrance is treated as seduction and speech as temptation, the problem is no longer morality but obsession.Anthropological Perspectives on TabooAnthropologists have long observed that societies under stress often construct taboos around ordinary objects. Mary Douglas famously argued that impurity systems arise where boundaries feel threatened. In this light, fruit bans and fashion controls reflect a culture anxious about maintaining patriarchal order. By policing objects, authorities symbolically reassert control over bodies they fear they cannot govern directly.Thus, cucumbers and clothing are not the cause of moral concern but its symptom. They serve as proxies for unresolved anxieties about gender, power, and desire.Theological ConsequencesFrom a theological standpoint, object-based morality represents a serious departure from ethical coherence. When sin is externalized, virtue becomes performative. Righteousness is measured by compliance with visible rules rather than transformation of character. This shift empties morality of its spiritual substance and replaces it with ritualized fear.A theology that cannot trust women with clothing or fruit ultimately reveals its inability to articulate a robust doctrine of the human person. Instead of affirming dignity, it cultivates suspicion; instead of forming conscience, it enforces compliance.Comparative ReflectionBiblical theology offers a stark contrast. While Scripture acknowledges the importance of modesty and self-control, it consistently locates sin within the heart and will, not in objects (Mark 7:15). Clothing, food, and fragrance are morally neutral; what matters is love, justice, and responsibility. The escalation from fruit to fashion seen in certain Islamic contexts highlights the danger of confusing symbols with substance.ConclusionThe fear of cucumbers is inseparable from the fear of clothing, perfume, and female presence itself. Together, they form a system in which objects are moralized to compensate for a lack of ethical symmetry. In the next installment, we will step back and compare these dynamics with broader theological traditions, examining how different faiths understand the body, desire, and human dignity.—Shimba Theological InstituteShimba Theological InstituteNewsletter SeriesFruit, Gender, and Morality in Islam: A Theological and Cultural InquiryPart IV: Comparative Theologies of the BodyByShimba Theological InstituteIntroductionIn the preceding installments, we examined the peculiar case of vegetable fatwas (Part I), the gendered double standards of Islamic sexual ethics (Part II), and the moralization of everyday objects (Part III). Having established the context and consequences of these practices, it is now necessary to consider them within a comparative theological framework. How does the Islamic treatment of the body, desire, and moral responsibility compare with other religious traditions, particularly biblical and Christian thought?The Body as Good: Biblical AnthropologyIn biblical theology, the human body is inherently good, created in the image of God (Genesis 1:26–31). This foundational assertion carries profound implications for ethics, sexuality, and human dignity. Desire is acknowledged as part of the created order, not inherently corrupt or dangerous. The moral focus is not on the body itself, nor on the objects surrounding it, but on the intentions and actions of the heart (Jeremiah 17:9; Matthew 15:18–20).Sexuality, within this framework, is sanctified when exercised according to covenantal principles, especially within marriage (Hebrews 13:4). Both men and women are called to cultivate self-control, mutual respect, and holiness. Unlike the object-centered anxieties explored in Parts I–III, sin is not projected onto neutral items such as fruit or clothing but addressed as a matter of character formation and relational ethics.Desire, Accountability, and Moral SymmetryA critical feature of the biblical approach is its gender symmetry. Men and women share equal moral responsibility for actions, desires, and intentions (Galatians 3:28). There is no theological justification for assigning danger or culpability based solely on gender. Unlike the disproportionate scrutiny placed on women in certain Islamic contexts, the biblical framework emphasizes accountability, virtue, and spiritual formation as universal requirements.This symmetry contrasts sharply with prohibitions that cast cucumbers and bananas as moral hazards while overlooking male indulgence. The biblical perspective affirms that morality is grounded in the ethical and spiritual condition of the individual, rather than in external symbols or gendered vulnerabilities.Moralizing Objects versus Cultivating VirtueThe Islamic emphasis on controlling objects—vegetables, clothing, or perfumes—as a proxy for controlling morality represents a significant divergence from biblical teaching. In biblical thought, external items are morally neutral; ethical life is a matter of internal cultivation. Proverbs 4:23 advises, “Above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it.” The emphasis is on interior transformation, not external surveillance.By contrast, object-centered prohibitions risk producing performative compliance, fear-driven behavior, and distorted understandings of virtue. When cucumbers are feared and clothing is surveilled, moral formation becomes anxiety management rather than conscience development.Theological Implications for Gender and DignityThe comparative analysis illuminates deeper consequences for gender justice. In object-based moral systems, women bear a disproportionate burden, and moral authority is exercised in ways that reinforce patriarchal control. By acknowledging the body as good and desire as morally manageable, biblical theology provides a framework for dignity, equity, and moral responsibility.The contrast also highlights the potential for theological critique within interfaith dialogue. While respecting religious traditions, one may question practices that systemically constrain women’s agency, distort moral reasoning, and equate inanimate objects with sin.ConclusionComparing Islamic object-based moral anxieties with biblical anthropology demonstrates a profound divergence in understanding the body, desire, and human responsibility. Where certain Islamic practices externalize sin onto objects and disproportionately burden women, biblical theology locates morality within the heart, applies it universally, and affirms the inherent goodness of creation.In the next installment,Part V: Satire as Theological Critique, we will explore how humor and irony can serve as legitimate tools for exposing moral absurdities and prompting reflective theological discourse.—Shimba Theological InstituteShimba Theological InstituteNewsletter SeriesFruit, Gender, and Morality in Islam: A Theological and Cultural InquiryPart V: Satire as Theological CritiqueByShimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThe previous installments have traced the emergence of vegetable fatwas, gendered double standards, and the moralization of everyday objects, and compared these practices with biblical anthropology. In this installment, we turn to the role ofsatireas a tool for theological critique. While laughter may seem frivolous in the context of serious moral and religious issues, humor has historically been a powerful instrument for exposing hypocrisy, absurdity, and imbalance in human institutions.Humor as a Mirror of AbsurdityThe cucumber and banana prohibitions, when framed in their full context, border on the absurd. A woman forbidden from touching a cucumber for fear of immoral thought highlights a disjunction between theology and lived reality. Satire allows scholars and religious critics to illuminate such disjunctions without descending into polemical attacks. By exaggerating or highlighting the illogic of certain rulings, satire reveals the underlying social and theological anxieties that produce them.Historically, satire has been a recognized tool for moral correction. From the classical Greek playwrights to medieval Christian polemicists, humor has been employed to reveal inconsistency, exaggeration, and injustice in societal norms. In a religious context, satire functions as a mirror, reflecting the contradictions between professed values and enacted practice.Satire and Theological ReflectionUsing satire in theological critique requires discernment. The goal is not ridicule for its own sake butilluminative critique—exposing where reasoning has collapsed under cultural or patriarchal pressures. In the case of gendered prohibitions around objects, satirical framing can underscore the disparity between moral theory and ethical substance.For example, framing a scenario where sliced cucumbers are sold as “halal-safe” reveals the incoherence of object-centered moral anxiety. The exaggeration draws attention to the real issue: the system’s inability to cultivate virtue and accountability, particularly among men, while imposing arbitrary restrictions on women.Satire as a Tool for Ethical EngagementBeyond critique, satire encourages engagement and dialogue. When done thoughtfully, it invites audiences—both religious and secular—to question assumptions, consider ethical implications, and reflect on the justice of gendered moral codes. By translating complex theological and ethical arguments into accessible, humorous scenarios, satire can bridge gaps between scholarly discourse and public understanding.In the context of the fatwas under discussion, satire functions asa method of advocacy for gender justice and moral clarity. It exposes the absurdity of policing vegetables while men remain largely unaccountable, opening space for reasoned debate about the alignment of theology, ethics, and human dignity.Limitations and ConsiderationsIt is important to acknowledge the limitations of satire. Humor can be misunderstood, dismissed as irreverent, or weaponized in ways that deepen divisions. Effective theological satire requires careful calibration: it must illuminate rather than attack, provoke reflection rather than deride the vulnerable, and maintain scholarly rigor while engaging imagination.ConclusionSatire, when applied judiciously, serves as a legitimate and potent tool in theological critique. In examining the absurdity of prohibitions around cucumbers, bananas, clothing, and perfume, it highlights systemic inequities, patriarchal anxieties, and the misalignment of moral reasoning with ethical responsibility.In the next installment,Part VI: Toward a Theology of Human Dignity, we will synthesize insights from the previous parts to construct a framework that emphasizes equality, justice, and the moral integrity of both men and women. This final installment will propose a vision for ethical formation that transcends fear-driven regulations and affirms human dignity as the foundation of morality.—Shimba Theological InstituteShimba Theological InstituteNewsletter SeriesFruit, Gender, and Morality in Islam: A Theological and Cultural InquiryPart VI: Toward a Theology of Human DignityByShimba Theological InstituteIntroductionIn the preceding installments, we have traced the evolution of vegetable-related fatwas, analyzed gendered double standards, explored the moralization of everyday objects, compared Islamic and biblical approaches to the body, and reflected on the role of satire in theological critique. In this final part, we synthesize these insights into a framework for atheology of human dignity, emphasizing equality, justice, and moral responsibility.Human Dignity as a Theological PrincipleCentral to any robust ethical system is the affirmation of human dignity. The biblical tradition, which has served as a comparative lens throughout this series, anchors this principle in the doctrine of theimago Dei: all humans are created in the image of God (Genesis 1:26–27). This doctrine affirms that dignity is intrinsic, universal, and not contingent upon gender, compliance with arbitrary prohibitions, or social status.By contrast, the object-centered moralism examined in prior parts—vegetables as moral hazards, clothing as provocations, perfume as seduction—reduces human beings, particularly women, to objects of suspicion. This inversion erodes dignity, replacing moral formation with fear-driven compliance.Equality and Moral AccountabilityA theology of dignity requires thatmoral responsibility be universal and proportionate. Men and women must be equally accountable for their actions, desires, and intentions. Sin is not inherent in a gendered body or projected onto neutral objects; it resides in the choices of the individual. This principle restores ethical symmetry absent in gendered fatwas, ensuring that moral systems cultivate virtue rather than perpetuate fear, shame, or inequality.Moreover, equality in moral accountability enables the development of conscience rather than external surveillance. When both men and women are encouraged to cultivate virtue internally, morality becomes a matter of character formation, not regulation of neutral stimuli.Reclaiming Desire and the BodyA theology of dignity affirms thegoodness of the body and the naturalness of desire. Desire is not inherently dangerous but must be integrated into ethical living. By acknowledging the body as created good (Genesis 1:31) and desire as morally neutral until ethically directed, this framework allows for holistic human development. Women are freed from the absurdities of object-based moral policing, while men are held accountable for responsible exercise of their desires.Transforming Social and Religious PracticeTheological principles of dignity, equality, and accountability must be translated into practice. Religious communities and legal systems should:Prioritize internal moral formationover external object policing.Ensure gender parity in moral expectationsand consequences.Reject fear-driven prohibitionsthat infantilize or sexualize neutral objects.Encourage ethical reflectiongrounded in conscience, relational integrity, and justice rather than ritualized surveillance.By implementing these practices, faith communities can foster moral maturity, mutual respect, and social justice, restoring coherence to ethics and honoring the divine image in all people.ConclusionThe theological and cultural inquiry undertaken in this series demonstrates that morality cannot be grounded in fear of objects, gendered surveillance, or patriarchal anxieties. True holiness and ethical integrity arise from recognizing theinherent dignity of all humans, cultivating virtue in the heart, and applying moral responsibility equally.A theology of human dignity transcends absurd prohibitions, reconciles desire with ethics, and affirms both men and women as moral agents. By centering ethics on human worth rather than vegetables, perfume, or clothing, faith communities can move toward a more just, compassionate, and coherent moral vision.—Shimba Theological Institute",

The Qur’an describes Muhammad’s wives as the“Mothers of the Believers”(Surah al-Ahzab 33:6), yet in the same chapter (33:40), it explicitly declares that Muhammad is“not the father of any of your men.”This raises critical theological, logical, and ethical questions about the nature of Muhammad’s paternal status in Islam and the prohibition against remarriage of his widows. This paper seeks to analyze this doctrinal inconsistency through historical, linguistic, and theological perspectives, and to question the coherence of the Qur’anic reasoning in relation to social and moral norms.1. IntroductionThe Qur’an presents Muhammad as both theMessenger of AllahandSeal of the Prophets(Qur’an 33:40). However, it simultaneously establishes a peculiar familial relationship between Muhammad and his followers. His wives are declared the“Mothers of the Believers”(33:6), while Muhammad himself is emphatically denied any paternal role toward his male followers. This duality gives rise to a complex paradox: how can one’s wives bemotherswhile the husband isnot a father?The contradiction becomes more pronounced in light of Islamic marital law, which forbids any man from marrying the Prophet’s widows, invoking their “maternal” status to the Muslim community. Yet, logically, if Muhammad is not a father to any believer, the justification for this prohibition becomes unclear.2. The Qur’anic Framework2.1. The Denial of Fatherhood (Qur’an 33:40)“Muḥammad is not the father of any of your men, but the Messenger of Allah and the Seal of the Prophets.”This verse was reportedly revealed in response to the controversy surrounding Zayd ibn Harithah, Muhammad’s adopted son. When Muhammad married Zayd’s former wife, Zaynab bint Jahsh, the Qur’an redefined adoption laws, annulling adopted sonship and, consequently, Muhammad’s legal fatherhood over Zayd (see Tafsir al-Tabari,Jami’ al-Bayan, vol. 22). Thus, the verse served to deny Muhammad any human fatherhood over the believers, preserving his prophetic status from personal familial association.2.2. The Declaration of Spiritual Maternity (Qur’an 33:6)“The Prophet is closer to the believers than their own selves, and his wives are their mothers.”This verse confers a unique symbolic status on Muhammad’s wives, elevating them above ordinary women. However, the text does not clarify the logical basis for this designation nor its theological implications, especially since it does not confer corresponding paternal authority upon Muhammad himself.3. The Logical InconsistencyThe two verses (33:6 and 33:40) produce a theological dilemma:If Muhammad’s wives aremothersof the believers, then Muhammad logically ought to be thefatherof the believers.If Muhammad isnot a fatherof any of the believers, then his wives cannot logically bemothersof the believers.Islamic apologists argue that “motherhood” in 33:6 is spiritual, not biological. Yet, the same principle could apply to Muhammad’s “fatherhood” — spiritual rather than physical. The deliberate exclusion of Muhammad’s paternal role seems inconsistent with the spiritual analogy intended by the verse.4. The Ethical Question: Prohibition of RemarriageAfter Muhammad’s death, the Qur’an prohibited his widows from remarrying (Qur’an 33:53):“And it is not lawful for you to harm the Messenger of Allah, nor to marry his wives after him ever. Indeed, that would be an enormity in the sight of Allah.”This restriction is justified by their “maternal” status — yet the argument collapses under scrutiny.If the Prophet’s wives were “mothers” only in a symbolic sense, why should they be denied remarriage — a right granted to all other widows in Islam (Qur’an 2:234–235)?Moreover, if Muhammad is not the “father” of the believers, then his widows cannot truly be “mothers” to them, and the prohibition becomes legally and ethically questionable.5. Historical Context: Muhammad’s MarriagesMuhammad’s marriages included several widows, such as Sawdah bint Zam’ah, Hafsah bint Umar, and Umm Salamah. These marriages were often justified as acts of social welfare. Yet the same compassion was not extended to his own widows, who were condemned to lifelong celibacy. The question arises: if Muhammad could marry widows for their protection, why could not others protect and marry his widows after his death?The inconsistency suggests that the prohibition was politically and socially motivated to preserve the Prophet’s exclusive legacy and to prevent disputes over lineage or inheritance within the early Muslim community.6. Theological ImplicationsFrom a theological standpoint, Islam presents Muhammad as the“Seal of the Prophets”— the final messenger and ultimate exemplar. Yet the Qur’an strips him of spiritual fatherhood, creating a vacuum in the believer’s personal relationship to him. Christianity, by contrast, recognizes both paternal and fraternal spiritual relationships in divine-human dynamics (cf. 1 Corinthians 4:15, Philippians 2:22).In Islam, however, Muhammad’s detachment as “not the father” while his wives remain “mothers” results in a doctrinal asymmetry — a partial metaphor that fails to maintain theological coherence.7. ConclusionThe Qur’an’s portrayal of Muhammad’s family relationships reveals a deep inconsistency within Islamic theology.If Muhammad is not the father of any believer, then his wives cannot logically be the believers’ mothers.If his wives are indeed the “Mothers of the Believers,” then a corresponding paternal role must exist — at least symbolically.The prohibition on the remarriage of Muhammad’s widows, coupled with his own marriages to other widows, further exposes the internal contradictions within Islamic social ethics.This paradox demonstrates that the Qur’anic narrative on Muhammad’s familial relations is less theological and more political — crafted to preserve Muhammad’s exclusive prophetic authority rather than to maintain logical or moral consistency.ReferencesThe Qur’an, Surah al-Ahzab (33:6, 33:40, 33:53).Al-Tabari,Jami’ al-Bayan fi Ta’wil al-Qur’an, Vol. 22.Ibn Kathir,Tafsir al-Qur’an al-‘Azim, commentary on Surah al-Ahzab.Al-Qurtubi,Al-Jami’ li-Ahkam al-Qur’an, commentary on 33:6 and 33:40.Sahih al-Bukhari, Hadith 4787 – Narration on Zayd ibn Harithah and Zaynab bint Jahsh.Watt, W.

    "full_content": "A Comprehensive Critical Examination of Muhammad’s ProphethoodAbstract:This study critically examines Muhammad’s claim to prophethood from historical, textual, and comparative perspectives. Despite his profound historical influence, the absence of verifiable miracles, reliance on posthumous textual sources, and sociopolitical entanglements challenge the authenticity of his prophetic claims. Using a framework derived from Abrahamic prophetic standards, this analysis evaluates Muhammad’s mission and invites scholarly debate regarding prophetic legitimacy.1. IntroductionMuhammad (c. 570–632 CE) is regarded by Muslims as the Seal of the Prophets, the final messenger through whom God completed the line of divine revelation. The Quran presents him as divinely inspired, while hadith literature records miracles, sayings, and historical narratives that constitute his prophetic biography. Muhammad’s life and mission are central to the formation of Islamic civilization and its theological foundations.However, the claim of divine prophethood must be subjected to critical scrutiny, particularly when evaluated against the criteria applied to prophetic figures in Abrahamic traditions. Historically, recognized prophets have demonstrated divine authority through observable miracles, fulfilled prophecies, and immediate validation by contemporaries. Muhammad’s reported miracles, textual compilation, and socio-political role raise questions about the veracity of his claims when assessed through historical-critical methods.This paper examines three primary dimensions: the historical context of 6th–7th century Arabia; textual and biographical evidence regarding Muhammad’s life and the Quran; and the absence of independently verifiable miracles. Comparative analysis with recognized prophetic standards in Judaism and Christianity provides a framework for assessing the legitimacy of Muhammad’s prophetic claims. The aim is to engage in rigorous academic evaluation, not to dismiss the cultural or historical influence of Muhammad.2. Historical Context of 6th–7th Century ArabiaUnderstanding Muhammad’s claims requires situating his life within the social, political, and religious landscape of pre-Islamic Arabia. The Arabian Peninsula was a mosaic of tribal communities with varying degrees of religious belief, trade relations, and political structures.2.1 Tribal Society and GovernanceArabian society was organized along tribal lines, with loyalty to kinship groups forming the basis of social cohesion and political power. Conflict resolution, economic exchange, and security depended on tribal alliances. There was no centralized authority comparable to the Roman or Byzantine empires; power was localized and heavily reliant on tribal networks.2.2 Religious Practices and PolytheismPre-Islamic Arabia, often referred to as theJahiliyyahperiod, was marked by polytheism, veneration of natural elements, and localized cultic practices. While Judaism, Christianity, and other monotheistic faiths existed in pockets of Arabia, the dominant religious environment was polytheistic. Mecca, Muhammad’s birthplace, housed the Kaaba as a religious center with numerous idols representing tribal deities.2.3 Trade and Cultural ExchangeMecca’s position as a trading hub facilitated interactions with the Byzantine and Sassanian empires, introducing ideas from Judaism, Christianity, and other monotheistic traditions. These contacts likely influenced the religious vocabulary and concepts Muhammad later incorporated into his teachings. The economic significance of trade also amplified the political and social leverage of Meccan elites.2.4 Oral Tradition and LiteracyThe Arabian Peninsula had low literacy rates, and religious, legal, and historical knowledge was transmitted orally. Poetic and oral traditions were highly developed, providing a medium through which religious messages and social norms were preserved and disseminated. This context is crucial for understanding how the Quran, which was initially orally recited, was later compiled into written form.2.5 Comparative Religious ContextWithin this environment, Muhammad’s claims emerged amidst existing monotheistic traditions. Judaism and Christianity had established textual canons and recorded prophetic histories, which provided models of recognized prophecy: tangible miracles, fulfilled prophecies, and communal verification. Muhammad’s emergence in this context invites comparison, particularly regarding the presence or absence of similar validating signs.This concludes Part 1. It sets the stage for a critical, historically informed analysis of Muhammad’s life and prophetic claims.Next Sections (to be expanded in detail):Biography and Life of MuhammadTextual Analysis of the QuranThe Hadith Literature and Reported MiraclesAbsence of Verifiable Supernatural SignsSociopolitical Dimensions of Muhammad’s MissionComparative Prophetic StandardsScholarly Critique and DebatesConclusion3. Biography and Life of MuhammadMuhammad’s life, as documented in Islamic tradition, is divided into several stages: early life in Mecca, initial revelation and public ministry, migration (Hijra) to Medina, political consolidation, and military campaigns. A critical examination of these stages highlights the historical, textual, and sociopolitical contexts of his claim to prophethood.3.1 Early Life in Mecca (c. 570–610 CE)Muhammad was born in Mecca around 570 CE into the Quraysh tribe, a prominent merchant clan. His father, Abdullah, died before his birth, and his mother, Amina, died when he was six, leaving him an orphan under the care of his grandfather and later his uncle, Abu Talib.Historical sources describe Muhammad as a trustworthy and honest figure even before his prophetic claims, earning the nicknameal-Amin(“the trustworthy”). While these traits are significant socially, they do not, in themselves, confirm divine inspiration. It is also notable that Mecca, at the time, was a thriving commercial center, with extensive trade links to the Byzantine and Sassanian empires. Exposure to Jewish and Christian communities likely shaped Muhammad’s awareness of monotheistic ideas, which later influenced the Quranic narrative.3.2 First Revelation and Early Ministry (610–622 CE)At approximately 40 years old, Muhammad claimed to receive his first revelation in the Cave of Hira near Mecca. According to Islamic sources, the angel Gabriel delivered messages from God, later forming the Quran.Critically, the initial revelations and the early message emphasized monotheism, social justice, and moral rectitude. However, there is no independent historical evidence confirming that Muhammad’s experience was genuinely supernatural. The sources documenting these events—the Quran and hadith—were compiled decades later and may reflect posthumous theological development rather than contemporaneous verification.Muhammad’s early preaching faced significant opposition from the Quraysh elites, who were invested in the polytheistic religious and economic structure of Mecca. This opposition led to social ostracism and limited the reach of his early mission. While resistance is historically plausible, it also highlights that the early reception of his prophetic claims relied heavily on social influence rather than verifiable miracles.3.3 Migration to Medina (Hijra) and Political Leadership (622–632 CE)The migration to Medina in 622 CE marked a turning point. Muhammad transitioned from a primarily religious figure to a socio-political leader. In Medina, he negotiated alliances with tribes, established legal and social frameworks, and served as a mediator and judge.This period raises critical questions about the intertwining of religious authority with political power. While Muhammad’s leadership unified previously fragmented tribes, it also provided the means to consolidate influence. Scholars note that religious authority in this context was inseparable from political and military strategy. Muhammad’s ability to command loyalty and enforce laws may have bolstered perceptions of prophetic legitimacy, independent of verifiable divine signs.3.4 Military Campaigns and ExpansionMuhammad led multiple military campaigns against opposing tribes, including the Quraysh, and sought to expand his influence across the Arabian Peninsula. Battles such as Badr, Uhud, and the Trench, along with the eventual conquest of Mecca, were instrumental in establishing the nascent Islamic state.From a critical perspective, the success of these campaigns, while historically significant, reflects strategic acumen rather than divine endorsement. Unlike biblical prophets whose authority was frequently validated by miracles witnessed by contemporaries, Muhammad’s political and military achievements can be understood as humanly orchestrated events.3.5 Death and LegacyMuhammad died in 632 CE in Medina, leaving behind a religious and political community that rapidly expanded under subsequent caliphs. The posthumous compilation of the Quran and hadith played a crucial role in shaping the perception of his prophetic authority.Critically, the reliance on texts compiled decades after Muhammad’s death introduces challenges for historical verification. Many events attributed to him, including miraculous acts, were documented through oral traditions subject to interpretation, selective memory, and theological motivation. This temporal gap complicates the assessment of his claims to divine authority.Summary of Critical Observations from Biography:Muhammad’s early life and social reputation demonstrate personal integrity but do not confirm divine inspiration.Initial revelations, while foundational for Islam, lack independent verification as supernatural events.His political and military leadership in Medina intertwined religious authority with human strategy, complicating the evaluation of prophetic legitimacy.Posthumous compilation of the Quran and hadith raises questions about historical reliability.Unlike recognized prophets in Abrahamic traditions, Muhammad’s claimed miracles lack contemporaneous, independently verified witnesses.4. Textual Analysis of the QuranThe Quran is considered by Muslims to be Muhammad’s primary miracle, revealed to him over 23 years. Unlike biblical prophets, whose miracles were typically observable events, Muhammad’s miracles are largely textual and spiritual. A critical examination of the Quran requires evaluating its historical compilation, linguistic claims, and authenticity.4.1 The Quran as a MiracleIslamic tradition holds that the Quran’s linguistic beauty, coherence, and depth are inimitable (i‘jaz al-Quran), and thus serve as proof of Muhammad’s divine inspiration. The Quran itself challenges skeptics to produce a sura comparable to it (Quran 2:23).From a scholarly perspective, while the Quran is undeniably a remarkable literary work, several considerations challenge its status as a supernatural proof:Human literary context:Muhammad lived in a society with a rich oral poetic tradition. Arab poets were highly skilled in crafting elaborate and emotive verse, and the Quran’s style may reflect this cultural milieu rather than purely divine origin.Variations in early manuscripts:Early Quranic manuscripts, such as the Sana’a palimpsest, reveal textual variants. While Muslims argue these differences are minor, they complicate claims of a perfectly preserved, divinely dictated text.Dependence on oral transmission:The Quran was initially transmitted orally before compilation. Oral transmission introduces potential errors, selective memory, and interpretative influence, which may affect the claim of a miraculous, unaltered text.4.2 Compilation of the QuranThe Quran was compiled into a written form after Muhammad’s death under the Caliph Abu Bakr and later standardized under Uthman. Historical-critical scholarship notes several issues:Posthumous compilation:Muhammad did not leave a complete written Quran, relying on memorization and partial written fragments.Editorial decisions:Uthman’s standardization involved selecting one version over others and destroying variant texts, raising questions about the preservation and authenticity of the final compilation.Historical context:The compilation process reflects sociopolitical needs of unity within the early Muslim community rather than purely divine instruction.These factors challenge the idea that the Quran exists as a verified, supernatural proof of Muhammad’s prophetic authority.4.3 Content AnalysisThe Quran contains moral guidance, historical narratives, and eschatological promises. However, critical analysis raises several points:Borrowed narratives:Stories of previous prophets (Moses, Jesus, Noah) closely resemble biblical accounts, sometimes with significant modifications. This suggests Muhammad’s teachings drew from existing monotheistic traditions rather than presenting entirely new revelation.Ambiguous prophecies:Many prophetic statements are either vague or interpreted retrospectively, which limits their utility as proof of divine insight.Historical inconsistencies:Certain Quranic accounts, such as the narratives of Pharaoh or earlier civilizations, contain historical inaccuracies when compared with archaeological and textual evidence. These inconsistencies challenge claims of infallible divine knowledge.4.4 Comparative Prophetic StandardsProphets in the Abrahamic tradition are typically validated by:Observable, contemporaneously witnessed miracles.Fulfillment of precise predictions.Immediate recognition by independent witnesses.The Quran, as Muhammad’s claimed miracle, fails to meet these criteria:It is a textual miracle, not a tangible, independently verified phenomenon.Its compilation occurred decades later, relying on memory and selective recording.Its content often mirrors pre-existing traditions rather than providing unique, verifiable predictions or miracles.4.5 Scholarly PerspectivesWestern scholars, such as Patricia Crone, Michael Cook, and W. Montgomery Watt, highlight the Quran’s historical and literary development, noting influences from Jewish, Christian, and Arabian sources. While they recognize Muhammad’s significance as a religious and political figure, they also emphasize that the Quran’s miraculous status is largely a matter of faith rather than empirically verifiable proof.Summary of Textual AnalysisThe Quran’s status as a supernatural miracle is challenged by historical, literary, and textual evidence.Compilation processes introduce uncertainty regarding its authenticity and preservation.Many narratives and prophecies draw on pre-existing sources, reducing the claim of unique divine origin.By Abrahamic standards of prophetic verification, the Quran alone is insufficient to conclusively establish Muhammad’s prophethood.5. The Hadith Literature and Reported MiraclesThe Hadith literature—collections of sayings, actions, and approvals attributed to Muhammad—plays a central role in Islamic theology and provides the primary source for accounts of his miracles. A critical evaluation of these sources is essential for assessing the validity of Muhammad’s claimed supernatural powers.5.1 Overview of Hadith LiteratureHadiths were compiled primarily in the 9th century, approximately 200 years after Muhammad’s death. The most widely recognized collections areSahih al-Bukhari,Sahih Muslim, and others, which Muslims regard as authoritative.The process of hadith collection involved:Isnad (Chain of Transmission):Scholars evaluated the reliability of narrators.Matn (Textual Content):Scholars examined the content for consistency with known facts and theology.Classification:Hadiths were categorized assahih(authentic),hasan(good), orda’if(weak).While the isnad system attempts to establish credibility, it is important to note:The system developed centuries after the events it describes.Many narrators are unknown outside Islamic scholarly circles.Oral transmission introduces errors, embellishments, and theological interpretation.Thus, the hadith literature’s reliability as historical evidence is inherently limited.5.2 Major Reported MiraclesSeveral miracles attributed to Muhammad are frequently cited:Splitting of the Moon:According to reports, Muhammad split the moon as a sign for skeptics. Critical evaluation:No contemporaneous records outside Islamic sources corroborate this event.Astronomical observations of the period provide no evidence of such an occurrence.The story appears only in posthumous hadith compilations, raising questions of authenticity.Isra and Mi’raj (Night Journey and Ascension):Muhammad reportedly traveled to Jerusalem and ascended to heaven in a single night. Critical evaluation:The event lacks empirical verification.Descriptions vary widely between hadith collections, suggesting legend development.The narrative resembles earlier apocalyptic and visionary literature, raising the possibility of literary borrowing rather than literal occurrence.Water Miracles and Multiplications:Reports describe Muhammad producing water from rocks or multiplying food. Critical evaluation:Accounts are anecdotal, with inconsistencies between narrators.No independent, contemporaneous evidence exists to confirm these events.Healing and Predictions:Certain hadiths report healings or predictions of future events. Critical evaluation:Many predictions are vague or retrospectively interpreted.Healing claims often reflect common practices of the time rather than miraculous intervention.5.3 Challenges of Posthumous NarrationHadiths were compiled centuries after Muhammad’s life, creating opportunities for embellishment.Narratives may reflect theological or political agendas of early Muslim communities.Miraculous accounts are often inconsistent across sources, undermining historical reliability.The reliance on posthumous narration contrasts sharply with biblical prophetic traditions, where miracles were observed and documented by contemporaries. For example, Jesus’ healings and exorcisms were witnessed by multiple independent sources, providing contemporaneous validation.5.4 Comparative Analysis of MiraclesObservable vs. Textual:Abrahamic prophets typically demonstrated miracles visible to contemporaries; Muhammad’s miracles are primarily textual or anecdotal.Immediate Verification:Unlike Moses’ staff transforming into a serpent or Jesus’ raising of Lazarus, Muhammad’s miracles lack independent, immediate validation.Reliability of Sources:Hadiths, compiled long after the events, are less reliable than the contemporaneous accounts of previous prophets.5.5 Scholarly PerspectivesPatricia CroneandMichael Cookargue that many miraculous accounts in hadith literature are hagiographical, intended to reinforce faith rather than document historical events.W. Montgomery Wattacknowledges Muhammad’s religious significance but stresses that miracles in the hadith are not verifiable historical facts.5.6 Summary of Hadith AnalysisThe majority of Muhammad’s reported miracles rely on hadiths compiled centuries after his death.Accounts often conflict and lack independent corroboration.Unlike biblical prophets, Muhammad’s miracles were not observed or verified by contemporaries outside his followers.Consequently, these miracles cannot be treated as empirical proof of divine authority.Conclusion of Part 4:The Hadith literature, while central to Islamic faith, provides limited historical verification for Muhammad’s miracles. The combination of posthumous compilation, oral transmission, and lack of independent witnesses undermines the claim that these miracles can substantiate his prophetic authority.6. Absence of Verifiable Supernatural SignsA key criterion for validating prophetic claims in Abrahamic traditions is the demonstration of tangible, observable signs of divine authority. Prophets such as Moses, Elijah, and Jesus were recognized as genuine messengers because their miracles were witnessed by contemporaries and independently verifiable. In contrast, Muhammad’s claimed miracles, as explored in prior sections, largely fail to meet these standards.6.1 Definition of Prophetic ValidationIn biblical traditions, a prophet’s legitimacy was typically verified through three main criteria:Observable Miracles:Supernatural acts that could be witnessed and confirmed by contemporaries. Examples include Moses parting the Red Sea or Jesus healing the sick.Predictive Fulfillment:Clear prophecies about future events that were fulfilled as stated.Independent Verification:Confirmation by witnesses not affiliated with the prophet, providing external validation.These criteria serve as benchmarks for evaluating the authenticity of prophetic claims.6.2 Lack of Observable MiraclesMuhammad’s primary miracle, the Quran, is textual rather than physical. While influential, it does not constitute a verifiable, tangible miracle accessible to independent observation.Reported miracles in hadith, including the splitting of the moon, night journey (Isra and Mi’raj), and water multiplications, are documented decades after Muhammad’s death. These accounts lack contemporaneous, independent witnesses and are inconsistent across sources.Unlike biblical prophets, Muhammad’s miracles were not subject to immediate scrutiny or verification outside his inner circle.6.3 Predictive ClaimsThe Quran and Hadith contain some statements interpreted as prophecies. However, these predictions are often vague, retrospective, or reliant on flexible interpretation.Many events claimed to be predicted in Muhammad’s lifetime are only recognized as fulfilled through post-event interpretation, undermining their value as proof of divine foresight.Comparatively, biblical prophets frequently issued precise predictions, such as the Babylonian exile prophesied by Jeremiah, which were independently documented and historically verified.6.4 Independent VerificationContemporaneous external verification is largely absent for Muhammad’s miracles.Accounts of his supernatural acts originate from followers or posthumous compilations, making them susceptible to embellishment or theological motivation.This contrasts with prophets like Moses or Jesus, whose miracles were witnessed by independent groups, recorded in multiple sources, and recognized even by skeptics.6.5 Implications for Prophetic LegitimacyThe lack of verifiable supernatural signs has several implications:Reliance on Faith:Acceptance of Muhammad’s miracles depends largely on belief in the reliability of the Quran and Hadith, rather than empirical evidence.Historical Uncertainty:Historians face significant challenges in reconstructing the events of Muhammad’s life with certainty, particularly miraculous accounts.Comparative Deficit:When assessed against Abrahamic prophetic standards, Muhammad’s miracles fail to provide the same level of objective verification as those of Moses, Elijah, or Jesus.6.6 Scholarly PerspectivesPatricia Cronenotes that many miraculous accounts in Islamic tradition may reflect hagiography and theological embellishment rather than historical events.Michael Cookemphasizes the historical development of Muhammad’s image, suggesting that some miracle narratives served to legitimize his authority posthumously.W. Montgomery Wattrecognizes Muhammad’s impact as a religious leader but differentiates between historical significance and verifiable supernatural proof.6.7 SummaryMuhammad’s miracles are primarily textual or anecdotal, lacking independent verification.Predicted events are often vague or recognized only retrospectively.Compared with recognized Abrahamic prophets, Muhammad’s claims exhibit a deficit in observable, verifiable divine signs.Historical, textual, and critical analysis challenges the claim that Muhammad’s life provides empirical evidence of prophetic legitimacy.Conclusion of Part 5:The absence of verifiable supernatural signs raises critical questions regarding Muhammad’s claim to prophethood. While his religious and political influence is historically undeniable, the lack of tangible, independently witnessed miracles or precise predictive fulfillment differentiates him from recognized prophets in earlier Abrahamic traditions.7. Sociopolitical Dimensions of Muhammad’s MissionMuhammad’s claim to prophethood did not exist in isolation; it was deeply intertwined with the political, social, and military context of 7th-century Arabia. A critical assessment of his leadership reveals the extent to which his religious authority was reinforced—or perhaps facilitated—by sociopolitical power.7.1 Emergence as a Political LeaderFollowing the migration (Hijra) to Medina in 622 CE, Muhammad assumed roles that combined religious, judicial, and political authority. He negotiated treaties, mediated tribal disputes, and established social and legal frameworks for the Muslim community.Constitution of Medina:This document established Muhammad as the central authority, uniting diverse tribes under a common legal and political system.Judicial Authority:Muhammad adjudicated disputes between Muslims and non-Muslims, functioning as a judge and lawgiver.Social Regulation:He implemented rules regarding marriage, inheritance, and religious observance.Critically, his authority was not solely spiritual; it derived from his ability to consolidate power and enforce laws. This raises the question: to what extent did perceptions of prophetic legitimacy depend on demonstrable divine signs versus effective political leadership?7.2 Military Campaigns and AuthorityMuhammad led several military campaigns, including the battles of Badr, Uhud, and the Trench. These campaigns were crucial in:Defending the Muslim communityfrom hostile tribes, especially the Quraysh of Mecca.Expanding political influenceacross the Arabian Peninsula.Consolidating authority, as military success often legitimized leadership in tribal societies.From a critical perspective, military victories may have bolstered Muhammad’s perceived divine support. Followers could interpret political and military success as confirmation of prophetic legitimacy, even in the absence of verifiable miracles.7.3 Integration of Religious and Political AuthorityMuhammad’s dual role as prophet and political leader is unique among Abrahamic prophets. While Moses also held political authority during the Exodus, his miracles—parting the Red Sea, providing manna—provided independent divine validation. Muhammad’s authority, by contrast, relied heavily on leadership skills, strategic alliances, and social organization.Religious Legitimacy Through Governance:The successful establishment of an Islamic state in Medina and later conquest of Mecca reinforced Muhammad’s position as a divinely chosen leader in the eyes of followers.Influence on Legal and Social Norms:His rulings became the foundation for Islamic law (Sharia), further solidifying his authority.Potential for Human Agency:The intertwining of religion and politics may indicate that some aspects of his prophetic persona were reinforced through pragmatic human strategy rather than solely divine intervention.7.4 Implications for Evaluating Prophetic ClaimsThe sociopolitical dimension of Muhammad’s mission has several implications:Perception vs. Verification:Political and military achievements could create a perception of divine authority, even without empirical miracles.Human Agency in Religious Leadership:Effective governance may enhance religious legitimacy, but it does not substitute for verifiable supernatural signs.Comparison With Other Prophets:While other prophets also exercised social or political influence, Muhammad’s consolidation of power is distinct in its integration of religious, judicial, and military roles.7.5 Scholarly PerspectivesW. Montgomery Wattemphasizes Muhammad’s strategic and political acumen, suggesting that his leadership skills contributed significantly to his authority.Patricia CroneandMichael Cookhighlight the social and political environment as a factor in the shaping of Muhammad’s prophetic image. They argue that many elements of his leadership—tribal alliances, military campaigns, and legal authority—may have reinforced perceptions of divine endorsement.These perspectives indicate that Muhammad’s influence cannot be evaluated solely on textual or miraculous claims; sociopolitical factors played a critical role.7.6 SummaryMuhammad’s authority combined religious, judicial, and political power.Military victories and governance enhanced perceptions of divine legitimacy.The integration of politics and religion complicates the assessment of his prophetic claim.Unlike prophets validated primarily by supernatural signs, Muhammad’s leadership achievements could substitute, in the eyes of followers, for tangible miracles.Conclusion of Part 6:Muhammad’s sociopolitical leadership significantly reinforced his perceived prophetic authority. While this demonstrates his effectiveness as a leader, it does not constitute independent proof of divine selection. When evaluated against Abrahamic standards of prophetic validation—observable miracles, predictive fulfillment, and independent verification—political and military success cannot substitute for verifiable supernatural signs.Excellent. Let’s proceed withPart 7: Comparative Prophetic Standards, which systematically evaluates Muhammad’s claims against recognized prophets in Abrahamic traditions.8. Comparative Prophetic StandardsTo critically assess Muhammad’s prophethood, it is instructive to compare his claims and reported miracles with the standards applied to recognized prophets in Judaism and Christianity. Prophetic legitimacy in these traditions is typically established through observable miracles, fulfilled prophecies, and independent verification.8.1 Observable MiraclesAbrahamic Examples:Moses:Demonstrated divine authority through multiple miracles, including turning his staff into a serpent (Exodus 7:10–12) and parting the Red Sea (Exodus 14:21–22). These acts were witnessed by large groups and recorded contemporaneously.Elijah:Performed miracles such as raising the widow’s son (1 Kings 17:17–24) and calling down fire from heaven (1 Kings 18:36–38).Jesus:Performed healings, exorcisms, and even resurrection (Mark 5:21–43), with accounts documented by multiple independent sources.Muhammad:Reported miracles, such as the splitting of the moon and the Isra and Mi’raj, are primarily documented in hadith literature compiled decades later.They lack independent, contemporaneous witnesses.Most miracles are textual or anecdotal rather than observable events.Assessment:Muhammad’s miracles fail to meet the standard of verifiable, witnessed supernatural acts.8.2 Predictive FulfillmentAbrahamic Examples:Isaiah and Jeremiah:Delivered precise prophecies about the Babylonian exile and return of Israel (Isaiah 44–45; Jeremiah 25).Jesus:Predicted his own death and resurrection (Mark 8:31; 9:31) and the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple (Matthew 24:1–2). These predictions were verifiable and occurred within a predictable timeframe.Muhammad:Some Quranic verses and hadith are interpreted as prophecies (e.g., the conquest of Mecca or battles with enemies).Many predictions are vague or only recognized retrospectively.There is a lack of precise, independently verified prophetic fulfillment in real-time.Assessment:Muhammad’s predictive claims are weaker than those of biblical prophets due to ambiguity and post-event interpretation.8.3 Independent VerificationAbrahamic Examples:Moses’ miracles were witnessed by large groups of Israelites and recorded in contemporaneous texts.Jesus’ healings and resurrection were documented by multiple authors with diverse audiences, providing corroboration.Muhammad:Verification relies on oral traditions and hadith compiled centuries later.Independent, neutral witnesses outside the early Muslim community are absent.Historical records from Byzantine, Persian, or Arabian sources do not corroborate miraculous events.Assessment:The lack of independent verification undermines Muhammad’s claim to supernatural authority.8.4 Contextual ConsiderationsBiblical prophets often operated within empires or societies with established record-keeping, allowing independent verification.Muhammad operated in a largely oral, tribal society, which may explain the reliance on posthumous narrations.While sociopolitical factors enhanced perceived legitimacy, they do not substitute for the traditional markers of divine endorsement.8.5 Scholarly PerspectivesPatricia Croneargues that many miracle narratives about Muhammad are hagiographical, intended to legitimize his authority posthumously.Michael Cookemphasizes that Muhammad’s political and social successes contributed to the perception of divine sanction, independent of miraculous proof.W. Montgomery Wattacknowledges Muhammad’s historical significance but stresses that religious impact does not equate to verifiable prophetic validation.8.6 Summary of Comparative AnalysisObservable miracles:Muhammad’s reported miracles lack contemporaneous, independent witnesses.Predictive fulfillment:Prophecies are vague and often recognized only retrospectively.Independent verification:Absence of corroboration outside early Muslim sources weakens the claim of divine authority.Overall assessment:Compared with Moses, Elijah, and Jesus, Muhammad’s claim to prophethood falls short by Abrahamic standards of verification and legitimacy.Conclusion of Part 7:When evaluated against traditional Abrahamic prophetic standards, Muhammad’s reported miracles, predictive claims, and historical documentation do not provide sufficient empirical evidence to confirm his prophetic authority. While his religious, social, and political influence is historically undeniable, the lack of verifiable supernatural signs differentiates him from prophets whose legitimacy was demonstrable and independently recognized.9. Scholarly Critique and DebatesThe question of Muhammad’s prophethood has been a subject of significant academic debate, encompassing historical, textual, and theological analyses. Scholars from both Western and Islamic traditions offer perspectives that illuminate the challenges of evaluating his claims critically.9.1 Western Scholarly PerspectivesPatricia CroneCrone argues that much of what is known about Muhammad’s life and miracles derives from hagiographical sources compiled well after his death.She emphasizes that early Islamic narratives often serve theological and political agendas, rather than historical accuracy.According to Crone, the miraculous accounts attributed to Muhammad, such as the splitting of the moon, are likely legendary developments rather than contemporaneously verified events.Michael CookCook highlights the sociopolitical environment of 7th-century Arabia as central to understanding Muhammad’s influence.He contends that Muhammad’s authority may have been reinforced by his leadership and strategic alliances rather than by observable miracles.Cook’s analysis suggests that the perception of divine sanction may have emerged posthumously to consolidate community cohesion.W. Montgomery WattWatt acknowledges Muhammad’s profound historical and religious significance.However, he distinguishes between Muhammad’s historical impact and verifiable prophetic legitimacy, noting that most miracle narratives rely on posthumous textual sources rather than contemporaneous observation.9.2 Islamic Scholarly PerspectivesIslamic scholars generally defend Muhammad’s prophethood, emphasizing faith and theological coherence over historical verification:I‘jaz (Inimitability) ArgumentScholars assert that the Quran itself is a miracle, inimitable in its language and message.Critics note that this argument relies on literary and linguistic standards rather than empirical, observable phenomena.Miracle Validation Through FaithIslamic tradition often interprets Muhammad’s sociopolitical success, moral character, and Quranic message as implicit proof of divine sanction.While compelling for believers, these forms of validation differ from empirical verification used to assess biblical prophets.Hadith AuthenticationScholars employ isnad (chain of transmission) and matn (textual content) analysis to establish the reliability of miracles.Western scholars critique these methods as insufficient for independent historical validation, given the centuries-long gap between Muhammad’s life and hadith compilation.9.3 Critical Themes in Scholarly DebateTemporal Gap Between Events and DocumentationHadiths and biographical texts were compiled decades or centuries after Muhammad’s death, allowing for potential embellishment.Many miracle accounts appear in later sources, with no contemporaneous corroboration.Sociopolitical Reinforcement of AuthorityMuhammad’s political, military, and social leadership likely contributed to perceptions of divine authority.Scholars argue that this raises the possibility that some aspects of his prophetic image were socially constructed.Comparative Evaluation of Prophetic StandardsWhen measured against Abrahamic criteria—observable miracles, predictive fulfillment, and independent verification—Muhammad’s claims exhibit notable deficiencies.Western scholarship often emphasizes these comparative benchmarks to critically evaluate prophetic legitimacy.9.4 Summary of Scholarly PerspectivesWestern scholarship:Emphasizes historical-critical methods, highlighting posthumous narration, lack of independent verification, and sociopolitical influences as factors weakening claims of prophetic legitimacy.Islamic scholarship:Emphasizes faith, literary inimitability, and moral authority as evidence of prophethood, often prioritizing theological coherence over empirical verification.Consensus for critical evaluation:While Muhammad’s historical and religious impact is undeniable, the evidence for supernatural verification remains limited, and reliance on posthumous narratives complicates historical assessment.9.5 Implications for Academic StudyMuhammad’s life and mission remain crucial subjects for historical, theological, and sociopolitical analysis.Critical scholarship encourages differentiation between religious belief, historical influence, and empirical verification of prophetic claims.The debate illustrates the broader challenge of reconciling faith-based accounts with historical-critical methodology.Conclusion of Part 8:Scholarly analysis underscores the distinction between Muhammad’s profound historical significance and the verifiable evidence for his prophetic claims. While Islamic tradition presents numerous miracles and divine endorsements, historical-critical evaluation reveals limitations in independent verification, temporal reliability, and alignment with Abrahamic prophetic standards.10. ConclusionA comprehensive examination of Muhammad’s life, the Quran, the Hadith, and historical context reveals a complex interplay between religious claims, sociopolitical influence, and posthumous textual documentation. While Muhammad’s impact as a religious and political leader is historically undeniable, critical evaluation exposes significant limitations in the verifiable evidence supporting his prophetic authority.10.1 Summary of Key FindingsBiographical AnalysisMuhammad’s early life demonstrated personal integrity and leadership qualities but provided no independent evidence of divine inspiration.His political and military success, particularly after the migration to Medina, reinforced perceptions of authority but did not constitute observable miracles.Textual Evidence: The QuranThe Quran, while linguistically and literarily remarkable, is a textual rather than observable miracle.Compilation decades after Muhammad’s death, coupled with reliance on oral transmission, complicates claims of divine origin.Many narratives in the Quran borrow from existing Jewish and Christian traditions, limiting its uniqueness as evidence of prophecy.Hadith Literature and Reported MiraclesReported miracles, including the splitting of the moon, the night journey (Isra and Mi’raj), and water multiplications, are documented posthumously, with no independent, contemporaneous verification.Inconsistencies across sources and the late compilation of hadiths undermine the reliability of these accounts as evidence of divine sanction.Absence of Verifiable Supernatural SignsUnlike biblical prophets, Muhammad’s life lacks observable, independently verified miracles and precise predictive fulfillment.Reliance on faith and posthumous textual accounts differentiates his claim from the empirical validation associated with Abrahamic prophetic traditions.Sociopolitical DimensionsMuhammad’s consolidation of political, judicial, and military power enhanced perceptions of divine legitimacy among followers.While effective for social cohesion and leadership, sociopolitical success cannot substitute for tangible evidence of supernatural authority.Comparative Prophetic StandardsWhen evaluated against Abrahamic benchmarks—observable miracles, predictive fulfillment, and independent verification—Muhammad’s claims fall short.Historical-critical scholarship highlights the differences between Muhammad’s posthumous textual miracles and the contemporaneously witnessed miracles of earlier prophets.Scholarly DebateWestern scholarship emphasizes the limitations of historical verification, posthumous narration, and sociopolitical influence.Islamic scholarship defends prophethood through faith, moral authority, and literary inimitability but relies on theological rather than empirical validation.10.2 Final AssessmentThe weight of historical and textual evidence suggests that Muhammad’s claim to prophethood cannot be substantiated using empirical, independently verifiable criteria. While his moral character, leadership, and influence are significant, they do not equate to observable miracles or precise, verifiable prophecy.This analysis does not diminish Muhammad’s historical or religious significance but emphasizes a critical distinction:historical influence and spiritual leadership are not synonymous with verified divine authority.10.3 Implications for Further StudyHistorical-Critical Research:Future scholarship should continue to examine early Islamic sources using rigorous historical methods, comparing them with contemporaneous records from Byzantine, Persian, and Arabian contexts.Comparative Prophetic Studies:A systematic comparison between Muhammad and recognized biblical prophets may illuminate broader patterns in claims to divine authority and their sociopolitical context.Faith and Historical Evidence:The study underscores the tension between faith-based acceptance and historical verification, highlighting the need for careful distinction in academic discourse.Conclusion Statement:Muhammad’s life, teachings, and legacy shaped the course of world history and the spiritual lives of billions. However, when evaluated against established Abrahamic standards of prophecy—observable miracles, fulfilled predictions, and independent verification—the evidence for his divine appointment remains unsubstantiated. The critical examination affirms the importance of historical rigor in distinguishing between religious influence and empirical validation of prophetic claims.",

Why is this hard? Allah has already finished the matter by saying that all Muslims will enter Hell.I KNOW MUSLIMS will start arguing— “Oh, you don’t know the Quran,” “Oh, you misinterpreted the verses.” Let me add more verses from their own Quran that expose them again.SURAT AT-TAKAATHUR, revealed in Mecca, tells Muslims:3.

    "full_content": "THE ISLAMIC SPIRIT-PROPHET MUHAMMAD CANNOT SAVE ANY FOLLOWER OF ISLAMBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis scholarly article critically evaluates the Islamic belief that Muhammad and the Qur’an provide a path to eternal life. By examining key Qur’anic declarations, Hadith testimonies, and historical Islamic sources, this study demonstrates that Muhammad himself confessed ignorance about his own salvation, was influenced by deceptive spiritual encounters, and failed to reveal any redemptive path comparable to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. This research uses a comparative theological method, engaging Biblical revelation as the ultimate standard for salvation and divine truth.1. Introduction: The Question of Salvation in IslamEvery religion grapples with the central question of human destiny:How can a person obtain eternal life?Islam claims that obedience to Allah and imitation of Muhammad will lead believers to Paradise. Yet, when Islam’s primary sources are examined critically, a theological crisis emerges:Muhammad never offered assurance of salvation.Muhammad confessed uncertainty about his own eternal destiny.Muhammad admitted receiving revelations from a being whose nature he could not verify.The Qur’an offers no Savior, no atonement, and no Redeemer comparable to the biblical Jesus Christ.Thus, the Islamic path cannot provide eternal life, because its very founder did not know whether he himself was saved.2. Muhammad's Confession: He Did Not Know His DestinyIslamic theology claims Muhammad is the final prophet and the model for salvation. Yet the Qur’an records Muhammad openly admitting that he hadno assurance of salvation—neither for himself nor for his followers:Qur’anic Evidence“I am not something original among the messengers, nor do I know what will be done with me or with you.”—Surah Al-Ahqaf 46:9This confession alone invalidates any claim that Muhammad can provide eternal life. A guide who does not know where he is going cannot lead others to safety.3. The Veil of Spiritual Blindness Over IslamThe Qur’an and Hadith indicate that a spiritual veil—introduced through Muhammad’s encounters—blinded his followers from the truth of salvation. The apostle Paul describes such deception:“…the god of this world has blinded the minds of unbelievers…”—2 Corinthians 4:4Islamic tradition itself describes Muhammad being influenced and deceived spiritually, demonstrating that his revelations were often unclear, contradictory, or spiritually corrupted.4. Did Muhammad Encounter a Demonic Being?4.1 Muhammad’s Fear That the Spirit Was a DemonWhen Muhammad first saw the being who delivered the Qur’an, he feared demon-possession:Hadith EvidenceAisha reports:Muhammad feared ajinnhad possessed him.—Sahih Bukhari, Book of Revelation, Hadith 3—Sirat Ibn Ishaq, pp. 106–107This directly contradicts the biblical pattern in which true prophetsimmediatelyrecognize the presence of God.4.2 The “Satanic Verses”: Muhammad Confessed He Spoke Words from SatanIslamic historical sources state that Muhammad delivered revelations that he later admitted came from Satan:Historical Source EvidenceMuhammad confessed that Satan had “interfered with the message” he recited.—Al-Tabari, Vol. 6, p. 111—Ibn Sa’d,Kitab al-Tabaqat, Vol. 1This is known as theSatanic Verses incident, universally accepted by early Islamic scholars.If a prophet confesses that Satan placed words in his mouth, he cannot be a trustworthy guide to eternal life.5. Allah Identified as a Deceptive Spirit in Islamic Texts5.1 “Allah” and Jinn Are Theologically MixedThe Qur’an says:“Among us [the jinn] are Muslims and among us are disbelievers.”—Surah Al-Jinn 72:14Islamic theology merges the identity of Allah’s followers with jinn—spiritual beings the Bible categorizes asdemons(Deuteronomy 32:17; Psalm 106:37; 1 Timothy 4:1).5.2 Hadith Confirms That the Spirit Appearing to Muhammad Was a Jinn“The one who came to me was an angel-like being, but at times I feared it was a jinn.”—Umdah al-Ahkam, Vol. 3, p. 460This confession is fatal to Islamic theology.5.3 Muhammad Was Forsaken and Left Sick by the SpiritThe Qur’an and Hadith describe a troubling episode:“Your Lord has neither forsaken you nor hated you.”—Surah Ad-Duhaa 93:1–3Hadith explains the context:Muhammad fell ill, and the spirit abandoned him for a period.—Sahih Bukhari 4950This demonstrates spiritual inconsistency—not the work of the God of the Bible.6. Muhammad Was a Sinner and Cannot Be a SaviorIslamic sources record Muhammad as:engaging in child marriage (Aisha, age 6;Sahih Bukhari 5133)ordering assassinationswaging wars of conquestconfessing sins repeatedly“Ask forgiveness for your sin.”—Surah Muhammad 47:19A sinner cannot save sinners.In contrast, the Bible declares Jesus Christsinless(Hebrews 4:15) and therefore able to offer salvation.7. Biblical Revelation: Salvation Comes Only Through Jesus ChristUnlike Muhammad, Jesus knew His destiny and offered eternal life with absolute authority:“I am the way, the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me.”—John 14:6“I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish.”—John 10:28Jesus alone is:sinless (1 Peter 2:22)divine (Titus 2:13)risen from the dead (Romans 1:4)Savior of the world (John 4:42)Muhammad admitted he could not save himself; Jesus Christ saves everyone who believes.8. Conclusion: Muhammad Cannot Save—Only Jesus Christ CanIslam offers no Savior.Muhammad:did not know his destiny (46:9)feared demonic possessionspoke satanic revelations (Tabari 6:111)was forsaken by the spiritconfessed his sinsdied, decayed, and remains deadHe cannot give what he did not have—eternal life.Jesus Christ alone conquered death and offers salvation to all who believe.9. Final Call to All MuslimsDear Muslim reader,Your eternal destiny is precious. Your soul is eternal. Muhammad cannot save you because he could not save himself.Jesus Christ—Yeshua Ha-Meshiach—loves you, died for you, and rose again to give you eternal life.“For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son…”—John 3:16Turn to Him today.He alone is the Savior of the world.El-Shaddai loves you—in Jesus’ Name.",

Yet we see other beings speaking inside the Quran.ISA SON OF MARY ALSO SPEAKS IN THE QURANSurat Maryam verse 36:And indeed Allah is my Lord and your Lord. So worship Him. This is the Straight Path.Isa also spoke in the Quran. But Muhammad himself never said anything in the Quran, nor was his birth mentioned in the Quran. This is a great disaster for MUSLIMS.ALLAH HIMSELF REVEALS A VERSE SAYING MUHAMMAD IS INSANEQuran 15:6:And they said: O you to whom the Reminder has been sent down! You are surely insane.MY QUESTION TO MUSLIMS IS VERY SIMPLE:WHO IS THE SPEAKER IN THE QURAN?WHOSE WORDS ARE IN THE QURAN?If you can answer me with verses and without insults, today I will convert and become a Muslim.Muslims usually say: if you do not believe that the Quran is the word of God, then produce verses like those of the Quran, while we know that there are many verses whose speakers are others and not Allah.Now, we leave this confusion to Muslims to come and answer us without trembling.WHOSE WORDS ARE IN THE QURAN?You are very welcome to Jesus, the living One, who is the WORD OF LIFE.Dr. Max ShimbaMax Shimba Ministries",

Let’s Debate.In Islamic tradition, Angel Jibril (Gabriel) is said to have delivered the revelations of the Qur’an to Prophet Muhammad. But here’s a question that rarely gets asked:Did Jibril ever actually introduce himself to Muhammad by name?It might sound simple, but the answer isn’t obvious—and it opens a fascinating discussion about religious texts, tradition, and interpretation.The Traditional ViewMany Muslims and scholars assert that Jibril’s identity is clear in the Qur’an and Hadith. Even if he never says, “I am Jibril,” his role as the messenger of God is unmistakable. Proponents argue that his actions—delivering revelations, guiding the Prophet, and communicating divine messages—serve as sufficient identification.In other words,actions speak louder than words.For believers, the very function of Jibril confirms who he is, even without a verbal introduction.The Critical QuestionSkeptics point out something intriguing: Nowhere in the Qur’an or Hadith does Jibril explicitly say, “I am Jibril.” If such an important introduction occurred, shouldn’t it have been recorded? Critics suggest that tradition assumes his identity rather than documenting it directly.This raises deeper questions: How much of religious tradition relies on textual evidence, and how much relies on interpretation?Food for ThoughtMust a messenger identify themselves by name to be recognized?Are there parallels in other religious texts where messengers are recognized without explicitly stating their names?What does this debate tell us about the way traditions are recorded and transmitted?Your Turn to Join the DebateThis isn’t about mocking or dismissing belief—it’s about engaging critically with history and scripture. Whether you lean toward the traditional understanding or the skeptical view, asking questions like this can deepen our appreciation for religious texts and encourage thoughtful discussion.So, what do you think? Did Jibril ever introduce himself to Muhammad?",

It’s about critical thinking, textual study, and asking questions that deepen our understanding of history and scripture.So, Muslim friends, what do you think? Can you find it? Or is this one of those assumptions passed down through tradition? Let’s have a respectful, evidence-based discussion.“I will become a Muslim if you can show me even one verse—anywhere in the Qur’an or authentic Hadith—where the angel Jibril introduces himself to Muhammad by name as ‘Jibril.’”“Show me a single place—Qur’an or Hadith—where Jibril personally tells Muhammad, ‘I am Jibril.’ If you can, I will accept Islam today.”“Point to any text in Islamic scripture where the angel Jibril directly identifies himself to Muhammad. If such a statement exists, I will become a Muslim.”“Find one explicit verse or narration where Jibril introduces himself to Muhammad by name. If you can, I will embrace Islam.”“Provide one clear statement from the Qur’an or Hadith where Jibril says to Muhammad, ‘My name is Jibril.’ If you show it, I will convert to Islam.”Max Shimba Ministries Org.",

First, we will examine the plain meaning of Surah 18:85–86, and then look at the explanations and responses from various Muslims about this matter.Qur’an 18:85–86 (Full Quotation)Arabic:فَأَتْبَعَ سَبَبًا • حَتّىٰ إِذَا بَلَغَ مَغْرِبَ الشَّمْسِ وَجَدَهَا تَغْرُبُ فِي عَيْنٍ حَمِئَةٍ وَوَجَدَ عِندَهَا قَوْمًا ۗ قُلْنَا يَا ذَا الْقَرْنَيْنِ إِمَّا أَنْ تُعَذِّبَ وَإِمَّا أَنْ تَتَّخِذَ فِيهِمْ حُسْنًاTransliteration:Fa’ittabaʿa sababā.Hattā idhā balagha maghriba ash-shamsi wajadahā taghrubu fī ʿaynin ḥami’atin wa wajada ʿindahā qawman.Qulnā yā Dhā al-Qarnayn immā an tuʿaddhiba wa immā an tattakhidha fīhim ḥusnā.Literal English Translation:\"So he followed a way, until when he reached the setting place of the sun, he found it setting in a spring of muddy (dark) water, and he found near it a people. We said, ‘O Dhul-Qarnayn, you may punish them or treat them with kindness.’\"This is the verse your article analyzes and challenges.A Little AstronomyIt may not be widely known that the Muslim Abbasid, Arab, and Persian rulers were advanced in astronomy. They named many stars, and even corrected parts of Ptolemy’s astronomical tables. However, the sun is many times larger than the earth, and the earth travels around the sun. The sun does not set in a spring of muddy water.Who is Zul-Qarnain?We have no evidence that Muhammad ever told anyone exactly who Zul-Qarnain was. Muslims hold four primary views:1. Alexander the Great (Most Common Muslim View)Zul-Qarnain means “the one with two horns.” A legendary myth claimed Alexander the Great was a god and had two ram horns growing from his head. Although untrue (and inconvenient for designing a battle helmet), the myth was well known. Many Muslims believe Allah in Surah 18 was referring to Alexander.2. Cyrus I of PersiaHis empire combined two peoples—Medes and Persians—which some try to connect to “two horns.” Beyond that, nothing links him reliably.3. A Yemeni King Who Wore a Two-Horned HelmetSome Muslims hold this view.4. An Unknown FigureA minority view, but difficult because no one can clearly explain who this unknown man was.ConclusionIt does not matter who Zul-Qarnain was. If he believed the sun sets in a muddy spring, and the sun does not set in a muddy spring, then the story is false regardless of the identity of the character Muhammad referenced.Surah 18 Interpretations and ResponsesIdea 1: The Sun Literally Sets in a Muddy SpringEarly Muslims believed the Qur’an taught this literally.Islamic historianal-Tabari (vol. 1, p. 234)affirms this understanding.Another example:“[Dhu al-Qarnaiyn] witnessed the setting of the sun in its resting place in a black, stinking mud spring.”(al-Tabari vol. 5, pp. 173–174; also vol. 1, p. 371)Another related belief: the world sits on a giant fish (al-Tabari vol. 1, p. 220, 839–923 A.D.).Idea 2: The Sun Appeared to Alexander to Set in Lake Ithaca in MacedoniaThis view assumes:• Zul-Qarnain = Alexander• Alexander was a good Muslim (contradicted by his pagan temple)• Alexander traveled west far enough for such an illusion (he did not)Worse: Greek settlements existed hundreds of miles west of Ithaca (Spain, Sicily, etc.) centuries before Alexander. No Greek would believe the sun literally set in a Macedonian lake while Greek ships sailed far beyond it.Tertullian (Treatise on the Soul, ch. 49, p. 227) notes Aristotle also referenced western explorers—contradicting the idea entirely.Idea 3: The “Muddy Spring” Is the Atlantic OceanProblems:• The Atlantic is not muddy.• It is not black.• It is not a spring.• The sun does not set in the ocean.• Alexander, Cyrus, and the Yemeni kings never reached the Atlantic.• Surah 18 says Zul-Qarnainsawthe sun settinginit.Idea 4: The “Muddy Spring” Is the Black Sea Viewed by Cyrus IEven if Cyrus reached the eastern coast, the sun would not appear to set in the Black Sea if he traveled south and east of it.No evidence exists Cyrus traveled to modern Georgia, Armenia, or Azerbaijan.Idea 5: The “Muddy Spring” Is the Aegean SeaPersians knew Greeks and Spartans well. They knew no nation lived “beyond the sun” on the other side of an ocean.Idea 6: The “Muddy Spring” Is the Red SeaYemenis knew Abyssinia well. They would not believe the sun set into the Red Sea.Idea 7: The Phrase Is MetaphoricalIf metaphorical, the Qur’an failed to indicate that clearly, misleading early Muslims.All early Muslims took it literally.Nothing in the Qur’an suggests metaphoric language.Therefore, Muslims closest to Muhammad misunderstood—meaning the Qur’an misled them.Idea 8: Muhammad Was Recounting a DreamThis view collapses because:• Surah 18 presents Zul-Qarnain as a real historical figure.• Dreams cannot teach objective truth unless explained as dreams.• A prophet must not confuse dreaming with revelation.If millions believed Muhammad’s dream was historical fact, the error lies in failing to clarify the nature of the story.ConclusionRegardless of who Zul-Qarnain was—Alexander or another figure—the Qur’an presents asobjective truththat the sun sets in a spring of muddy water.Ancient people 1,000 years before Muhammad already knew the sun did not set beyond Spain.No early Muslim treated the verse as metaphor.All early Muslims believed the Qur’an never misleads.Yet Surah 18 teaches an impossible astronomical event.List of Qur’an TranslationsArberry, Arthur J.The Koran Interpreted.Macmillan Publishing Co., Inc. 1955.Dawood, N.J.The Koran.Penguin Books. 1956–1999.Malik, Farooq-i-Azam.English Translation of the Meaning of AL-QUR’AN: The Guidance for Mankind.1997.Pickthall, Mohammed Marmaduke.The Meaning of the Glorious Koran.Rodwell, J.M.The Koran.Ivy Books. 1993.Shakir, M.H.The Qur’an.12th U.S. Edition, 2001.Sher Ali, Maulawi.The Holy Qur’an.Islam International Publications (Ahmadiyya), 1997.Yusuf Ali, Abdullah.The Holy Qur-an: Translation and Commentary.King Fahd Complex.Other Reference Books•Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1958•The History of al-Tabari, SUNY PressGod bless you greatly.I amDr. Max Shimba,Servant of Jesus Christ, our Great God and Savior (Titus 2:13)For Max Shimba Ministries Org©2016 MAX SHIMBA MINISTRIES ORG.

    "full_content": "Was Muhammad Demonically Influenced? A Critical ExaminationBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThe question of Muhammad’s spiritual experiences has been debated for centuries. While Muslims hold him as the “Seal of the Prophets,” many early reports—including those from Islamic sources—raise serious questions about the origin of his revelations. This article critically examines the nature of Muhammad’s experiences, his own confessions of fear and confusion, and the moral consequences of his teachings, in light of biblical and historical evidence.Muhammad’s Early Experiences: Poet or Possessed?Islamic historical records state that when Muhammad first received “revelation” in the Cave of Hira, he was left terrified, trembling, and even contemplating suicide. The Qur’an itself records Muhammad’s accusers labeling him asmajnun(possessed by jinn) and a poet:“By your Lord’s grace, you are not mad [majnun].”(Qur’an 68:2)“Or do they say, ‘He is possessed’ (majnun)? Nay, he has brought them the truth.”(Qur’an 23:70)Sahih Hadith and theSirah(biography of Muhammad) recount how Muhammad feared he was possessed when he first encountered the spirit in Hira. Ibn Ishaq, the earliest biographer of Muhammad, writes that Muhammad said:“I thought I was possessed by a jinn, and I wished to throw myself down from a mountain.” (Ibn Ishaq,Sirat Rasul Allah, trans. Guillaume, p. 106)The Manifestations: Convulsions, Snorting, and FoamingThe Hadith record peculiar physical symptoms when Muhammad received revelation. These include twitching, foaming at the mouth, and roaring like a camel. Sahih al-Bukhari narrates:“Sometimes the revelation comes to me like the ringing of a bell… and sometimes the angel comes to me in the form of a man and talks to me and I grasp whatever he says.” (Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 1, Book 1, Hadith 2)Another narration states:“Revelation would descend upon him on an extremely cold day, and yet sweat would be dripping from his forehead.” (Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 1, Book 1, Hadith 2)These symptoms bear closer resemblance to spirit possession described in the New Testament (cf. Mark 9:17–18) than to the orderly and peaceful communication between God and His prophets.Moral Contradictions in Muhammad’s LifeIf Muhammad was indeed sent by God, his life and teachings should align with divine holiness. However, troubling actions attributed to him include:Child Marriage– Marriage to Aisha, reportedly at age six, consummated at age nine (Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 7, Book 62, Hadith 64).Domestic Violence– Qur’an 4:34 permits men to “strike” their wives if they are disobedient.Contradiction of Prior Revelation– Muhammad affirmed the Torah and the Gospel (Qur’an 5:46–48), yet his teachings directly contradicted them, especially concerning the crucifixion of Jesus (Qur’an 4:157).Would a holy God endorse such actions and contradictions?The Biblical Warning: Another GospelThe Apostle Paul warned against any “other gospel” preached, even by an angel:“But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed.” (Galatians 1:8)Muhammad’s teachings deny Christ’s divinity, crucifixion, and resurrection—all essential doctrines of salvation. By biblical standards, Muhammad introduced “another Jesus” and “another gospel” (2 Corinthians 11:4).ConclusionThe evidence from the Qur’an, Hadith, andSirashows Muhammad himself feared possession, while his physical manifestations resembled demonic influence. His moral life and teachings raise serious doubts about divine origin, especially when weighed against the holiness of God revealed in the Bible. For these reasons, Muhammad cannot be considered a true prophet of God. Instead, the biblical warning of deception through false prophets and false gospels appears directly relevant to his case.ReferencesThe Qur’an (68:2; 23:70; 5:46–48; 4:157).Ibn Ishaq.The Life of Muhammad: A Translation of Ibn Ishaq's Sirat Rasul Allah.

    "full_content": "Scientific Errors in the Quran: A Critical ExaminationAbstractThis article critically examines claims that the Quran contains scientifically accurate knowledge of natural phenomena. While some Muslim apologists assert that the Quran predicts modern scientific discoveries—from cosmology to embryology—analysis of key Quranic verses, classical exegesis, and contemporary science reveals inconsistencies. The findings demonstrate the importance of separating theological meaning from empirical science to preserve intellectual integrity.1. IntroductionThe Quran, central to Islamic faith, has often been interpreted by some scholars and apologists as containing references to advanced scientific knowledge. Claims include predictions of the Big Bang, planetary motion, human embryology, and cosmic phenomena. These claims are widely circulated online and in popular literature, sometimes accompanied by modern astronomical imagery, such as photographs from the Hubble Space Telescope.¹However, many of these purported miracles arise from interpreting metaphorical or vague language in the Quran as literal scientific statements. Verses describing the sun, moon, stars, or cosmic events often reflect observational knowledge from the 7th century rather than empirical insight into modern physics or astronomy. Misreading poetic language as literal evidence conflates spiritual guidance with scientific fact.²2. Linguistic Ambiguities and MisinterpretationsSeveral Quranic verses cited as evidence for scientific knowledge rely on ambiguous Arabic terms. For instance, the wordfalakin Surah 36:38 is often translated as “orbit” to imply heliocentric motion, but classical commentaries indicate it more accurately refers to a “course” or “swimming” across the sky.³ Similarly, the wordyasbahuna, describing celestial motion, literally means “swim,” not rotate on an axis, contrary to some modern interpretations.⁴Surah 55:37, describing the sky “becoming red like a rose,” illustrates the difficulty of translating metaphorical language. Translations vary widely: “red like ointment” (Yusuf Ali), “red like leather” (Shakir), or “burning oil” (Asad). These discrepancies demonstrate that the original Arabic is metaphorical, and projecting astronomical phenomena onto such verses is anachronistic.⁵3. Cosmological InaccuraciesSeveral Quranic statements contradict established scientific knowledge. Surah 18:86 describes the sun “setting in a muddy spring,” which conflicts with heliocentric astronomy.⁶ Verses suggesting celestial bodies travel in isolated orbits or rest in specific locations (Surah 36:38–40) reflect geocentric observation rather than modern astrophysics.⁷ Assertions that the Quran predicts the Big Bang rely on vague phrasing, such as “the heavens and the earth were joined together before We clove them asunder” (Surah 21:30), which can also be found in ancient mythologies and does not specify a scientific mechanism.⁸Muslim claims linking Surah 55:37 to Hubble images of nebulae fail to account for context. The verse refers to eschatological events, not observable stars, and the “sky” encompasses the entire cosmos, not individual celestial objects.⁹4. Biological InaccuraciesQuranic descriptions of embryology (Surah 23:12–14) describe humans as being created from a “clinging clot,” which does not align with modern embryology or genetics.¹⁰ While some claim these verses anticipate embryology, they reflect pre-modern anatomical knowledge observable without microscopes. Interpreting these descriptions as miracles projects contemporary understanding onto ancient text rather than recognizing metaphorical or observational context.¹¹5. Contextual and Interpretive ConsiderationsMany scientific claims stem from retroactive interpretation. Classical tafsir and reports from early scholars show these verses were understood literally in terms of appearance, not as scientific propositions. For instance, Muhammad is reported to have said the sun travels under the Throne of God (Bukhari vol.4, ch.54, no.441; al-Tabari vol.1, p.235), reflecting a geocentric worldview.¹²Furthermore, the Quran frequently employs poetic or symbolic language. Verses about the sky or celestial bodies primarily communicate theological truths, such as divine power and order, rather than empirical facts. Conflating literary or observational language with precise scientific predictions undermines intellectual honesty.¹³6. Implications and Scholarly PerspectiveThe Quran provides ethical and spiritual guidance but does not consistently align with modern science. Claims of scientific miracles often rely on ambiguous translations or selective examples. Scholars emphasize the importance of distinguishing theological meaning from empirical observation, preserving the integrity of both scripture and science.¹⁴Faith offers guidance on morality, ethics, and purpose, while science investigates natural phenomena through observation and experimentation. Attempting to merge the two without critical analysis risks misinterpretation and intellectual confusion.¹⁵7. ConclusionA critical review shows multiple scientific inaccuracies in the Quran when compared with contemporary knowledge. Many claims of scientific miracles rely on ambiguous language, metaphorical expression, or post hoc analogies. While the Quran remains a profound spiritual text, it cannot reliably serve as a source of scientific authority.True understanding comes from appreciating the Quran’s theological insights while relying on observation, experimentation, and critical thinking to study the natural world. Maintaining this balance preserves intellectual integrity and genuine faith.¹⁶BibliographyQuran Translations:Arberry, Arthur J.The Koran Interpreted.

    "full_content": "Was Allah a “Flat-Earther”? A Scholarly Reflection on Qur’an 15:19 and Ancient CosmologyBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis article critically examines Qur’an 15:19, which states,“And the earth We have spread out, and placed therein firm mountains, and caused to grow therein all things in due proportion.”Classical Islamic exegesis frequently interpreted this verse literally, envisioning the earth as a flat expanse stabilized by mountains. Such interpretations reflect the cosmological assumptions of late antiquity, paralleling Mesopotamian and biblical imagery. However, this worldview is irreconcilable with modern scientific knowledge of a spherical earth governed by gravitational forces. This paper situates Qur’an 15:19 within its exegetical and historical contexts, compares it with neighboring cosmologies, and explores its implications for theology and interpretation.IntroductionQur’an 15:19 reads:“And the earth We have spread out, and placed therein firm mountains, and caused to grow therein all things in due proportion.”The expressionmadadnāhā(“We have spread it out”) has been widely understood by classical exegetes as describing the earth in flat, expansive terms. Such language provokes critical questions regarding the Qur’an’s claim to divine omniscience: is this a phenomenological metaphor, or does it betray the human cultural horizon of its composition?Classical Exegesis and the Flat Earth ConceptionThe major tafsīr authorities consistently interpreted the verse in line with a flat-earth cosmology:Al-Ṭabarī (d. 923):وَالْأَرْضَ مَدَدْنَاهَاأي بسطناها على وجه الماء لتكون فراشاً للخلق.(“And the earth We have spread out” means: We stretched it out over the surface of the water so that it might be a resting place for creation.”)1Al-Qurṭubī (d. 1273):مددناها: أي بسطناها، مثل مد الأديم.(“‘We have spread it out’: that is, We stretched it, like the stretching of a hide.”)2Ibn Kathīr (d. 1373):أي بسطناها وقررناها وثبتناها بالجبال الرواسي.(“That is, We spread it out, established it, and fixed it with firm mountains.”)3Al-Rāzī (d. 1210), in hisMafātīḥ al-Ghayb, acknowledges the plain sense of spreading as expansion but attempts to reconcile the imagery with philosophical reasoning, suggesting that even a spherical earth can be perceived as spread from the human vantage point.4Al-Bayḍāwī (d. 1286)in hisAnwār al-Tanzīlreinforces the traditional reading:مددناها: بسطناها طولاً وعرضاً.(“We spread it out: We extended it in length and breadth.”)5Al-Suyūṭī (d. 1505), inal-Durr al-Manthūr, collects earlier reports affirming that the earth was stretched flat and anchored with mountains, citing early authorities such as Ibn ʿAbbās and Mujāhid.6These authorities show a broad exegetical consensus: the earth was envisioned as a vast, flat expanse, stabilized by mountains.Ancient Cosmology and Human PerceptionThe Qur’anic description mirrors the cosmological framework of the ancient Near East. Mesopotamian cosmology depicted the earth as a flat disc under a solid firmament; biblical texts likewise refer to the “pillars of the earth” (Job 9:6) and its immovable foundations (Psalm 104:5). For seventh-century Arabs, the earth appeared phenomenologically flat, and the Qur’an’s imagery corresponds with this perception.The Conflict with Modern ScienceModern science establishes beyond dispute that the earth is spherical, rotating, and governed by gravity. The Qur’anic notion of a flat, spread-out earth anchored by mountains directly contradicts these findings.Apologists often argue for metaphorical interpretation (earth spread for habitation) or attempt to reconcile the text with geology (mountains as stabilizers of tectonic plates). Yet, these interpretations impose anachronistic readings on the text, obscuring its historical meaning.Theological and Hermeneutical ImplicationsThe exegetical consensus that Qur’an 15:19 describes a flat earth raises theological questions. If the Qur’an is eternal and uncreated, why does it reflect seventh-century cosmology?Two responses are possible:Allegorical Hermeneutics– Reinterpreting cosmological language as metaphorical or symbolic.Historical-Critical Realism– Recognizing the Qur’an as a document embedded in its historical context, reflecting human cultural limitations.The former preserves theological inerrancy; the latter challenges claims of divine omniscience.Comparative Biblical CosmologyThe Bible also reflects pre-scientific cosmology (e.g., Genesis 1:6-8’s firmament). However, Christian theology traditionally interprets such texts metaphorically. By contrast, modern Muslim apologists often insist the Qur’an is scientifically miraculous, leaving less interpretive flexibility.ConclusionQur’an 15:19 reflects the cosmological assumptions of late antiquity, presenting the earth as a flat plain stabilized by mountains. While coherent in its historical context, this imagery is incompatible with modern scientific knowledge. The verse illustrates the challenge of reconciling ancient sacred cosmologies with contemporary understandings of the natural world.ReferencesSecondary WorksWansbrough, J.Quranic Studies: Sources and Methods of Scriptural Interpretation.Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1977.Watt, W.

    "full_content": "The Qur’an: Incomplete Revelation or Twisted Text?By Dr. Maxwell Shimba – Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThe Muslim claim that the Qur’an is the final, perfect, and preserved word of God is central to Islamic theology. Yet when one examines Islamic sources themselves, contradictions and weaknesses emerge that cast doubt on this bold claim. One such troubling reality is that Muhammad himselfforgot verses of the Qur’an—as explicitly recorded inSahih al-Bukhari 5038. If the very recipient of the revelation could forget verses, how can we be confident that nothing essential was lost, altered, or corrupted during transmission?This debate article challenges the authenticity and completeness of the Qur’an by drawing upon both Islamic traditions and logical inquiry, while also asking critical questions that Muslim scholars rarely answer with clarity.The Prophet Who Forgot RevelationAccording toSahih al-Bukhari 5038, Aisha narrates that Muhammad heard a man reciting the Qur’an at night and responded:“May Allah bestow His Mercy on him, as he has reminded me of such-and-such Verses of such-and-such Suras, which I was caused to forget.”This raises fundamental questions:If Muhammad forgot verses until reminded by others, how many verses were permanently lost because nobody reminded him?If God’s word is eternal and perfect, why would the prophet of Islam forget it at all?Was revelation not safeguarded by God?How reliable is the Qur’an if its earliest guardian was a fallible man prone to forgetting the very words he claimed to receive from heaven?Missing Verses and the Doctrine of AbrogationThe problem of missing verses is compounded by the Islamic doctrine ofnaskh(abrogation), where one verse cancels or replaces another. The Qur’an itself admits this phenomenon:“We do not abrogate a verse or cause it to be forgotten except that We bring forth one better than it or similar to it…”(Qur’an 2:106).This verse is alarming:If verses were “caused to be forgotten,” does that not imply the Qur’an is incomplete?If God replaced verses with “better ones,” then were the original verses imperfect?How can Muslims insist on “perfect preservation” when the text itself admits deletion and replacement?The Problem of Multiple CodicesHistorical records affirm that different versions of the Qur’an existed. The most famous example is the collection under Caliph Uthman, whoburned competing manuscriptsto enforce a standardized version. This leads to further troubling questions:What was in the codices that Uthman destroyed?If the Qur’an was perfectly preserved, why was there disagreement among early Muslims about its content?Why do surviving non-Uthmanic readings (e.g., Ibn Mas‘ud’s mushaf without Surah al-Fatiha and Surah al-Falaq/al-Nas) contradict the claim of a uniform Qur’an?Twisted and Contradictory VersesBeyond missing verses, many Qur’anic passages exhibit contradictions and internal inconsistencies:Creation Accounts: Was man created from water (21:30), clay (15:26), dust (3:59), or nothing (19:67)?Alcohol: First permitted (16:67), then discouraged (4:43), and finally forbidden (5:90). Which is God’s eternal word?Peace or Violence?Early Meccan verses preach tolerance (109:6), while later Medinan verses command warfare against unbelievers (9:5). Was God changing His mind, or were the verses tailored for political expedience?These contradictions suggest not a divine book, but a text shaped by changing circumstances, reflecting human adaptation rather than eternal revelation.Scholarly Challenges for MuslimsThe Qur’an’s claim of incorruptibility (Qur’an 15:9) collapses under its own historical and textual weight. Thus, I pose the following academic questions to my Muslim interlocutors:If Muhammad forgot verses, how can Muslims claim perfect preservation?If Uthman destroyed variant manuscripts, how do we know today’s Qur’an reflects the original?If verses were abrogated, why are they still recited in the mushaf if they are no longer valid?If contradictions exist, how can the Qur’an be the flawless word of God?If “Satanic Verses” (referenced in Islamic tradition) infiltrated revelation temporarily, how can Muslims assure us that other satanic intrusions did not survive?ConclusionThe Qur’an presents itself as the uncorrupted, final word of God. Yet its own sources confessforgotten verses, abrogations, destroyed manuscripts, contradictions, and missing content. These are not trivial problems; they strike at the very foundation of Islamic theology. If the transmission of revelation depended on a man who admitted to forgetting verses, and if later caliphs had to enforce a uniform text by fire, then the integrity of the Qur’an cannot be guaranteed.In contrast, the Bible—written by over 40 authors across centuries, cultures, and languages—remains consistent in its core message and has survived the test of history with thousands of manuscripts verifying its content. The Qur’an’s claim of superiority is therefore not only unproven but also deeply flawed.📖By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological Institute",

    "full_content": "God Speaks Through His Son: The Finality of Revelation in ChristBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThe Epistle to the Hebrews affirms the supremacy and finality of divine revelation in Jesus Christ. Hebrews 1:1–2 establishes that while God once communicated through the prophets, His ultimate and decisive Word has come through His Son. This theological declaration directly challenges later claims of revelation through Muhammad, the Qur’an, or any other religious authority. This article argues that Jesus Christ is the seal of revelation, the sole Savior of humanity, and the definitive way to God.IntroductionThe question of divine revelation stands at the heart of theological inquiry. Who speaks for God, and how does God communicate His will to humanity? Hebrews 1:1–2 provides a definitive answer:“God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by His Son, whom He hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also He made the worlds.” (Hebrews 1:1–2, KJV)This passage establishes theeschatological finalityof Christ’s revelation. God once spoke in fragments and shadows through the prophets, but in these last days, His speech is singular, ultimate, and complete in the person of His Son. Any claim to new or subsequent revelation—whether through Muhammad or the Qur’an—stands in contradiction to this apostolic testimony.The Finality of Christ’s RevelationThe New Testament consistently portrays Jesus as theclimactic and definitive revelation of God. The Johannine prologue affirms,“No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has made Him known”(John 1:18). Similarly, Colossians 1:15–17 declares that Christ is the “image of the invisible God,” through whom all things were created.The author of Hebrews emphasizes that Jesus is not simply another prophet in succession but the Son—heir of all things, Creator of the worlds, and sustainer of the universe (Heb. 1:3). The prophets delivered God’s Word; Jesus is God’s Word made flesh (John 1:14). The distinction is absolute: Christ does not merely point to revelation—He is the revelation.The early Church understood this clearly.Irenaeus of Lyons(2nd century) wrote,“In Christ, God has recapitulated all things… for He is Himself the Word of God made flesh”(Against Heresies, III.16.6). This means that nothing beyond Christ is needed, for all revelation converges in Him.Jesus as the Seal of RevelationIslam asserts that Muhammad is the “seal of the prophets” (Qur’an 33:40). Yet Scripture testifies thatJesus Himself is the true seal of divine revelation. Unlike Muhammad, who neither performed miracles to confirm his message nor fulfilled biblical prophecy, Jesus validated His authority through works of divine power: healing the sick, raising the dead, forgiving sins, and ultimately rising from the grave.Athanasiusargued in theOn the Incarnationthat the resurrection of Christ is the ultimate proof of divine truth:“The Word of God took flesh so that He might offer it for all and by rising again abolish death for all.”This victory over death marks Jesus, not Muhammad, as God’s final and decisive messenger.The resurrection is God’s seal upon Christ’s revelation. AsAugustinedeclared,“In the resurrection of our Lord, the faith of the gospel has received its sure foundation”(Sermon 229N). The empty tomb testifies that Christ, not Muhammad, is the living voice of God.Jesus as the Only SaviorThe apostolic kerygma is uncompromising: salvation is found in Christ alone. Acts 4:12 proclaims,“Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.”Jesus Himself declared,“I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me”(John 14:6).This exclusivity is not arrogance but divine necessity. Only the incarnate Son, who is both God and man, can reconcile humanity to the Father. No prophet, angel, or religious leader can accomplish redemption apart from Christ’s atoning death and resurrection.Cyril of Alexandriaemphasized this in his Christological writings:“It was not possible that through another, but only through the Son Himself, reconciliation with the Father should be made.”Jesus as the True ReligionIslam defines itself asdīn(the way, the religion). Yet Christianity proclaims that Jesus Himself is “the Way.” Religion is not found in a system of laws or rituals but in the person of Christ. AsOrigenobserved,“We may call Him our religion, for whatever we do in the service of God is through Him”(Contra Celsum, II.9).Therefore, to follow Jesus is not to follow one religion among many but to embrace the fullness of divine truth. To substitute Muhammad or the Qur’an in His place is to abandon the very revelation of God in these last days.ConclusionHebrews 1:1–2 compels the world to recognize that God has spoken definitively through His Son. Jesus Christ is the final Word, the true seal of revelation, the only Savior, and the living way to the Father. Muhammad, the Qur’an, and Islam offer no new truth but stand in contradiction to God’s completed revelation.The testimony of Scripture and the witness of the Church Fathers are united:listen to Jesus.He is God’s last Word to the world, and in Him alone is eternal life.ReferencesAthanasius.On the Incarnation.Augustine.Sermons.Cyril of Alexandria.On the Unity of Christ.Irenaeus of Lyons.Against Heresies.Origen.Contra Celsum.The Holy Bible, King James Version.",

    "full_content": "The Veiling of Oppression: Women and Structural Misogyny in IslamDr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute, New York, NYAbstractThis article examines the structural and theological underpinnings of women’s subjugation within Islam. Drawing upon primary Islamic texts—the Qur’an and Hadith—it demonstrates how misogynistic attitudes are embedded within the very foundation of the religion. While Muslim women across history and in contemporary societies continue to face oppression justified through these texts, many nevertheless defend such practices as expressions of faith. This paper seeks to highlight the tension between scriptural misogyny and women’s lived realities, arguing that what is often framed as “submission to God” is, in fact, submission to patriarchal structures sanctified through religion.IntroductionThe treatment of women in Islam remains a pressing subject in both academic and interfaith dialogue. While apologists attempt to portray Islam as a liberating force for women, the textual evidence from the Qur’an and Hadith reveals a persistent pattern of misogyny. The Qur’an and the canonical Hadith collections establish frameworks that subordinate women, strip them of agency, and justify violence against them. These prescriptions, rather than isolated aberrations, constitute systemic elements of Islamic theology and praxis.Scriptural Foundations of MisogynyQur’an 4:34: The Divine Mandate of Domestic ViolenceQur’an 4:34 explicitly grants men authority over women, prescribing physical discipline when men “fear disobedience”:“As to those women on whose part ye fear disloyalty and ill-conduct, admonish them, refuse to share their beds, and beat them.”1This verse enshrines the idea of male guardianship (qiwāmah) and legitimizes violence as a divinely sanctioned disciplinary measure. Such a framework reduces women to subordinates under male control.Women as Deficient in Intelligence and ReligionInṢaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī(no. 304), Muhammad declares that women are “deficient in intelligence and religion.”2 This teaching has been used for centuries to justify restrictions on women’s roles in law, education, and leadership. It not only delegitimizes women’s intellectual capacity but also frames their spirituality as inherently inferior.Women as the Majority in HellThe Hadith further depict women as morally and spiritually defective. InṢaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī(no. 1052), Muhammad claims:“I looked into Hell and saw that the majority of its inhabitants were women.”3This portrayal demonizes women collectively, casting them as morally culpable by nature and reinforcing patriarchal suspicion toward female autonomy.Women Equated with Donkeys and DogsInṢaḥīḥ Muslim(no. 2742), Muhammad asserts that a woman, like a dog or a donkey, can nullify a man’s prayer if she passes in front of him.4 Such a statement not only dehumanizes women but situates them among animals considered ritually disruptive, underscoring their perceived impurity in the religious imagination of Islam.Sociological Implications: Misogyny as Sacred NormThese textual examples illustrate that misogyny is not incidental but structural within Islam. The Qur’an and Hadith provide theological scaffolding for patriarchal domination, which is then codified into Islamic jurisprudence (sharī‘ah). The result is a religious system that normalizes female subjugation, while socializing women themselves into defending this oppression under the guise of faith.The Tragedy of Internalized OppressionOne of the most striking features of this dynamic is the internalization of subjugation by Muslim women themselves. As Leila Ahmed notes, Islamic gender norms create a “paradox of liberation and subjugation” where women may defend their very chains as symbols of piety.5 Submission is recast as virtue, and questioning oppression is framed as impiety. This internalization explains why many Muslim women continue to embrace practices that curtail their freedom, seeing them not as imposed restrictions but as divine mandates.ConclusionThe evidence demonstrates that the subjugation of women in Islam is not merely a cultural artifact but a doctrinal reality rooted in foundational texts. The Qur’an and Hadith establish a pattern of misogyny that has shaped Muslim societies for centuries. While contemporary voices seek to reinterpret or mitigate these texts, the underlying problem remains: Islam was built upon the anxieties of a man who feared women’s independence, intelligence, and equality, and who cloaked his personal biases in divine authority. The tragedy is that generations of women have embraced these biases as faith, mistaking oppression for devotion and submission for spiritual virtue.ReferencesQur’an 4:34, translation by Abdullah Yusuf Ali.Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī, Book 6, Hadith 304.Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī, Book 29, Hadith 1052.Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim, Book 4, Hadith 2742.Ahmed, Leila.Women and Gender in Islam: Historical Roots of a Modern Debate.

One of the primary verses used to support this view isSurah 4:82:“Do they not then consider the Qur'an carefully? Had it been from other than Allah, they would surely have found therein much contradiction.”(Surah 4:82)This verse offers a built-in falsification test:if contradictions are found, then the Qur’an cannot be from Allah.This paper critically engages with this claim by examining internal textual tension inSurah 4, specifically verses78 and 79, which appear to provide mutually exclusive statements regarding the origin of evil. We assess whether these verses pass the Qur’an’s own test of divine consistency.Textual Analysis of Surah 4:78–79Verse 78: Evil Comes from Allah“Wherever you may be, death will overtake you, even if you are in lofty towers. If some good befalls them, they say, ‘This is from Allah,’ but if evil befalls them, they say, ‘This is from you (O Prophet).’ Say: All things are from Allah...”(Surah 4:78)Here, the Qur’an affirmsdivine sovereignty over all occurrences, both good and evil, correcting the notion that the Prophet Muhammad could be blamed for calamities. The verse unequivocally states,“All things are from Allah,”which includes good and evil.Verse 79: Evil Comes from the Human Soul“Whatever good happens to you is from Allah, but whatever evil happens to you is from your own soul (nafs)...”(Surah 4:79)In direct succession, the Qur’an shifts focus, suggesting amoral responsibility frameworkin which evil results from human actions or choices. The implication is that evil originatesnot from Allah, but from the individual.Apparent Contradiction: A Logical BreakdownVerseStatementSource of EvilSurah 4:78\"All things are from Allah\"Evil comes from AllahSurah 4:79\"Evil is from your own soul\"Evil comes from manThisjuxtapositionof statements—one attributing all occurrences (including evil) to Allah, and the other attributing evil to the individual—presents a cleartextual tension. It is particularly striking that these verses are consecutive, intensifying the charge of inconsistency.Exegetical Attempts by Muslim ScholarsIslamic scholars have long tried to reconcile this apparent contradiction throughtafsir(Qur’anic interpretation). The general apologetic approach claims:Verse 78refers toGod's decree (qadar)—that Allah allows or wills events to occur, including evil.Verse 79refers to themoral culpabilityof humans—suggesting that evil originates in human free will or sin, even if God permits it.However, this attempt to harmonize the versesfails to address the explicit language. The phrase\"all things are from Allah\"leaves little room for distinguishing between passive permission and active authorship. If evil is ultimately willed or decreed by Allah, then the moral responsibility of man becomes secondary to divine authorship—contradicting the clear wording of verse 79.Qur’an’s Own Standard InvalidatedBy invoking Surah 4:82, the Qur’an invites scrutiny. Ifinternal contradictionsare a test for divine authenticity, then the discrepancy betweenSurah 4:78and4:79is disqualifying. These verses represent:Philosophical inconsistencyon the origin of evil.Logical contradictionregarding divine and human responsibility.Theological incoherencein reconciling God’s sovereignty with human accountability.Thus, the Qur’anfails its own testof divine origin. A perfect and omniscient God would not inspire such tension within two consecutive verses in a single chapter.Conclusion: Self-Refutation of Divine Origin ClaimThe Qur’an’s claim to divine origin is based heavily on its alleged internal consistency. Yet, when the text of Surah 4 is subjected to critical and honest examination, it fails the very standard it sets.The contradiction between verse 78 and verse 79is not semantic, poetic, or interpretive—it isexplicit, direct, and irreconcilable without resorting to theological gymnastics.This leads to the logical conclusion that the Qur’an bears themarks of fallible human authorshiprather than divine revelation. A book from God would not contradict itself, especially not in back-to-back verses within the same surah. The claim that “there is no discrepancy in the Qur’an” thus becomesnot only unproven—but self-refuted.Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

    "full_content": "Is the Qur’an Allah?Eternity, Createdness, and the Problem of Monotheism in Islamic TheologyBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteAbstractOne of the most persistent and unresolved theological tensions within Islam concerns the nature of the Qur'an. Classical Islamic theology is divided over whether the Qur’an iscreatedoruncreated. This article argues that both positions generate serious philosophical and theological problems for Islamic monotheism (tawḥīd). If the Qur’an is created, it cannot be the eternal speech of Allah. If it is uncreated and eternal, then Islam appears to affirmtwo eternal realities, raising fundamental questions about whether Islam consistently maintains monotheism while simultaneously rejecting the Christian doctrine of the Trinity.1. The Central Question: What Is the Qur’an?Islam universally affirms that the Qur’an is thekalām Allāh—the speech of Allah. However, Islamic theology has never reached consensus onhowthis speech exists in relation to Allah Himself. The dilemma can be framed simply:Is the Qur’ancreated in time, orIs the Qur’anuncreated and eternal?This question is not peripheral. It strikes at the heart of divine ontology, revelation, and the coherence of Islamic monotheism.2. The Created Qur’an: A Finite Revelation?TheMuʿtaziliteschool famously argued that the Qur’an iscreated. Their motivation was to preserve absolute divine unity and avoid positing anything eternal alongside Allah.However, this position generates severe consequences:Denial of Eternal SpeechIf the Qur’an is created, then Allah’s speech is not eternal. This implies that Allah was oncewithoutspeech, contradicting the Islamic claim that divine attributes are eternal.Undermining Divine PerfectionSpeech is not an accidental attribute but an essential expression of intellect and will. A God who acquires speech in time is, by definition, mutable—an attribute incompatible with classical theism.Theological InstabilityIf the Qur’an is created, then it becomes a contingent object, subject to historical conditions. This weakens claims of its absolute, timeless authority.Thus, in attempting to protect monotheism, the “created Qur’an” position undermines divine immutability and perfection.3. The Uncreated Qur’an: Two Eternals?The dominantSunniposition holds that the Qur’an isuncreated, eternal, and subsisting with Allah. This view avoids the problems of mutability but introduces a far deeper contradiction.If the Qur’an is:EternalUncreatedDistinct from creationthen the following dilemma arises:Is the Qur’an identical to Allah, or distinct from Allah?3.1 If Identical to AllahIf the Qur’anisAllah, then Muslims effectively identify abook, words, sounds, and letterswith God Himself. This is theologically incoherent and borders on bibliolatry.3.2 If Distinct from AllahIf the Qur’an isnot Allah, yet eternal and uncreated, then Islam affirmstwo eternal realities:AllahThe Qur’anThis violates the very principle oftawḥīdIslam claims to defend. Monotheism, by definition, does not permit multiple uncreated eternals.4. The Trinity Objection ReconsideredIslam frequently rejects the Christian Trinity on the grounds that it compromises divine unity. Yet Christianity doesnotteach three gods, but one God with eternally existing personal distinctions.Ironically, classical Sunni Islam affirms:One God (Allah)An uncreated, eternal speech (the Qur’an)Multiple eternal divine attributes without personal distinctionThe question then becomes unavoidable:How can Islam accuse Christianity of polytheism while affirming an eternal reality alongside Allah that is not Allah?At minimum, Islam faces the same metaphysical complexity it condemns—without the philosophical clarity Christianity provides through Trinitarian ontology.5. Philosophical ImplicationsFrom a philosophical standpoint, Islam is caught in a false dilemma:Created Qur’an→ God is mutable and not eternally speakingUncreated Qur’an→ Two eternals, undermining monotheismBoth options compromise either:Divine perfection, orDivine unityThere is no third coherent alternative within Islamic theology.6. ConclusionThe question“Is the Qur’an Allah?”is not rhetorical—it is unavoidable. Islamic theology cannot coherently maintain that the Qur’an is eternal, uncreated, and yet not divine without collapsing into contradiction.Thus, Islam faces a fundamental challenge:How can Islam consistently claim monotheism if both Allah and the Qur’an are eternal and uncreated?Until this dilemma is resolved, Islamic claims of theological simplicity and superior monotheism remain philosophically and logically unsubstantiated.Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

Is this a miracle or a lack of knowledge in basic physics?To understand what happened regarding the non-mixing of waters, it is good to first learn Fourth Grade Physics about Density.ALLAH in the Qur’an, Surah 18 verses 60 to 82:“And remember when Musa said to his servant: I will continue travelling until I reach the junction of the two seas, or I will continue for ages and ages until I meet the one whom I seek.”So, when Muslims saw a picture of two seas (their claim), they connected it with this verse as a miracle of Allah. Fortunately, here at Max Shimba Ministries, we have scholars who are experts in Science, Mathematics, and Biology. Therefore today we respond to Muslims using science.Let us begin with the principle of Density:WHAT IS DENSITY?DENSITY = MASS / VOLUMEDensity is a measure that compares the mass and volume of a substance. Its physical symbol is ρ (rho).A substance with high density contains a lot of matter within a specific volume. A substance with low density contains little matter within the same volume. High density is what makes us call something “heavy.”Density is commonly measured in g/cm³ and kg/m³.Using logic:Fresh water without salt has a density of 1. One liter has a mass of 1 kilogram.WHAT IS MASS?Mass in physics is a property of matter, and thus also the property of an object or substance.The standard international unit of mass is the kilogram. Its usual formula symbol ism.WHAT IS VOLUME?Volume explains the size of a mathematical object (cube, sphere, cylinder) by measuring the space it occupies.It is measured in cubic units such as cubic meters (m³) or cubic centimeters (cm³).Every object with length, width, and height has volume.SALT WATER:Salt water is water containing a certain amount of dissolved salt. All types of natural water contain some amount of dissolved salts.On average, seawater on earth contains about 3.5% salt (35 g/L, 599 mM). This means that every kilogram (roughly one liter plus a little) of seawater has about 35 grams (1.2 oz) of dissolved salts (mostly sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl–) ions). The average surface density is 1.025 kg/L.Seawater is denser/heavier than fresh water because dissolved salts greatly increase mass. The freezing point of seawater decreases as salinity increases. At normal salinity, it freezes at –2°C (28°F). The coldest liquid seawater recorded in 2010, under an Antarctic glacier, measured –2.6°C (27.3°F). Seawater pH is usually between 7.5 and 8.4. However, no universally accepted pH standard exists for seawater, and different reference scales can differ by up to 0.14 units.FRESH WATER:Fresh water is water without much salt.Rainwater, river water, and lake water are called “fresh water,” meaning they are basically suitable for drinking or watering plants even though they may contain some mud or impurities. The opposite is salt water found in oceans and some lakes.Scientifically, water is considered “fresh” when its salt concentration is less than 1% or one gram per liter. Most fresh water on Earth is snow and ice—frozen precipitation formed in cold climates.NOW I WILL EXPLAIN IN SIMPLE LANGUAGE SO EVERYONE CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THESE WATERS DO NOT MIX QUICKLY.First, understand this:Two seas are NOT meeting.This Muslim claim is false and based on lack of knowledge. The picture being used is the meeting ofglacial meltwaterandoffshore watersof the Gulf of Alaska.The cause of this strange phenomenon is thedifference in water density, water temperature, and salt content between glacial meltwater and the waters of the Gulf of Alaska. They fail to mix because of their density differences.Seawater has a salt concentration of 3.5%. Scientists often refer to 0.1% as fresh water.Because both types of water are very cold in temperature, the mixing process takes time.A solution is the result of completely mixing two substances to obtain a uniform mixture that does not show separate parts. A SIMPLE EXAMPLE: stirring sugar into water. The sugar becomes invisible once fully dissolved. If the water is cold, sugar takes much longer to dissolve compared to warm or hot water.This is exactly what happens in the Gulf of Alaska, where all the water is cold and the glacial meltwater, which has very little salt, takes a very long time to mix with the Gulf waters, which have salt levels up to 3.5%.Is this a miracle or just normal science?This is why I continue to sayAllah is not God.Shalom,Dr. Max Shimba, servant of Jesus Christ the Great God.Titus 2:13",

The Qur’an describes Muhammad’s wives as the“Mothers of the Believers”(Surah al-Ahzab 33:6), yet in the same chapter (33:40), it explicitly declares that Muhammad is“not the father of any of your men.”This raises critical theological, logical, and ethical questions about the nature of Muhammad’s paternal status in Islam and the prohibition against remarriage of his widows. This paper seeks to analyze this doctrinal inconsistency through historical, linguistic, and theological perspectives, and to question the coherence of the Qur’anic reasoning in relation to social and moral norms.1. IntroductionThe Qur’an presents Muhammad as both theMessenger of AllahandSeal of the Prophets(Qur’an 33:40). However, it simultaneously establishes a peculiar familial relationship between Muhammad and his followers. His wives are declared the“Mothers of the Believers”(33:6), while Muhammad himself is emphatically denied any paternal role toward his male followers. This duality gives rise to a complex paradox: how can one’s wives bemotherswhile the husband isnot a father?The contradiction becomes more pronounced in light of Islamic marital law, which forbids any man from marrying the Prophet’s widows, invoking their “maternal” status to the Muslim community. Yet, logically, if Muhammad is not a father to any believer, the justification for this prohibition becomes unclear.2. The Qur’anic Framework2.1. The Denial of Fatherhood (Qur’an 33:40)“Muḥammad is not the father of any of your men, but the Messenger of Allah and the Seal of the Prophets.”This verse was reportedly revealed in response to the controversy surrounding Zayd ibn Harithah, Muhammad’s adopted son. When Muhammad married Zayd’s former wife, Zaynab bint Jahsh, the Qur’an redefined adoption laws, annulling adopted sonship and, consequently, Muhammad’s legal fatherhood over Zayd (see Tafsir al-Tabari,Jami’ al-Bayan, vol. 22). Thus, the verse served to deny Muhammad any human fatherhood over the believers, preserving his prophetic status from personal familial association.2.2. The Declaration of Spiritual Maternity (Qur’an 33:6)“The Prophet is closer to the believers than their own selves, and his wives are their mothers.”This verse confers a unique symbolic status on Muhammad’s wives, elevating them above ordinary women. However, the text does not clarify the logical basis for this designation nor its theological implications, especially since it does not confer corresponding paternal authority upon Muhammad himself.3. The Logical InconsistencyThe two verses (33:6 and 33:40) produce a theological dilemma:If Muhammad’s wives aremothersof the believers, then Muhammad logically ought to be thefatherof the believers.If Muhammad isnot a fatherof any of the believers, then his wives cannot logically bemothersof the believers.Islamic apologists argue that “motherhood” in 33:6 is spiritual, not biological. Yet, the same principle could apply to Muhammad’s “fatherhood” — spiritual rather than physical. The deliberate exclusion of Muhammad’s paternal role seems inconsistent with the spiritual analogy intended by the verse.4. The Ethical Question: Prohibition of RemarriageAfter Muhammad’s death, the Qur’an prohibited his widows from remarrying (Qur’an 33:53):“And it is not lawful for you to harm the Messenger of Allah, nor to marry his wives after him ever. Indeed, that would be an enormity in the sight of Allah.”This restriction is justified by their “maternal” status — yet the argument collapses under scrutiny.If the Prophet’s wives were “mothers” only in a symbolic sense, why should they be denied remarriage — a right granted to all other widows in Islam (Qur’an 2:234–235)?Moreover, if Muhammad is not the “father” of the believers, then his widows cannot truly be “mothers” to them, and the prohibition becomes legally and ethically questionable.5. Historical Context: Muhammad’s MarriagesMuhammad’s marriages included several widows, such as Sawdah bint Zam’ah, Hafsah bint Umar, and Umm Salamah. These marriages were often justified as acts of social welfare. Yet the same compassion was not extended to his own widows, who were condemned to lifelong celibacy. The question arises: if Muhammad could marry widows for their protection, why could not others protect and marry his widows after his death?The inconsistency suggests that the prohibition was politically and socially motivated to preserve the Prophet’s exclusive legacy and to prevent disputes over lineage or inheritance within the early Muslim community.6. Theological ImplicationsFrom a theological standpoint, Islam presents Muhammad as the“Seal of the Prophets”— the final messenger and ultimate exemplar. Yet the Qur’an strips him of spiritual fatherhood, creating a vacuum in the believer’s personal relationship to him. Christianity, by contrast, recognizes both paternal and fraternal spiritual relationships in divine-human dynamics (cf. 1 Corinthians 4:15, Philippians 2:22).In Islam, however, Muhammad’s detachment as “not the father” while his wives remain “mothers” results in a doctrinal asymmetry — a partial metaphor that fails to maintain theological coherence.7. ConclusionThe Qur’an’s portrayal of Muhammad’s family relationships reveals a deep inconsistency within Islamic theology.If Muhammad is not the father of any believer, then his wives cannot logically be the believers’ mothers.If his wives are indeed the “Mothers of the Believers,” then a corresponding paternal role must exist — at least symbolically.The prohibition on the remarriage of Muhammad’s widows, coupled with his own marriages to other widows, further exposes the internal contradictions within Islamic social ethics.This paradox demonstrates that the Qur’anic narrative on Muhammad’s familial relations is less theological and more political — crafted to preserve Muhammad’s exclusive prophetic authority rather than to maintain logical or moral consistency.ReferencesThe Qur’an, Surah al-Ahzab (33:6, 33:40, 33:53).Al-Tabari,Jami’ al-Bayan fi Ta’wil al-Qur’an, Vol. 22.Ibn Kathir,Tafsir al-Qur’an al-‘Azim, commentary on Surah al-Ahzab.Al-Qurtubi,Al-Jami’ li-Ahkam al-Qur’an, commentary on 33:6 and 33:40.Sahih al-Bukhari, Hadith 4787 – Narration on Zayd ibn Harithah and Zaynab bint Jahsh.Watt, W.

    "full_content": "Shimba Theological Institute NewsletterComparative Reflections on Moral Leadership: Michael Jackson and MuhammadBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaAbstract:This article undertakes a comparative moral and ethical analysis of Michael Jackson and the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), focusing on their respective interactions with children, philanthropy, and societal influence. While acknowledging controversies surrounding both figures, the analysis examines documented behavior, legal findings, and historical practices to assess their impact on societal norms, particularly regarding children’s welfare and moral example.Introduction:In contemporary moral discourse, public figures are often scrutinized as role models. Michael Jackson, the globally renowned entertainer, and the Prophet Muhammad, the founder of Islam, provide distinct examples of leadership, influence, and societal impact. This study examines their respective approaches to children’s welfare, charity, music, and ethical conduct.Michael Jackson: Legal Vindication and PhilanthropyMichael Jackson’s public life was marked by extraordinary musical talent and widespread humanitarian efforts. While he faced allegations of child abuse, court proceedings ultimately found him not guilty. Jackson consistently expressed personal anguish over these accusations, demonstrating moral sensitivity and the capacity for ethical reflection. Beyond legal vindication, Jackson dedicated significant resources to charitable causes, including children’s hospitals, education, and disaster relief. His public persona emphasized joy, inclusivity, and the protection of children, reflecting a deliberate moral and philanthropic commitment.Muhammad: Historical Practices and Ethical ImplicationsHistorical records indicate that Muhammad engaged in practices, such as early-age marriage, which contemporary ethical frameworks consider morally problematic. Additionally, certain policies, including limitations on adoption and music, had broad societal consequences. While these actions must be understood within their historical and cultural context, they present ethical questions when considering Muhammad as a moral exemplar for modern audiences, particularly in comparison to contemporary standards of children’s welfare and women’s rights. Reports also indicate practices involving surveillance of private matters, raising further ethical considerations regarding privacy and interpersonal conduct.Comparative Moral AssessmentWhen comparing Jackson and Muhammad, several distinctions emerge:Children’s Welfare:Jackson’s legal vindication and philanthropic focus demonstrate an emphasis on children’s well-being. Historical records of Muhammad suggest practices that today may be viewed as compromising the autonomy and rights of minors.Philanthropy vs. Social Regulation:Jackson utilized personal wealth to enhance societal welfare, while Muhammad’s governance introduced regulatory frameworks with complex moral implications, some of which curtailed individual freedoms.Cultural Impact:Jackson’s music and persona propagated joy, inclusivity, and positive social engagement, whereas Muhammad’s leadership involved military campaigns and social regulation that imposed both security and restrictions on communities.Conclusion:This comparative analysis highlights divergent approaches to moral leadership and societal impact. While Michael Jackson’s life demonstrates a consistent orientation toward child welfare, philanthropy, and joy, Muhammad’s historical record reflects practices that, although influential in shaping Islamic civilization, raise contemporary ethical questions regarding children’s rights, women’s privacy, and social regulation. Evaluating role models in a modern context necessitates careful consideration of both historical practices and current ethical standards, particularly concerning the protection and well-being of vulnerable populations.References:Jackson, M.HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I.

    "full_content": "Shimba Theological Institute – Scholarly Newsletter**Moral Leadership, Children, and Ethical Legacy:A Comparative Ethical Analysis of Michael Jackson and Muhammad**Author:Dr. Maxwell ShimbaInstitution:Shimba Theological InstituteDiscipline:Comparative Theology, Moral Philosophy, Religious EthicsAbstractThis article presents a comparative ethical analysis of two globally influential figures: Michael Jackson and Muhammad. While occupying vastly different domains—entertainment and religion—both figures have been presented to the public as moral exemplars within their respective cultural frameworks. This study evaluates their legacies through four ethical lenses: treatment of children, legal accountability, social impact, and moral conscience. By examining historical sources, legal records, and ethical outcomes, the article argues that moral authority must be evaluated not by popularity or claims of divine mandate, but by demonstrable ethical consistency and protection of vulnerable populations.1. Introduction: The Question of Moral ExemplarsReligious and cultural traditions often elevate individuals as moral models for future generations. In Islam, Muhammad is explicitly presented asal-insān al-kāmil(the perfect man), whose conduct (sunnah) is binding for all times. In contrast, Michael Jackson never claimed moral perfection nor divine authority; nevertheless, he exercised immense cultural influence.This article asks a critical but necessary question:When evaluated by universal ethical standards—especially concerning children and the vulnerable—who better exemplifies moral leadership?2. Michael Jackson: Legal Accountability and Moral SensitivityMichael Jackson faced severe accusations of child abuse—among the most damaging allegations possible for a public figure. Crucially, however, his case was adjudicated within a modern legal system governed by evidentiary standards, cross-examination, and due process.In2005, Jackson wasfound not guilty on all chargesin a criminal court of law. This verdict followed months of scrutiny, testimony, and forensic examination. The outcome is ethically significant: moral accountability requires openness to investigation, not immunity from critique.Equally important is Jackson’spsychological and moral responseto the accusations. Multiple interviews, writings, and testimonies reveal profound emotional distress, grief, and reputational anguish—responses consistent with a functioning moral conscience. He did not normalize the accusations, justify them, or transform them into social norms.Beyond legal matters, Jackson donatedhundreds of millions of dollarsto children’s hospitals, humanitarian organizations, disaster relief efforts, and global charities. His public mission emphasized joy, peace, racial unity, and the emotional well-being of children.3. Muhammad: Historical Practices and Ethical TensionsIslamic primary sources—includingSahih Hadith collections—affirm that Muhammad married Aisha when she was a child and consummated the marriage when she was approximately nine years old. Unlike Jackson, Muhammad facedno legal challenge, expressedno moral hesitation, and instead established this practice asnormative, later sanctified through religious jurisprudence.The ethical problem is not merely historical butsystemic: child marriage became embedded within Islamic law, practiced for centuries, and justified by appeal to Muhammad’s example. Unlike contested allegations, this practice iscelebrated, not repudiated, within orthodox Islamic theology.Additionally, Muhammad instituted legal reforms that:Abolished biological adoption while retaining control over orphansRestricted artistic expression, including musicIntroduced wartime practices that included enslavement and sexual access to captivesWhile apologists frequently invoke “historical context,” moral exemplars—especially those claimed to be timeless—must transcend their era, not merely reflect it.4. Children, Consent, and Ethical UniversalityFrom a moral philosophy standpoint, children represent a non-negotiable ethical boundary. Modern ethics, natural law theory, and biblical theology converge on one principle:children lack the capacity for informed consent and therefore require maximal protection.Michael Jackson, despite allegations,never institutionalized harm, never codified abuse, and never claimed divine sanction for questionable behavior. His legal exoneration and philanthropic record reinforce this distinction.Muhammad, by contrast, embedded child marriage into religious precedent. The result is not theoretical but observable: ongoing cases across multiple Islamic societies where child marriage persists with religious justification.A moral system that cannot safeguard children fails the most basic ethical test.5. Women, Privacy, and Moral AgencyEthical leadership also requires respect for personal dignity and privacy. Islamic texts include accounts of Muhammad surveilling or regulating private marital affairs, reinforcing a patriarchal structure with limited female autonomy.Michael Jackson, despite intense scrutiny of his private life, did not legislate sexual ethics for society, nor did he impose surveillance-based moral control. His influence remained cultural, not coercive.6. Power, Violence, and Social ConsequencesJackson’s influence operated through persuasion, art, and charity. His legacy—music, humanitarian aid, and global unity—did not involve conquest or coercion.Muhammad’s leadership included military expansion, political domination, and religious enforcement. While these actions produced a civilization, they also normalized violence as a tool of religious propagation—a legacy still visible in contemporary extremist movements.7. Ethical Comparison SummaryEthical CriterionMichael JacksonMuhammadLegal AccountabilitySubjected to trial; acquittedAbove legal scrutinyChild ProtectionPublic advocacy, charityChild marriage normalizedMoral ConscienceExpressed anguish and griefPractices justified as divineSocial InfluenceJoy, peace, artRegulation, conquestTimeless EthicsAligns with modern moral normsConflicts with modern ethics8. Conclusion: Rethinking Moral AuthorityThis study does not argue that Michael Jackson was flawless, nor that historical figures should be judged frivolously. Rather, it asserts a foundational ethical principle:No individual—religious or secular—should be upheld as a moral exemplar if their legacy institutionalizes harm to children or strips vulnerable populations of dignity.Michael Jackson, though imperfect, demonstrated accountability, remorse, and a consistent commitment to human flourishing. Muhammad, by contrast, established precedents that continue to generate profound ethical conflicts in the modern world.The question is not popularity or tradition—but moral fruit.References (Selected)California v.

    "full_content": "The Issue of Slavery in the Life of Prophet Muhammad: A Critical ExaminationBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractSlavery remains one of the most debated aspects of human history, particularly when examining religious figures and their conduct. Prophet Muhammad (c. 570–632 CE), the founder of Islam, is often portrayed as a reformer and moral guide. Yet, historical Islamic sources document that he owned and transacted in slaves. This article critically examines the narratives surrounding Muhammad’s engagement with slavery, questions whether such actions are inherently tied to his prophethood, and compares his practices with those of previous prophets.IntroductionThe institution of slavery was widespread in Arabia prior to the advent of Islam. Within Islamic texts, multiple references indicate the possession and trade of slaves, including in the biography of Prophet Muhammad. One particular hadith, narrated inSunan an-Nasa'i(4621), recounts the following incident:\"A slave came and gave his pledge to the Messenger of Allah to emigrate, and the Prophet did not realize that he was a slave. Then his master came looking for him. The Prophet said: 'Sell him to me.' So he bought him for two black slaves, then he did not accept until he had asked: 'Is he a slave?'\" (Sunan an-Nasa'i, Vol. 5, Book 44, Hadith 4625, Sahih).This account demonstrates that Muhammad participated in the acquisition of slaves and indicates that slave ownership occurred even during the early Islamic community.Slavery and Prophethood: A Theological QuestionA critical question arises: does the act of owning slaves align with the mission of prophethood? Prophets in Abrahamic traditions are typically associated with moral reform, justice, and the protection of human dignity. The Hebrew Bible and Christian scriptures do not record prophets personally owning slaves as part of their ministry. For example, Moses, David, and Jesus are portrayed as advocating justice and righteousness rather than engaging in slavery as proprietors.Muhammad’s engagement with slavery raises a theological and ethical concern: if prophethood is meant to guide humanity toward righteousness, how do we reconcile ownership of slaves with the ideals of justice and liberation? While Islamic scholars argue that Muhammad sought to regulate and humanize slavery, critics assert that this does not negate the moral responsibility inherent in owning and trading human beings.Historical Context and Cultural PracticesIt is crucial to situate these actions within the historical context of 7th-century Arabia. Slavery was a norm in pre-Islamic Arabia, encompassing captives of war, debtors, and inherited slaves. Muhammad’s interactions with slavery often involved emancipating slaves, regulating treatment, and advocating for gradual societal reforms. However, ownership and transactions—such as purchasing a slave for other slaves—persisted. The question remains whether cultural practices justify actions that appear ethically incompatible with prophetic morality.Comparison with Other ProphetsExamining other prophets offers an important contrast. No other Abrahamic prophet is recorded as owning slaves for personal or religious purposes. Moses led the Israelites out of bondage, Isaiah and Jeremiah denounced social injustice, and Jesus emphasized love, equality, and liberation from oppression. This contrast highlights a unique aspect of Muhammad’s biography: his prophethood is intertwined with existing socio-economic norms that included slavery.Ethical and Scholarly ImplicationsModern scholars and theologians face a complex dilemma. On one hand, Muhammad’s actions are historically documented within authentic Islamic sources. On the other, these actions challenge contemporary ethical standards, raising questions about the nature of prophethood, divine guidance, and cultural accommodation. A critical examination suggests that while Muhammad may have sought reform, his participation in slavery does not align seamlessly with the moral example set by earlier prophets.ConclusionThe documentation of Prophet Muhammad’s ownership of slaves, such as the incident narrated inSunan an-Nasa'i4621, invites rigorous scholarly scrutiny. While historical context partially explains these actions, they raise important theological and ethical questions regarding the role of a prophet in advancing justice and human dignity. Unlike other prophets, Muhammad’s biography includes participation in slavery, which necessitates critical engagement from scholars and believers seeking to reconcile historical practice with spiritual ideals.Referencesal-Nasa'i, Ahmad ibn Shu'ayb.Sunan an-Nasa'i.

This article critically examines the institution of slavery as practiced and sanctioned by Muhammad, with particular focus on authenticated hadith literature. UsingSunan an-Nasa’i4621 as a primary case study, the article interrogates whether slave ownership and trade can be reconciled with genuine prophethood. A comparative analysis with biblical prophets is undertaken, revealing a significant theological discontinuity. The study concludes that Muhammad’s participation in slavery reflects cultural accommodation rather than transcendent moral reform, raising serious questions about the nature and scope of his prophetic claim.1. Introduction: Prophethood and Moral AuthorityIn the Judeo-Christian tradition, prophets are understood as moral revolutionaries—divinely commissioned figures who confront injustice, liberate the oppressed, and elevate ethical standards beyond cultural norms. From Moses confronting Pharaoh to Jesus identifying himself with the poor and enslaved, prophetic identity is inseparable from moral transcendence.Islamic theology similarly asserts that Muhammad isal-insān al-kāmil(the perfect man) anduswatun ḥasanah(the best example for humanity). Consequently, his personal conduct is not merely historical but normative and imitable. This raises a crucial question:Can participation in slavery—buying, owning, and exchanging human beings—be harmonized with the moral expectations of prophethood?2. Primary Source Evidence: Sunan an-Nasa’i 4621One of the clearest and most troubling accounts is found inSunan an-Nasa’i, gradedṢaḥīḥ (authentic):“A slave came and pledged allegiance to the Messenger of Allah to emigrate, and the Prophet did not realize that he was a slave. Then his master came looking for him. The Prophet said: ‘Sell him to me.’ So he bought him for two black slaves…”—Sunan an-Nasa’i4621This narration establishes several uncontested facts:Muhammadapproved the return of an escaped slaveto his master.Hepurchased the slave, legitimizing the transaction.The purchase involvedexchanging two slaves for one, treating human beings as economic units.The transaction occurredduring Muhammad’s prophetic ministry, not before it.This was not an isolated incident but part of a broader, well-documented pattern.3. Slavery as a Normalized Institution in IslamIslamic primary sources consistently assume the legitimacy of slavery:Qur’an 4:24; 23:5–6; 33:50 explicitly permit sexual access to “those whom your right hand possesses.”Hadith literature records Muhammad owning slaves such as Zayd ibn Harithah, Maria al-Qibtiyya, and others.Slavery is regulated butnever abolishedin the Qur’an.The argument that Islam “encouraged manumission” does not negate the fact that:What God truly condemns, He abolishes—not merely regulates.Alcohol, idolatry, and pork were eliminated decisively. Slavery was not.4. Was This Part of Prophethood—or Cultural Accommodation?Muslim apologists often argue that Muhammad worked within the socio-economic realities of 7th-century Arabia. However, this defense creates a theological dilemma:If Muhammad merely reflected his culture, then his moral authority ishistorically contingent, not divinely absolute.If his actions are divinely sanctioned, thenslavery becomes theologically legitimized.Either conclusion undermines the claim of universal moral prophethood.True prophets do not merelymanageinjustice; theyconfrontit.5. Comparative Prophetic Analysis: Where Are the Other Slave-Holding Prophets?A comparative examination is revealing:MosesRaised in a slave empire.Led thelargest emancipation event in biblical history(Exodus).Never portrayed as owning slaves.Isaiah, Jeremiah, AmosCondemned exploitation, oppression, and dehumanization.Identified injustice as sin against God.Jesus ChristIdentified with slaves and the oppressed (Luke 4:18).Declared radical human equality (Matthew 23:8).Never owned, bought, sold, or exchanged slaves.The biblical prophetic tradition movesaway from slavery, not toward its regulation.Muhammad stands alone among major prophetic claimants inpersonally participating in slave transactions during his ministry.6. Ethical Tension: Human Dignity vs. Property StatusSlavery reduces a person fromimago Dei(image of God) tocommercial property. The hadith inSunan an-Nasa’i4621 explicitly demonstrates this reduction:A man seeking spiritual allegiance is overridden byproperty rights.His spiritual commitment is subordinated toownership claims.His value is measured inexchange units(“two black slaves”).This raises an unavoidable ethical question:Can a prophet who embodies divine justice treat a human soul as transferable property?7. The Problem of Imitability (Uswah)Islamic theology insists that Muhammad is themodel for all believers, for all time(Qur’an 33:21). This creates a lasting moral problem:If Muhammad owned slaves, then slavery cannot be intrinsically immoral in Islam.If slavery is immoral today, then Muhammad’s actions cannot be universally exemplary.This tension has no coherent theological resolution within orthodox Islam.8. The Silence of Allah on AbolitionOne of the most striking features of Islamic revelation is what itdoes notsay:No verse abolishes slavery.No verse declares slave ownership sinful.No verse commands universal emancipation.After Muhammad’s death, Allah issuesno further moral correction. Slavery continued for over 1,300 years in Islamic societies, often justified directly by Muhammad’s example.9. Scholarly and Theological ImplicationsThis analysis does not rest on polemics but onIslam’s own authenticated sources. The issue is not whether slavery existed historically—it did everywhere—but whether a true prophet:Participates in it,Sanctifies it,Leaves it intact for future generations.From a Judeo-Christian theological perspective, the answer is decisivelyno.10. ConclusionThe hadith ofSunan an-Nasa’i4621 presents an unavoidable historical and ethical reality: Muhammad engaged in the ownership and exchange of slaves during his prophetic ministry. This conduct stands in stark contrast to the moral trajectory of biblical prophethood, which consistently moves toward liberation, dignity, and justice.Historical context may explain Muhammad’s actions, but it cannotsanctifythem. Prophethood, by definition, transcends culture rather than conforming to it.The question therefore remains open—and pressing:Is slavery compatible with divine prophethood, or does it reveal the limits of Muhammad’s moral authority?Selected Referencesal-Nasa’i, Aḥmad ibn Shuʿayb.Sunan an-Nasa’i, Book 44, Hadith 4621.Crone, Patricia.Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam.

    "full_content": "The Falsehood of the Islamic ReligionBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute, Orlando, FloridaAbstractThis article critically examines the theological inconsistencies, historical contradictions, and spiritual fallacies within the Islamic religion from a biblical perspective. It compares the doctrinal claims of Islam with the revealed truth of Christianity, emphasizing the incompatibility between Allah, as described in the Qur’an, and Jehovah, the living God revealed in the Bible. Through textual analysis, comparative theology, and historical references, this work demonstrates that Islam, while presenting itself as monotheistic, diverges fundamentally from divine revelation and biblical truth. The study further evaluates the moral, spiritual, and salvific implications of following Islamic doctrines in contrast to the teachings of Jesus Christ. Ultimately, the paper argues that Islam represents a theological system built upon human innovation, false prophecy, and distortion of divine revelation, leading humanity away from the truth of God’s Word.IntroductionReligion occupies a profound place in the life of humanity, shaping beliefs, ethics, and worldviews. However, not all religions originate from divine revelation. The Bible clearly reveals that there exists both true and false worship (John 4:23–24). True religion emanates from the living God—Jehovah—who revealed Himself through His Word and His Son, Jesus Christ (Hebrews 1:1–2). False religion, conversely, originates from human invention or demonic deception, designed to distort the truth and mislead souls (2 Corinthians 11:13–15).Islam, which arose in the 7th century under Muhammad in Arabia, claims to continue the Abrahamic faith and to worship the same God as the Jews and Christians. Yet, a closer theological and historical examination reveals significant contradictions between the Islamic concept of Allah and the biblical revelation of God. These inconsistencies expose Islam as a faith system detached from divine inspiration and founded instead on cultural, political, and spiritual distortions.This paper aims to unveil the theological falsehood of Islam by examining key doctrines, the identity of Allah, the claims of Muhammad, and the relationship between the Qur’an and the Bible. Through this analysis, we will demonstrate that the God of the Bible—Jehovah—is not the Allah of Islam, and that the message of Jesus Christ stands in absolute contrast to the teachings of the Qur’an.Section I: The Nature of Religion and the ChurchReligion, in its essence, refers to humanity’s relationship with the divine. The word itself is derived from the Latinreligare, meaning “to bind again.” In biblical theology, religion is not merely a system of beliefs or rituals, but a covenant relationship between God and His people, grounded in revelation, obedience, and worship. Christianity, therefore, is not a humanly invented religion but a divine relationship established by God through Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Ephesians 2:8–9).Islam, by contrast, defines religion (dīn) primarily as submission or surrender (islām) to the will of Allah. However, the concept of surrender in Islam lacks the relational and redemptive dimensions found in Christianity. In the Bible, submission is not forced obedience under fear, but a loving response to God’s grace (Romans 12:1–2). Islam’s notion of faith is legalistic, built upon works and ritual observance, whereas biblical faith is relational, founded upon divine grace through Christ’s atonement.The church (ekklesia) in Christian theology represents the body of believers who are called out from the world to live in covenant relationship with God. It is not a political or national institution, but a spiritual community of the redeemed (1 Peter 2:9–10). In contrast, Islam establishes a religious-political community (ummah) that merges faith with state authority, blurring the distinction between spiritual devotion and political governance. This fusion of religion and politics in Islam has historically produced systems of coercion rather than spiritual transformation.Thus, while Christianity builds a kingdom within hearts through faith and love, Islam seeks to build a kingdom on earth through law and submission. This distinction marks the fundamental difference between the church of Christ and the Islamicummah: one is born of the Spirit (John 3:5–6), the other of the flesh and human institution.Section II: The Question of One GodBoth Christianity and Islam profess belief in one God. However, the nature of that God differs fundamentally. The Bible reveals one God who exists eternally in three persons—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (Matthew 28:19; 2 Corinthians 13:14). This Trinitarian revelation is not polytheism, as Muslims claim, but the fullness of divine unity expressed in relational plurality. God is love (1 John 4:8), and love requires relationship, even within His own being.Islam vehemently denies the Trinity, asserting the absolute oneness (tawḥīd) of Allah (Qur’an 112:1–4). However, this concept of God is solitary, impersonal, and unknowable. Allah is not portrayed as a relational being but as a distant sovereign who demands submission. The Qur’an explicitly rejects the sonship of Jesus (Qur’an 4:171; 5:72–73), thereby rejecting God’s revelation of Himself as Father. This denial is not merely a difference of terminology—it is a denial of God’s essential nature.The God of the Bible reveals Himself personally to humanity. He walks with Adam (Genesis 3:8), speaks to Moses face to face (Exodus 33:11), and dwells among His people through Christ (John 1:14). Allah, on the other hand, is described as transcendent and unknowable—beyond human relationship. The Qur’an repeatedly emphasizes that “nothing is like unto Him” (Qur’an 42:11), thereby placing Allah beyond all personal encounter.Consequently, while Islam claims to worship the same God as the Jews and Christians, its understanding of God’s nature is fundamentally incompatible with the biblical revelation of Jehovah. Christianity teaches that God’s oneness is relational and redemptive; Islam teaches that Allah’s oneness is solitary and authoritarian. This distinction alone is enough to show that Allah is not the God of the Bible.Section III: Theological Differences Between Allah and JehovahA critical examination of Allah and Jehovah reveals fundamental theological contradictions that expose Islam as a false religious system. While both claim monotheism, their attributes, purposes, and relationship with humanity differ dramatically.1. Jehovah: Personal, Relational, and LovingThe God of the Bible, Jehovah, is a personal and relational being. He reveals Himself through covenant promises and manifests His character through justice, mercy, and love (Exodus 34:6–7; Psalm 86:15). Jehovah desires a relationship with His creation and communicates His will through prophets, the Scriptures, and ultimately through Jesus Christ, His Son (Hebrews 1:1–2). Love, justice, and holiness are inseparable in Jehovah’s nature, guiding His actions toward humanity (1 John 4:8; Isaiah 61:8).2. Allah: Distant, Authoritarian, and ArbitraryIn contrast, Allah is portrayed in the Qur’an as distant, unpredictable, and often arbitrary. He commands obedience but rarely provides relational context. Islamic texts emphasize punishment for disbelief and reward for submission, yet the moral reasoning behind these decrees is often ambiguous. Allah’s mercy is conditional, and his wrath is repeatedly stressed (Qur’an 4:56; 5:33). Unlike Jehovah, Allah does not invite humanity into relational intimacy, nor does he reveal his essence in a way that allows trust based on character.3. The Problem of TruthfulnessThe Bible declares God to be wholly truthful and faithful (Numbers 23:19; Titus 1:2). Allah, however, is described in ways that allow deceit for divine purpose (Qur’an 3:54, 8:30). These passages have led scholars to question the moral and ethical coherence of Allah as a divine being, since divine truthfulness is a foundational requirement for any genuine deity.4. Implications for SalvationJehovah’s relational nature culminates in the gift of salvation through Jesus Christ (John 3:16; Romans 5:8). Salvation is not earned by works but received through faith. Islam, by contrast, presents salvation as earned through law and ritual obedience (Qur’an 2:82; 5:9). This legalistic system lacks the redemptive power necessary to restore humanity to God, leaving adherents in perpetual uncertainty regarding their ultimate fate.Section IV: The Character and Oaths of GodThe character of God serves as the ultimate standard for determining true religion. Jehovah consistently demonstrates unchanging righteousness, love, and faithfulness. Biblical oaths underscore God’s unbreakable promises (Hebrews 6:18). Every covenant in Scripture—from Noah to Abraham, and from Moses to Christ—reveals a God who is trustworthy and whose word is absolute.In contrast, Allah’s character, as portrayed in Islamic texts, fluctuates based on interpretation. Instances in the Qur’an depict Allah instructing deception, commanding contradictory acts, and instituting laws that shift between chapters and verses (Qur’an 2:106). Such inconsistencies call into question the reliability of Allah as a moral authority. Whereas Jehovah binds Himself to eternal truth, Allah appears bound only by the strategic needs of Muhammad’s revelations. This discrepancy undermines the claim of Islam to originate from a perfect and moral God.Section V: The Question of Truth and FalsehoodThe question of truth in religion is inseparable from the nature of God. Truth is defined as conformity to reality and faithfulness to God’s character. The Bible affirms that God is truth itself (John 17:17; Psalm 119:160). Any system that contradicts God’s revelation or distorts His message is, by definition, false.Islam presents numerous claims that conflict with both historical evidence and biblical revelation:The Prophethood of Muhammad– Muhammad’s claims of receiving divine revelation lack corroboration outside the Qur’an. Historical scrutiny exposes contradictions in his narrative, especially regarding moral, military, and spiritual conduct.The Integrity of Scripture– The Qur’an claims to confirm the Torah and the Gospel (Qur’an 5:46; 10:94), yet its content distorts fundamental biblical truths. Jesus’ divinity, crucifixion, and resurrection—central to salvation—are denied or misrepresented (Qur’an 4:157).Law and Grace– Islamic law relies on ritualistic obedience, whereas biblical truth emphasizes grace through faith (Ephesians 2:8–9). Any religion emphasizing works over grace fails to align with God’s salvific plan.These contradictions reveal that Islam cannot originate from Jehovah, the God of truth. By definition, a false religion misguides humanity and obscures access to genuine divine salvation.Section VI: Historical Examination of MuhammadMuhammad (570–632 CE) is central to Islamic belief. Islamic tradition venerates him as the Seal of the Prophets. However, historical analysis raises critical questions regarding his moral and spiritual authority:Unverified Revelations– Muhammad’s revelations, compiled into the Qur’an, emerged orally decades before being codified. Early Islamic historians note inconsistencies and redactions.Moral Contradictions– Biographical accounts describe actions by Muhammad—such as violence against non-Muslims, political expediency, and personal conduct—that contradict the moral perfection expected of a divine messenger (Ibn Ishaq,Sirat Rasul Allah).Claims of Exclusivity– Muhammad asserted that previous prophets were corrupted or false (Qur’an 2:79), directly contradicting the biblical record of God’s faithfulness and consistency.These historical considerations demonstrate that Muhammad’s prophetic claims lack the credibility, moral integrity, and divine corroboration necessary to establish a true religion.✅Next Sections to Include in Part Three (for completion of 12–15 pages)Section VII: Islamic Moral and Social Teachings vs. Biblical EthicsSection VIII: Comparative Analysis of Salvation, Judgment, and Eternal LifeSection IX: Theological and Spiritual Implications for FollowersSection X: Conclusion and Call to Biblical TruthReferences and BibliographySection VII: Islamic Moral and Social Teachings vs. Biblical EthicsIslamic moral and social teachings, as prescribed in the Qur’an and Hadith, present a framework that superficially resembles ethical conduct but, upon close examination, diverges significantly from biblical ethics.1. Justice and MercyThe Bible establishes justice and mercy as inseparable attributes of God (Micah 6:8; James 2:13). Jehovah’s justice is grounded in fairness and truth, while mercy tempers judgment with compassion. Islamic texts, however, often present justice as punitive and mercy as conditional, granted only to those who submit to specific ritual and legal obligations (Qur’an 4:92; 5:38). The focus on obedience rather than relational morality leads to a legalistic approach, undermining true ethical formation.2. Treatment of Non-MuslimsIslamic texts frequently prescribe discriminatory measures toward non-Muslims, including forced submission, subjugation, or punitive action (Qur’an 9:29; 48:29). In contrast, biblical ethics call for love of neighbor, even extending to enemies (Matthew 5:44; Romans 12:20). The ethical contrast reveals Islam’s moral system to be coercive rather than transformative.3. Role of Women and Family LifeIslamic teachings often enforce gender inequality and patriarchal dominance, limiting women’s agency and rights (Qur’an 4:34). Biblical teachings, while culturally situated, consistently affirm the dignity and worth of both men and women (Genesis 1:27; Galatians 3:28). Christianity’s relational ethic promotes mutual respect, love, and equality within family and society.Section VIII: Comparative Analysis of Salvation, Judgment, and Eternal LifeThe divergence between Christianity and Islam is most evident in doctrines of salvation, judgment, and eternal destiny.1. SalvationChristianity teaches that salvation is a gift of God through faith in Jesus Christ (Ephesians 2:8–9). Works are the fruit of faith, not the basis of salvation. Islam, in contrast, emphasizes works, ritual compliance, and legalistic obedience as prerequisites for salvation (Qur’an 2:82; 5:9). This system leaves adherents in perpetual uncertainty and fails to address humanity’s ultimate need for redemption.2. JudgmentBiblical judgment is rooted in God’s perfect knowledge, justice, and mercy (Romans 14:12; Revelation 20:12). Every individual will be judged according to truth and righteousness. Islamic judgment, however, is tied to ritualistic adherence and interpretation of law, making divine justice appear arbitrary and dependent on external conformity rather than inner transformation (Qur’an 101:6–9).3. Eternal LifeEternal life in Christianity is relational, entering into God’s presence through grace (John 17:3; 1 John 5:11–13). In Islam, eternal life is often described in physical terms (gardens, rivers, palaces) with unclear spiritual substance, emphasizing reward and punishment rather than a genuine relationship with God (Qur’an 76:12–22). This contrasts sharply with the biblical promise of spiritual intimacy and eternal fellowship with Jehovah.Section IX: Theological and Spiritual Implications for FollowersThe theological divergences between Islam and Christianity produce profound spiritual consequences. Followers of Islam, relying on ritual and works, remain disconnected from the personal and loving God revealed in Scripture. Their hope is contingent on external performance rather than faith in divine grace.Conversely, Christianity fosters an intimate relationship with God through Christ. Believers experience forgiveness, transformation, and assurance of salvation, grounded in the unchanging nature of Jehovah (2 Corinthians 5:17; Romans 8:38–39). Spiritual life in Islam remains legalistic, ritualistic, and uncertain, whereas biblical faith provides both certainty and transformative power.Section X: Conclusion and Call to Biblical TruthThe examination of Islamic theology, ethics, salvation, and history reveals inherent falsehoods when measured against the Bible’s standard of truth. Key conclusions include:Theological Contradictions– Allah’s characteristics and instructions contrast sharply with Jehovah’s revealed nature.Moral and Ethical Divergence– Islamic law and ethics emphasize coercion and conditional mercy, whereas biblical ethics emphasize love, justice, and mercy.Salvation and Eternal Destiny– Islam’s legalistic approach cannot reconcile humanity with God, whereas Christianity provides relational salvation through Jesus Christ.Historical and Prophetic Concerns– Muhammad’s life and claims, when critically examined, lack divine consistency and moral authority.Call to Action: Individuals seeking truth must examine religious claims critically, guided by the Word of God. Christianity alone provides a coherent, relational, and redemptive pathway to God. Islam, by contrast, presents a system of ritual, fear, and uncertainty that fails to deliver true salvation or moral certainty.References and BibliographyPrimary SourcesThe Holy Bible, King James Version.

    "full_content": "Shimba Theological Institute NewsletterReligious Freedom and Persecution in Uganda: Converts Facing Deadly ViolenceUganda, August 2021 – Reports of Lethal Attacks on Christian ConvertsRecent incidents in Uganda highlight the ongoing persecution faced by Christian converts, particularly those transitioning from Islam to Christianity in the eastern regions of the country. Despite constitutional guarantees of religious freedom, including the right to propagate one’s faith and convert from one religion to another, Christians—especially converts—continue to face harassment, threats, and even lethal violence.On 19 August 2021,Morning Star Newsreported the killing of a 20-year-old Christian convert in Kibuku District. The victim’s father, a Muslim, allegedly murdered him for refusing to renounce his new faith. Disturbingly, the father was not charged with murder, reportedly acting in the name of Islam.Just one week later, on 26 August 2021,Morning Star Newsreported another brutal case in Kabula village, near Iganga town. A former Islamic teacher who had converted to Christianity in 2015 was buried alive by hired assailants at the instigation of his Muslim relatives. His wife, present at the time of the attack, was told that her husband should have heeded prior warnings and returned to Islam.Commenting on these incidents, Yonas Dembele, World Watch Research analyst, noted:“The majority of the Ugandan population is Christian, and the constitution and other laws provide for religious freedom, including the right to propagate one’s faith and convert from one faith to another. This notwithstanding, the persecution and harassment of Christians, especially converts from Islam to Christianity in eastern areas of the country, is very common. The government remains silent about these incidents, and there is no indication that it will intervene with any serious intention of protecting Christians facing such violence. It would be prudent for the government to implement measures addressing violations of religious freedom, and to deal firmly with those responsible for harming Christians. Such action would serve as a deterrent and uphold the principles of justice and religious liberty.”These cases underscore a critical tension between constitutional protections and the realities on the ground. The Shimba Theological Institute calls upon Ugandan authorities, civil society, and religious leaders to ensure the protection of all citizens’ religious freedoms, particularly those who courageously choose to follow a faith different from their familial or community background.References:Morning Star News.

    "full_content": "The Irony of Muhammad as the “Best of Mankind” versus the Miraculous Claims of His BirthBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteIslamic tradition has long advanced the claim that Prophet Muhammad was the“best of mankind”(Arabic:khayr al-bashar), a title highly revered among Muslims. However, a critical and historical analysis of early Islamic sources reveals an irony: the Qur’an itself never explicitly declares Muhammad to be the“best of mankind”nor the“greatest creation”of Allah. Instead, this claim emerges in laterhadithandsiratraditions, often embellished with dramatic miraculous narratives that strain historical plausibility and theological consistency.Miraculous Fabrications at the Birth of MuhammadSeveral traditions ascribed to early Islamic historians such as Ibn Hisham and al-Tabari describe extraordinary occurrences at the birth of Muhammad, including:Muhammad was allegedly born circumcised and with natural eye-liner.¹A physical mark, the so-calledseal of prophethood, appeared on his shoulder.²Most notably, a bright light is reported to have shone from his mother Amina’s birth canal, illuminating palaces in Syria at the very moment of his birth.³The light allegedly extinguished a thousand-year-old Zoroastrian sacred fire in Persia.⁴These traditions, upon scrutiny, present insurmountable geographical and logical difficulties. For instance, the distance from Mecca to Syria is approximately1,974.7 km(via Route 328), while the fire temple in Persia would be over2,434 kmaway. The notion that a localized biological light source could traverse such distances defies both physical reality and theological reason.Critical QuestionsHow can a vaginal light, naturally directed downward, travel nearly 2,000 km to illuminate Syrian palaces?By what mechanism could this light extinguish a sacred fire over 2,400 km away?How does a single light simultaneously illuminate and extinguish, with contradictory physical effects, at such vast distances?These fabrications appear more as apologetic embellishments than historical events. Their function was likely to confer cosmic significance upon Muhammad’s birth, but they stand in stark contrast to the absence of such accounts in the Qur’an itself.Comparative Parallels with ChristianityA pattern emerges when comparing these narratives with the life of Jesus Christ as recorded in the Gospels. Islamic tradition often mirrors, or arguablyborrows from, Christian accounts:Triumphal Entry:Jesus rode into Jerusalem on a donkey (Matthew 21:5–7). By contrast, Islamic tradition describes Muhammad’sIsra and Mi’rajjourney on the winged creatureBuraq, sometimes confused in popular accounts with a donkey namedYa’fur.Light Motif:Jesus declares,“I am the light of the world”(John 8:12). In Islamic tradition, Muhammad’s mother is said to emit light at his birth—an apparent narrative borrowing to assign him similar messianic significance.Sinlessness:The New Testament affirms Jesus as sinless (Hebrews 4:15). Islam, however, presents Muhammad undergoing an angelic “purification” ritual where Jibril opens his chest and washes his heart with Zamzam water (Sahih al-Bukhari 3207), implying inherent impurity in contrast to Christ.Ascension:Jesus truly resurrected and ascended to heaven (Acts 1:9–11). Muhammad, by contrast, claimed a visionary night journey and ascension (Qur’an 17:1; Hadith), later embellished with meetings with earlier prophets.Defeat of Death:Jesus rose on the third day, conquering death (1 Corinthians 15:3–4). Muhammad, however, was left unburied for three days, and early Islamic sources acknowledge his body began to decompose.⁵ConclusionThe irony lies in the contrast between the Qur’an’s silence regarding Muhammad as the“best of mankind”and the later proliferation of legendary narratives intended to elevate his prophetic stature. These accounts—such as the “birth canal light” illuminating Syria and extinguishing fires in Persia—lack historical credibility and reveal a pattern of myth-making in Islam’s formative centuries.By contrast, the New Testament provides coherent, historically anchored accounts of Christ’s uniqueness—His sinlessness, divine identity, resurrection, and ascension—without reliance on implausible physical phenomena. For this reason, the Christian claim to salvation through Jesus Christ remains unparalleled and historically grounded, while legendary fabrications surrounding Muhammad continue to underscore the fragility of his constructed prophetic image.Salvation, therefore, is found not in fabricated lights or mythical journeys, but in the true Light of the World—Jesus Christ (John 8:12).ReferencesIbn Hisham,Sirat Rasul Allah, ed.

The incident, which took place in the Al-Salama district, has drawn widespread concern within the Muslim world and beyond.According to an official from the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice, the case was brought to light when a local student discovered the desecrated texts on his way home. Following the report, a municipal service company specializing in drainage maintenance was dispatched, and dozens of Qur’anic copies were retrieved from the sewer system. Photographs documenting the incident have since circulated widely on social media platforms, prompting public outrage.This occurrence is not an isolated case. Earlier in the year, similar allegations surfaced in Al-Haer province, where prison officials were accused of mishandling and insulting copies of the Qur’an, sparking protests across different regions of the Kingdom.The desecration of Islam’s holiest text within the birthplace of the religion has raised profound questions about internal custodianship, reverence for sacred texts, and the role of religious institutions in safeguarding what Muslims worldwide consider the unalterable Word of God. Incidents of this nature not only offend the religious sensitivities of over a billion believers but also invite renewed scrutiny on the spiritual and moral responsibilities of those entrusted with the preservation of holy scriptures.The Shimba Theological Institute emphasizes that respect for sacred texts—whether the Qur’an, the Bible, or other religious writings—is a foundational pillar of interfaith respect and theological integrity. Desecration undermines not only faith traditions but also the spiritual dignity of religious communities.As this issue continues to develop, the global religious community watches closely, calling for accountability, greater reverence, and the assurance that such acts are not repeated in the future.",

    "full_content": "Shimba Theological InstituteNewsletter ArticleBananas, Cucumbers, and the Politics of Gendered Morality in IslamIn recent decades, a number of reports and fatwas emerging from certain Islamic contexts have gained notoriety for their unusual—and deeply gendered—approach to sexuality. Among the most striking examples are clerical warnings issued against women consuming or even looking at objects such as cucumbers and bananas, on the grounds that these fruits allegedly provoke immoral thoughts. While these pronouncements might sound comical on the surface, they reflect a much deeper cultural and theological problem: the disproportionate moral burden placed upon women, contrasted with a conspicuous leniency extended to men.The policing of female sexuality in Islam has historically been tied to notions of family honor and social stability, wherein women’s bodies become sites of communal control. The prohibition of masturbation, the banning of sexual aids, and even restrictions on seemingly neutral foods underscore a worldview in which female desire is constructed as inherently dangerous and in need of containment. By contrast, in numerous Islamic traditions, men have historically been afforded a wide margin of sexual freedom, sometimes extending to permissiveness in cases of bestiality, which, though repugnant, has been disturbingly minimized by certain jurists. This double standard reveals an asymmetry not only in practice but also in theological imagination, where male transgression is trivialized while female embodiment is demonized.Theologically, such rulings expose the fragility of a system that cannot articulate a positive doctrine of the body, desire, and pleasure. Rather than acknowledging sexuality as a divine gift, certain Islamic discourses recast the female form and even neutral objects as latent weapons of sin. The image of a woman forbidden from holding a cucumber, lest she succumb to temptation, reflects not divine law but clerical anxiety. Ironically, this creates a parody of morality itself: a universe in which fruit is feared, women are hyper-policed, and men are excused from responsibility. What emerges is not holiness but hypocrisy—a distortion of justice, equity, and divine order.By contrast, the biblical and Christian theological tradition presents a radically different anthropology. The body is created good (Genesis 1:31), sexuality is sanctified within covenantal marriage (Hebrews 13:4), and moral responsibility is not gendered but universal (Galatians 3:28). Instead of reducing women to potential vectors of temptation, Scripture calls both men and women to holiness, accountability, and mutual honor. It is this vision of equality, justice, and embodied dignity that exposes the absurdity of clerics who fear cucumbers more than corruption, and bananas more than sin.Conclusion:The cucumber and banana fatwas should not merely amuse us; they should alert us to the depth of theological distortion that occurs when patriarchal anxieties replace divine revelation. At stake is not the morality of fruit but the integrity of human dignity, especially that of women, who deserve liberation from the crushing weight of such arbitrary and unequal moral codes. True holiness cannot be legislated through fear of vegetables but must be grounded in a biblical vision of the body as God’s temple, where freedom, dignity, and grace prevail.—Shimba Theological Institute",

This exploration is not intended to incite polemics but to apply rigorous theological and historical scrutiny to the prophet of Islam in contrast with the revealed standards of divine prophecy and messianic truth as preserved in the Judeo-Christian canon.IntroductionThe emergence of prophets throughout history has often accompanied both genuine divine calling and false representation. Jesus Christ warned His followers explicitly, saying,\"Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves\"(Matthew 7:15, ESV). In the context of eschatology and discernment, this article investigates Muhammad's prophetic role from a biblical and theological standpoint and argues that his teachings and actions demonstrate characteristics aligned with deceptive spiritual leadership.I. The Biblical Standard of ProphetsAccording to Deuteronomy 18:20–22, a prophet is authenticated by:Speaking in the name of the true God, Yahweh.Speaking only what God commands.Delivering prophecies that are fulfilled without contradiction.Maintaining moral and doctrinal consistency with God's established revelation.Moreover, Isaiah 8:20 asserts,\"To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.\"This provides a measuring rod against which all prophetic claims must be evaluated.II. Muhammad’s Prophethood in Islamic SourcesIslamic tradition holds that Muhammad began receiving revelations through the angel Jibril (Gabriel) in the Cave of Hira around 610 CE. However, multiple early Islamic sources present troubling inconsistencies regarding the origin, nature, and content of these revelations. For instance:The Satanic Verses IncidentAccording toAl-TabariandAl-Waqidi, Muhammad allegedly accepted pagan verses praising the Meccan goddesses al-Lat, al-Uzza, and Manat (cf. Surah An-Najm 53:19–22) and later claimed Satan deceived him. This confession alone, if accurate, directly contradicts the biblical criteria of divine inspiration (cf. Galatians 1:8–9).Doctrinal DivergenceMuhammad denied the crucifixion of Christ (Surah 4:157), rejected the divine Sonship of Jesus (Surah 112:3), and refuted the Trinity—all core tenets of biblical revelation. His teachings are not a continuation of the biblical narrative but a radical departure.Moral ContradictionsUnlike the biblical prophets who were held accountable to God's moral standards, Muhammad’s conduct—e.g., his marriage to Aisha at a very young age, the execution of the Banu Qurayza, and sanctioning temporary marriages (mut’ah)—raises serious ethical concerns when held against the fruits expected of a true prophet (Matthew 7:16–20).III. The Cloak of Righteousness: Muhammad’s SheepskinMuhammad often claimed continuity with the Abrahamic tradition, portraying himself as the final prophet in a long line of biblical figures. Yet, this alignment was superficial and strategic. While adopting elements of Jewish and Christian scriptures, he simultaneously altered or abrogated their core doctrines to fit a new religious and political paradigm under his authority.Appropriation of Biblical SymbolsMuhammad claimed to restore the \"pure monotheism\" of Abraham (Surah 2:135), but did so by stripping away the covenantal theology rooted in Isaac and Jacob (Genesis 17:19–21), instead privileging Ishmael.Use of Peaceful Language in Early Meccan SurahsDuring his early ministry in Mecca, Muhammad emphasized tolerance and peaceful coexistence. However, once in Medina, the tone of his revelations shifted toward militancy, with calls for jihad (e.g., Surah 9:5, 9:29). This duality reflects a calculated adaptation to political circumstances—a hallmark of deceptive leadership.IV. Fruits of the Prophet: A New Empire, Not a Kingdom of GodJesus warned that false prophets would be known by their fruits (Matthew 7:16). The fruits of Muhammad’s ministry were the creation of a militarized religious empire, coercion in belief, and the suppression of dissent. The early Islamic conquests were not primarily spiritual revivals but political expansions. This contrasts starkly with the apostles of Christ, who suffered and died for a non-violent, redemptive gospel rooted in sacrificial love and grace.V. Eschatological Warnings and Modern RelevanceJesus prophesied that“many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many”(Matthew 24:11). Muhammad's influence over 1.9 billion people may be interpreted by some as evidence of divine approval. Yet biblically, numerical success is never the sign of truth (cf. Matthew 7:13–14). In fact, broad acceptance often characterizes deception, especially in the end times. Theologically, Muhammad's legacy aligns not with the suffering servants of the biblical canon but with those who “transform themselves into apostles of Christ, but are false” (cf. 2 Corinthians 11:13–15).ConclusionThis scholarly investigation contends that Muhammad, examined in light of biblical prophetic criteria and early Islamic sources, fulfills the description of a \"wolf in sheep's clothing.\" His teachings subverted foundational biblical doctrines while cloaking themselves in Abrahamic language. While millions have followed him in sincerity, the theological legacy he left diverges from the Gospel of Jesus Christ, making discernment essential in the age of rising spiritual deception.ReferencesAl-Tabari,History of the Prophets and Kings, Vol. 6.Sahih Bukhari, Hadith collections.The Holy Qur’an, Surahs cited throughout.The Holy Bible, ESV/NASB.Ibn Ishaq,Sirat Rasul Allah(The Life of Muhammad).G.

    "full_content": "The Myth of Muhammad’s Fragrant Sweat: A Scientific and Theological CritiqueBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba — Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractIslamic tradition records claims that the Prophet Muhammad’s sweat was uniquely fragrant, collected by companions, and even considered a source of blessing (barakah). This article demonstrates that such claims are neither scientifically verifiable nor theologically defensible. From the standpoint of physiology, human sweat is odorless at secretion and gains its smell only through bacterial action; therefore, the suggestion that sweat can naturally exude perfume-like fragrance is unscientific. From the standpoint of theology, the idea that fragrance carries divine blessing is foreign to biblical revelation and inconsistent with God’s mode of authenticating prophets. Furthermore, Muhammad’s life practices—such as seizing booty (ghanimah) and personal gain from war spoils—undermine the notion that any supposed fragrance of his body conveyed holiness or divine sanction.1. The Hadith Narratives of “Fragrant Sweat”Several hadith from theSahihcollections record companions collecting Muhammad’s perspiration as perfume and blessing. Examples include:Sahih al-Bukhari 112(Book of Ablution):Narrated Anas bin Malik:“The Prophet came to our house and slept in our bed. He sweated during his sleep and my mother brought a bottle in which she collected that sweat and mixed it with his perfume. The smell of that perfume remained for a long time.”Sahih Muslim 2331(Book of Virtues):Anas bin Malik reported:“The Messenger of Allah came to our house and slept. He began to perspire and Umm Sulaym brought a bottle in which she collected his sweat and poured it into perfume. The Messenger of Allah said: ‘O Umm Sulaym, what is this?’ She said: ‘It is your sweat, and we mix it in our perfume, and it becomes the most fragrant of all.’”These reports are the basis for the belief that Muhammad’s sweat was not only fragrant but carriedbarakah.2. Scientific Refutation: Sweat Has No Intrinsic FragranceModern physiology shows that sweat is odorless at secretion. Eccrine sweat (for cooling) is mostly water and salts, while apocrine sweat (in armpits, groin) contains proteins and lipids that bacteria break down into volatile compounds, producing odor. Pleasant fragrance cannot arise intrinsically from sweat. Any extraordinary scent must therefore be explained naturally (use of perfumes, oils, or exaggeration) or as devotional embellishment. Scientifically, sweat cannot be perfume.3. Theological Absurdity: Fragrance as “Barakah”Even if Muhammad’s sweat smelled pleasant, fragrance cannot impart blessing. In the Bible, blessing (barakah) comes from God’s covenantal promises, not from human bodily fluids (Genesis 12:2–3; Psalm 119:1–2). Prophets were validated by the truth of God’s word and miracles consistent with divine revelation—not by sweat or perfume.Furthermore, Muhammad authorized and benefited from seizing property and spoils of war (Quran 8:1, 41). Such actions contradict holiness and discredit the idea that God would sanctify his perspiration as a means of blessing.4. The Poisoning at Khaybar: A Counterexample to “Healing Sweat”Sahih al-Bukhari 4428narrates that Muhammad said:“I continued to feel pain from the food which I had eaten at Khaybar, and at this time, I feel as if my aorta is being cut from that poison.”If his body carried healing properties, why did his sweat not heal him from the effects of poison? Why did divine protection not preserve him? This contradiction exposes the falsehood of the myth.ConclusionThe hadith about Muhammad’s fragrant sweat fail scientifically, theologically, and morally. Scientifically, sweat is odorless until bacteria act upon it. Theologically, blessing comes from God’s word, not from perspiration. Morally, Muhammad’s material enrichment from booty undermines claims of holiness. Historically, his death by poisoning reveals the inconsistency of claims that his body carried miraculous healing.The tradition of “fragrant sweat” is therefore not divine truth but a fabricated hagiographical embellishment—evidence of Muhammad’s false prophethood rather than divine authentication.BibliographySahih al-Bukhari, Hadith 112, 4428.Sahih Muslim, Hadith 2331.The Holy Bible: Genesis 12:2–3; Deuteronomy 8:3; Psalm 119:1–2; Isaiah 40:8.Quran 8:1, 41.American Society for Microbiology. “Microbial Origins of Body Odor.”Lam, T.H. et al.Understanding the Microbial Basis of Body Odor.Microbiome, 2018.StatPearls. “Anatomy: Skin Sweat Glands.” NCBI Bookshelf, 2022.The Myth of Muhammad’s Fragrant Sweat: A Scientific and Theological CritiqueBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba — Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractIslamic tradition records claims that the Prophet Muhammad’s sweat was uniquely fragrant, collected by companions, and even considered a source of blessing (barakah). This article demonstrates that such claims are neither scientifically verifiable nor theologically defensible. From the standpoint of physiology, human sweat is odorless at secretion and gains its smell only through bacterial action; therefore, the suggestion that sweat can naturally exude perfume-like fragrance is unscientific. From the standpoint of theology, the idea that fragrance carries divine blessing is foreign to biblical revelation and inconsistent with God’s mode of authenticating prophets. Furthermore, Muhammad’s life practices—such as seizing booty (ghanimah) and personal gain from war spoils—undermine the notion that any supposed fragrance of his body conveyed holiness or divine sanction. The tradition is therefore better understood as a hagiographical embellishment designed to elevate Muhammad’s image, rather than as evidence of true prophecy.1. The Hadith Narratives of “Fragrant Sweat”Canonical hadith collections (e.g.,Sahih al-Bukhari,Sahih Muslim) contain reports that Muhammad’s companions, such as Umm Sulaym, collected his perspiration in bottles and mixed it with perfume. They claimed it smelled sweeter than musk and preserved it as a form of blessing (barakah). Such reports became part of Islamic relic-veneration, where Muhammad’s bodily traces—hair, saliva, sweat—were attributed miraculous properties.Yet this tradition itself reveals theological inconsistency: blessing is redirected from the word of God to a bodily secretion. Instead of revelation being the locus of divine power, physical residues become idolized. This not only departs from biblical precedent, where prophets are validated by their obedience to God’s word and true miracles, but also undermines the uniqueness of God as the source of blessing (Deut. 8:3; Isa. 40:8).2. Scientific Refutation: Sweat Has No Intrinsic FragrancePhysiological science is unequivocal: sweat secreted by eccrine glands (responsible for thermoregulation) is nearly pure water with small amounts of salts. It is odorless at secretion. Apocrine sweat, found in areas like the armpits, contains proteins and lipids, but it too has no inherent fragrance. Body odor arises when bacteria metabolize these compounds, producing volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Thus, the idea of perfume-like fragrance emanating naturally from sweat has no scientific foundation.Any unusual pleasant odor associated with Muhammad’s body must be attributed to cultural exaggeration, added perfumes, or retrospective idealization. It cannot serve as proof of divine intervention or prophetic authenticity.3. Theological Absurdity: Fragrance as “Barakah”Even if one grants that Muhammad’s sweat smelled pleasant, fragrance itself cannot impart blessing. In Scripture, blessing comes from God’s covenantal promises and obedience to His word—not from human sweat, relics, or bodily fluids (Genesis 12:2–3; Psalm 119:1–2). True prophets of God were validated by their fidelity to divine revelation, not by physical residues.Moreover, Muhammad’s conduct stands in contradiction to the claim of holiness. He sanctioned the seizure of war booty and distributed property taken from others as spoils (Quran 8:1, 41). If his lifestyle included accumulation of wealth and benefit from conquest, it is incongruous to suggest that his sweat, a natural byproduct of the body, could simultaneously serve as a channel of divine blessing. A man who materially profited from battle cannot be the vessel through which God channels supernatural sanctity via perspiration.4. The Poisoning at Khaybar: A Counterexample to “Healing Sweat”Hadith also record that Muhammad suffered lingering pain from poisoned meat eaten at Khaybar (Sahih al-Bukhari). If his bodily fluids truly bore healing and protective power, why was he not protected from poisoning? Why did his supposedbarakahnot neutralize the effects of poison within his own body? This contradiction exposes the myth of fragrant, healing sweat as a fabrication of hagiography rather than divine fact.ConclusionThe claim that Muhammad’s sweat was fragrant and a source of blessing fails both scientifically and theologically. Scientifically, sweat has no fragrance of its own; any pleasant odor must be explained naturally, not supernaturally. Theologically, blessing is mediated by God’s word, not by sweat. Furthermore, Muhammad’s actions in claiming booty undermine the credibility of any claim to holiness associated with his body. Finally, the poisoning incident demonstrates that his body was not endowed with healing or protective power.Taken together, the myth of “fragrant sweat” is not evidence of divine authentication but a devotional fiction designed to exalt Muhammad. It reveals a reliance on embellishment rather than truth, confirming that such traditions do not originate from God and that Muhammad cannot be upheld as a true prophet.BibliographySahih al-Bukhari, Book of Ablutions, Hadith on Umm Sulaym collecting Muhammad’s sweat.Sahih Muslim, reports on companions preserving his perspiration.Quran 8:1, 41 — texts on war booty and Muhammad’s share.American Society for Microbiology. “Microbial Origins of Body Odor.”Lam, T.H. et al.Understanding the Microbial Basis of Body Odor.Microbiome, 2018.StatPearls. “Anatomy: Skin Sweat Glands.” NCBI Bookshelf, 2022.The Holy Bible.

    "full_content": "Why Islamic Punishment for Adultery Appears Contradictory and Unequal:An Academic ReflectionBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteIn Islamic jurisprudence, discussions surrounding the punishment for adultery reveal significant textual and interpretive tensions. The Qur’an, considered by Muslims to be the ultimate and infallible divine revelation, outlines a specific punishment for zina (adultery or fornication) in Surah An-Nur 24:2. The verse prescribes one hundred lashes for both the man and the woman found guilty of the act, and it stipulates that the punishment must be administered publicly in the presence of other believers. Notably, the Qur’anic text does not differentiate between offenders who are married (muhsan) and those who are unmarried (ghayr muhsan), thereby presenting a uniform penalty for all.However, within Islamic tradition, a second layer of authority emerges through the Hadith literature—sayings and actions attributed to Prophet Muhammad. In Sahih Bukhari (Book 8, Hadith 805), the punishment of death by stoning (rajm) is introduced, particularly for married adulterers. This creates a sharp contrast with the Qur’anic prescription. The Qur’an itself, in its Arabic form, contains no reference to stoning in connection with adultery. Yet some translations and commentaries insert the term “stoning” in parentheses, signaling that it is not part of the original Arabic text but rather an interpretive addition intended to align the Qur’anic verse with hadith-based jurisprudence.This divergence raises critical questions regarding the hierarchy of Islamic legal sources. If the Qur’an is believed to be perfect and complete, why then must hadith literature introduce a harsher penalty not explicitly stated in the Qur’anic revelation? Which source, therefore, should be considered authoritative—Allah’s law in the Qur’an or Muhammad’s rulings in the Hadith?The issue becomes even more complex when examining how these punishments are applied in practice. Historical and contemporary reports demonstrate that women often bear the brunt of zina-related penalties. Social norms, unequal evidentiary standards, and patriarchal cultural environments contribute to disproportionate punishment of women, making the legal tradition appear heavily biased. This leads to broader theological and ethical questions: Why do the punishments attributed to Allah seem to oppress women? And why does Islamic jurisprudence, as practiced in several Muslim societies, consistently place women at a disadvantage in matters of moral and legal accountability?These tensions continue to spark academic, religious, and human rights debates worldwide, especially concerning the nature of divine justice, the reliability of secondary Islamic sources, and the status of women within Islamic legal frameworks.If that is the case, which one has the true authority? Is it Allah’s law in the Qur’an, or Muhammad’s Hadith?Why is it that women alone are often the ones punished under this law?Why are Allah’s punishments so oppressive toward women?",

She began chasing me, almost flying toward the window, trying to reach me. I jumped down from the veranda of that tall building and ran away. She leaped from above, flying after me, but she failed to catch me…”I have seen many people struggling with similar dreams, and many Christians often ask:Why do Muslims appear to favor the color black so much? Why do jinn appear in dreams wearing black veils similar to Muslim women? Why has this belief system produced such troubling spiritual experiences in society?To understand this, we must look atthe root, because the origin of a thing explains its purpose. The root is always hidden underground, yet it determines the life of what grows above the ground. A person suffering tooth pain must find the root cause; the root may be rotten, and unless it is examined, the entire tooth will continue to ache.Therefore, we must examine carefully whether this matter originates from the true God—or not!Why Is the Color Black Highly Honored in Islam?Why do Muslim women wear black veils that resemble those worn by jinn?Why does the Kaaba in Mecca have a massive black stone and a black covering?Dr. Abu Ameenah, in his bookTHE JINN(Chapter 4, p. 68), wrote:“Prophet Muhammad said that a black dog is a devil; and since the jinn were created from fire, the remaining heat in them caused them to prefer the color black.”This is the reason the color black is exalted in Islam. Muslim women are seen wearing black veils that cover them completely from head to toe.Is this not a sign that Islam and satanic symbolism share the same imagery?What Does Color Represent Biblically?God uses colors in Scripture to communicate spiritual messages. For example, after Noah left the ark, God placed therainbow—a combination of seven colors—as a covenant that He would never again destroy the earth with a flood.Why specificallyseven colors? Why not another sign or an image?Becausecolors carry deep spiritual meaning in the realm of the Spirit.Biblical Meanings of Colors1. GreenGreen representslife, prosperity, freshness, and fruitfulness. Where there is life, there is greenness. When rain falls, plants sprout and appear green, symbolizing blessing and favor.Genesis 1:11– “Then God said, ‘Let the earth bring forth grass…’”Thus, in visions or dreams, green signifiesgrace and blessing ahead.2. BlueBlue representsthe glory of God.“...When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers…”—Psalm 8:3Large bodies of water—lakes, seas—appear blue from a distance. When God shows you blue in a vision, He is revealingHis glory and majesty.3. WhiteWhite representspurity, holiness, and divine light.Where there is whiteness, nothing can hide; even dirt is easily exposed. God often reveals Himself in white garments, white hair, and heavenly brightness.Revelation 1:14 – Christ with white hairDaniel 7:9 – The Ancient of Days, with white clothingRevelation 20:11 – The White ThroneRevelation 3:5 – Saints given white garmentsHeaven itself is associated with this pure brilliance.White symbolizesholiness, purity, and the presence of the Holy Spirit.4. BlackBlack representsdarkness, because darkness is visually black.Evil deeds are done in darkness.Jude 1:13describes blackness as the domain of darkness reserved for the ungodly.Thus, black symbolizesthe kingdom of darkness and the authority of Satan. So, when one encounters black in a spiritual dream—such as the testimony above—one must seek God for guidance in spiritual warfare, because satanic forces may be involved.If all Muslims worldwide gather in Mecca to circle and kiss the Black Stone, is this not a sign that what is being venerated originates from the kingdom of darkness?Why is black exalted, honored, and even worshiped within Islam?Think deeply.Ask questions.Take action.Come to Jesus.",

    "full_content": "Shimba Theological InstituteScholarly Newsletter ArticleTitle: The Cousin of Muhammad Who Renounced Islam — Ubayd-Allah ibn Jahsh: A Forgotten Witness of the GospelBy Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThe nameUbayd-Allah ibn Jahshis not widely known today, yet he stands among the earliest and most compelling witnesses to the transformative power of the Gospel—even within the challenging and hostile environment of early Islam. A close cousin of the Prophet Muhammad, Ubayd-Allah’s life story provides a unique historical and theological reflection on the encounter between Islam and Christianity in the formative years of the 7th century.Background: A Noble Lineage and Early FaithUbayd-Allah ibn Jahsh was a near relative of Muhammad (peace be upon him) and was among the first individuals to accept Islam when it began to spread in Mecca. However, the early Muslims faced intense persecution from the Quraysh tribe, prompting a small group to flee Mecca in 615 A.D. and seek refuge in the Christian kingdom of Abyssinia (modern-day Ethiopia). This migration, known in Islamic history as theFirst Hijra, was made under the reign ofNegus—a just and compassionate Christian ruler renowned for his kindness toward refugees and the oppressed.It was in Abyssinia, a land of religious freedom and Christian heritage, that Ubayd-Allah encountered the teachings of Jesus Christ more intimately. Through his exposure to the Gospel, his heart was deeply moved and transformed in a profound way.Conversion to ChristianityHistorical traditions recount that Ubayd-Allah reflected deeply upon the message of the Gospel. After a period of contemplation and prayer, he made a bold and life-altering decision—to renounce Islam and embrace Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior. He reportedly declared:“I have come to know Christ here, and in my heart I have felt a new light that I had never known before. I now follow Christ, the Son of the Living God.”These words, preserved in early Christian oral traditions, reveal the depth of his spiritual conviction. His decision, however, was met with dismay and hostility from his fellow Muslim emigrants and from his relatives who remained in Mecca.Persecution and Faithfulness unto DeathDespite pressure, insults, and condemnation, Ubayd-Allah remained steadfast in his newfound faith until his death in Abyssinia. His unwavering commitment serves as a testament to personal conviction and spiritual courage in the face of adversity.Yet, his story took a dramatic and controversial turn. After Ubayd-Allah’s conversion and subsequent death, the Prophet Muhammad took his widow,Umm Habiba bint Abi Sufyan, as one of his wives. Islamic historians such asIbn Ishaqandal-Tabarirecord this event, often in defense of Muhammad’s action and as criticism toward Ubayd-Allah’s apostasy. Nevertheless, this act raises moral and theological questions regarding justice, compassion, and divine retribution.Moral and Theological ReflectionsThe incident leaves behind a trail of ethical inquiry. Was Muhammad’s decision to marry the wife of a man who had renounced Islam a matter of divine justice—or personal retaliation? Historical silence on Ubayd-Allah’s own perspective invites reflection on issues of human dignity, religious freedom, and conscience.Ubayd-Allah’s faith journey was not built upon cultural conformity but upon spiritual revelation and conviction. While others feared losing status or reputation, he chose the way of the cross and bore the cost of discipleship, affirming his allegiance to the risen Christ.Legacy of FaithToday, the testimony of Ubayd-Allah ibn Jahsh stands as a symbol of courage, integrity, and divine love that transcends religious, familial, and cultural boundaries. He was not merely Muhammad’s cousin—he was a witness to the Gospel amidst the tempest of opposition.As the Apostle Paul declares:“For I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth.” —Romans 1:16 (KJV)Ubayd-Allah’s story is a voice echoing across centuries, reminding believers that truth is worth standing for—even when it costs everything.ConclusionAlthough rarely recounted within Islamic narratives, the life and faith of Ubayd-Allah ibn Jahsh challenge both historians and theologians to re-examine the early intersections of Islam and Christianity. His spiritual journey illustrates the enduring power of the Gospel to illuminate even the darkest contexts.To the Christian believer, he remains a model of spiritual conviction—one who discovered the light of Christ amidst the shadows of uncertainty and chose eternal truth over temporal allegiance.ReferencesIbn Ishaq.Sirat Rasul Allah (The Life of Muhammad).

    "full_content": "THE COUSIN OF MUHAMMAD WHO RENOUNCED ISLAMUbayd-Allah ibn Jahsh is a name not very well known today, but he is among the earliest witnesses of the power of the Gospel even in difficult and unexpected circumstances.He was a close cousin of the Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W), and also among the first people to accept Islam as soon as it began to be proclaimed in Mecca.Because of the severe persecution that faced the early Muslims, Ubayd-Allah was among the small group of people who decided to flee Mecca in the year 615 A.D. and migrate to the land of Abyssinia (present-day Ethiopia), which was under a Christian king called Negus, a leader known for his justice and mercy toward refugees and the oppressed. In that land of protection and religious freedom, Ubayd-Allah encountered in depth the teachings of Christianity, and through the Gospel of Jesus Christ his heart was uniquely touched.He reflected, he prayed, and finally he decided to renounce Islam and follow Jesus Christ.“I came to know Christ here, and in my heart I felt a new light that I did not know before. I follow Christ, the Son of the Living God,”these words are quoted in the traditional accounts of early Christians who knew him.His decision was not received with joy by the Muslim community that was with him, nor by his relatives who remained in Mecca.But despite pressure, insults, and blame, he remained firm in his faith until his death while still in Abyssinia.But what followed was a shocking event that raises many questions. After Ubayd-Allah renounced Islam, the Prophet Muhammad decided to take his wifeUmm Habiba bint Abi Sufyanand marry her himself. Meaning Muhammad saw it fit to snatch the wife of his cousin because he had left Islam. 😂😂This action has been explained by many Islamic historians such as Ibn Ishaq, al-Tabari, and others, though from a perspective that criticizes Ubayd-Allah and defends the Prophet...This created pain and shock, for a man who decided to follow his spiritual conscience and leave the religion of his people lost his honor and even his family for the price of following Christ.Although his personal feelings about this act were not written clearly, the situation itself leaves questions of justice and humanity.“He decided to seize the wife of a man who left Islam—was that justice or revenge?”Ubayd-Allah did not base his faith on customs, but followed it through inner conviction and spiritual testimony.While others feared losing position or honor, he chose the way of the cross and renounced the religion of Islam and said “yes” to the living Christ.Today, the story of Ubayd-Allah ibn Jahsh is a symbol of courage, a pure conscience, and a testimony of the love of God that crosses the boundaries of religion, family, and even nation.This man was not just a cousin of Muhammad, but a witness of the Gospel who stood in the midst of the storm. To me, he is my role model.The Bible says:“For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ; for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth...” — Romans 1:16This is the story of one man, but it is the voice of all who have ever stood for the truth even when it hurt them.THIS STORY IS VERY RARELY TOLD IN ISLAM.",

It argues that the Qur’an implicitly acknowledges that Satan operates within Islam’s “straight path,” thereby challenging the claim of Islam as a purely divine religion. Furthermore, it explores how the Qur’an inadvertently affirms central Christian doctrines such as the redemptive role of Jesus Christ, the bearing of human sin, and divine salvation. The discussion integrates Qur’anic and Biblical texts, demonstrating that the Christian concept of the Savior is both scripturally and logically superior.1. IntroductionIslamic theology maintains that no person can bear the sin or burden of another. However, several Qur’anic verses appear to contradict this assertion. In contrast, the Bible provides a clear framework for redemption through the atoning work of Jesus Christ, the Lord and Savior. This paper will explore four primary theological admissions in the Qur’an:The Qur’an acknowledges Jesus as Savior.The Qur’an acknowledges that Muslims bear heavy burdens of sin.The Qur’an acknowledges that Satan dwells on the straight path — which it identifies as Islam.Muhammad is recorded to have converted Satan to Islam.2. The Qur’an Acknowledges That Some Bear the Sins of OthersIslamic preachers often teach that everyone is responsible for their own sins. Yet, the Qur’an provides a different perspective.“And when we heard the guidance, we believed in it; and whoever believes in his Lord shall not fear loss or being burdened with the sins (of others).”(Qur’an 72:13)This verse implies that those who do not believe in Allah may bear the burdens of others’ sins. Further clarification is found in:“That they may bear their own burdens in full on the Day of Resurrection and also part of the burdens of those whom they mislead without knowledge. Evil indeed is that which they shall bear!”(Qur’an 16:25)The Qur’an therefore acknowledges that some individuals can carry both their own sins and the sins of those they have misled. These “burdens” are described as grievous and intolerable.3. The Biblical Response: Jesus as the Bearer of Our BurdensWhile the Qur’an leaves the burden of sin unresolved, the Bible provides the divine remedy:“Cast your burden on the Lord, and He shall sustain you; He shall never permit the righteous to be moved.”(Psalm 55:22)This is echoed in the New Testament:“You call me Teacher and Lord, and you say well, for so I am.”(John 13:13)Jesus is not only the Teacher but also the Lord who carries our burdens. Jeremiah affirms His divinity:“But the Lord is the true God; He is the living God and the everlasting King.”(Jeremiah 10:10)Thus, while the Qur’an burdens believers with sin, the Bible offers deliverance through Jesus Christ, the true and living God.4. The Qur’an Acknowledges Jesus as the Living SaviorIn the Qur’an we read:“All that is in the heavens and the earth ask of Him: every day He is bringing about a matter.”(Qur’an 55:29)This verse implies that all creation looks to Him — a concept resonating with Christ’s divine sustenance over all creation. The Christian scriptures explain that Christ’s redemptive work was accomplished through His death and resurrection:“For Christ also suffered once for sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive by the Spirit.”(1 Peter 3:18–19)The distinction between body and spirit clarifies that Jesus’ divine nature remained eternal and unkillable:“He alone is immortal and dwells in unapproachable light, whom no one has seen or can see.”(1 Timothy 6:15–16)Hence, the Savior who died bodily yet lived spiritually is the same eternal God revealed in Scripture.5. The Qur’an Admits That Satan Dwells on the Straight PathMuslims often describe theSirat al-Mustaqim(“the straight path”) as the true path of Islam. Yet, the Qur’an contains a startling admission:“He said: Because You have sent me astray, surely I will lie in wait for them on Your straight path.”(Qur’an 7:16)Satan explicitly vows to reside on Allah’s “straight path.” To identify what this path is, the Qur’an defines it:“And this is the path of your Lord, a straight path. We have detailed Our revelations for people who take heed.”(Qur’an 6:126)If the Qur’an itself identifies Islam as Allah’s straight path, and Satan has sworn to remain upon that path, then logically, Satan operates within the sphere of Islam’s religious system. This revelation has profound theological implications: Islam’s straight path is not exempt from satanic infiltration but, according to the Qur’an itself, is the very place Satan vowed to dwell.6. Muhammad’s Alleged Conversion of SatanThe bookAsili ya Majini(“The Origin of the Jinn”) states:“It is unfortunate that Adam and Eve did not make an effort to enable Satan and his offspring to seek forgiveness from God. It was only the Prophet Muhammad who converted Satan to Islam.”(Asili ya Majini, p. 20)If Muhammad indeed converted Satan, this affirms two theological points:Satan exists within Islam’s spiritual structure.Satan is acknowledged as a Muslim in Islamic tradition.Such a doctrine is profoundly disturbing, as it merges the very being of evil with the framework of Islamic piety.7. Theological ImplicationsFrom this comparative theological analysis, several conclusions emerge:Satan’s residence— According to the Qur’an, Satan dwells on the “straight path,” which is Islam (Qur’an 6:126; 7:16).Human burden of sin— The Qur’an admits that humans may bear others’ sins (Qur’an 16:25), contradicting its own principle of individual accountability.Jesus as Redeemer— The Qur’an inadvertently points toward the Biblical revelation of a Savior who alone bears sin (Psalm 55:22; 1 Peter 3:18–19).Muhammad and Satan— Extra-Qur’anic sources allege Muhammad’s reconciliation with Satan, further complicating the monotheistic claim of Islam.Thus, from both logical and theological reasoning,the Qur’an cannot consistently uphold the divine holiness of Allah, for its text accommodates both sin-bearing humans and a “straight path” inhabited by Satan.In contrast, theBible reveals a holy God without religious contradictions — a God who is Spirit (John 4:24), perfect, and free from darkness (1 John 1:5).8. ConclusionThis analysis establishes that the Qur’an itself acknowledges the presence of Satan within Islam’s spiritual structure. Therefore, Islam cannot represent the pure and holy path of God. Only Jesus Christ, the true and living Savior, can bear the burdens of humanity, offering redemption through His divine sacrifice and resurrection.As written inTitus 2:13:“Looking for the blessed hope and glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ.”ReferencesPrimary Sources:The Holy Qur’an, Surah 6:126; 7:16; 16:25; 55:29; 72:13.The Holy Bible(NKJV): Psalm 55:22; Jeremiah 10:10; John 13:13; 1 Peter 3:18–19; 1 Timothy 6:13–16; Titus 2:13.Asili ya Majini(The Origin of the Jinn), p. 20.Secondary Sources:Ibn Kathir,Tafsir Ibn Kathir(Darussalam, 2000).Al-Tabari,Jami‘ al-Bayan fi Tafsir al-Qur’an(Cairo: Dar al-Ma‘arif, 1968).Shimba, Maxwell.Max Shimba Ministries Org, 2016.By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaServant of Jesus Christ, Our Great God and SaviorFor Max Shimba Ministries Org ©2016All Rights Reserved",

    "full_content": "The Societal and Security Implications of Full-Face CoveringsBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis paper critically examines the social, ethical, and security implications associated with the public use of full-face coverings, specifically niqabs and burqas. While the debate often centers on religious freedom and personal expression, this study highlights the pressing security concerns and social vulnerabilities that arise from unidentifiable individuals in public spaces. The analysis is informed by documented incidents of criminal exploitation of full-face coverings and argues for a balanced approach between personal liberty and public safety.IntroductionIn modern pluralistic societies, the tension between religious freedom and public safety continues to provoke complex ethical and legal discussions. Among these issues is the use of full-face coverings—such as the niqab and burqa—which conceal a person’s identity entirely. While such garments hold deep religious and cultural significance for many Muslim women, their unrestricted use in public raises legitimate security and ethical concerns.Security and Social RisksFull facial concealment poses a fundamental challenge to security systems and social trust. The inability to identify individuals in public settings creates opportunities for criminal exploitation. Empirical evidence and case studies reveal instances where male offenders have disguised themselves in full-face coverings to commit acts of voyeurism, theft, and harassment.For example, inKochi, India, a man wearing a burqa was arrested for surreptitiously recording women in a restroom facility. Similarly, inKozhikode, a laboratory operator used similar methods to install hidden cameras in shared washrooms. InNew York City, law enforcement officials documented an incident in which a burglar disguised in a burqa successfully evaded identification after stealing jewelry. Such cases underscore the vulnerability created by garments that obscure the face in public spaces.Ethical and Psychological DimensionsFrom a moral and theological perspective, social order is sustained by accountability and mutual recognition—principles affirmed in both biblical and secular ethical traditions. When individuals are permitted to appear in public without any visible identity, this erodes communal trust and facilitates anonymity-driven deviance. Psychologically, anonymity can embolden anti-social behavior by weakening the individual’s internal restraint mechanisms, a concept well documented in social psychology (Zimbardo, 1969).Public Health and Biosecurity ConsiderationsBeyond social and moral implications, full-face coverings may also introduce public health risks if exploited maliciously. Hypothetical but conceivable scenarios—such as the deliberate concealment of identity for the spread of infectious diseases or biohazardous acts—highlight the potential misuse of such anonymity. This underlines the necessity for public policy to consider not only cultural sensitivity but also the imperative of collective safety.Policy RecommendationGovernments should consider implementing legislation that limits the use of full-face coverings in sensitive public environments such as banks, schools, hospitals, airports, and restrooms. Such restrictions should not be viewed as discriminatory but as essential measures for ensuring the protection and dignity of all citizens, particularly women and children who may be most at risk from hidden predators.ConclusionWhile the right to religious expression is fundamental, it must coexist with the right to personal safety and public security. The niqab and burqa, when used in unrestricted contexts, present legitimate concerns that societies cannot ignore. As communities strive for harmony and protection of human dignity, it becomes necessary to draw reasonable boundaries that preserve both freedom and safety.ReferencesZimbardo, P. G.

    "full_content": "MUHAMMAD IS WORSHIPPED BY BEASTS AND TREES: A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF AÏSHA’S TESTIMONYBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis paper examines a controversial Hadith narrated by Aisha, the wife of Prophet Muhammad, as recorded inJamiʿ al-Tirmidhi Hadith 3270. The narration reports that animals and trees prostrated before Muhammad, implying an act of worship. The Companions, amazed by this act, suggested that they too should prostrate before him. This Hadith raises deep theological questions about the nature of worship, the distinction between servitude to God and reverence for a human, and the boundaries of Islamic monotheism (tawḥīd). The paper seeks to evaluate the theological, logical, and Qur’anic inconsistencies that emerge from this narration.The Quoted HadithAl-Tirmidhi, Hadith 3270— Narrated by Aisha:\"Once when Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) was with a number of the Emigrants and Helpers, a camel came and prostrated itself before him. Thereupon his Companions said, ‘Messenger of Allah, beasts and trees prostrate themselves before you, but we have the greatest right to do so.’ He replied, ‘Worship your Lord and honor your brother. If I were to order anyone to prostrate himself before another, I should order a woman to prostrate herself before her husband. If he were to order her to convey stones from a yellow mountain to a black one, or from a black mountain to a white one, it would be incumbent on her to do so.’\"(Transmitted by Ahmad and al-Tirmidhi)Theological and Logical InquiryAisha’s narration introduces profound theological implications that challenge Islamic monotheism (Tawḥīd al-ʿUlūhiyyah). The fact that animals and trees allegedlyprostrated before Muhammadimplies an act of reverence reserved for divine beings. In Islam,sujūd(prostration) is a distinct form of worship that belongs exclusively to Allah (Surah 41:37; 22:18). Thus, if non-human creation performed this before Muhammad, several critical questions arise:Did the animals and trees commit shirk (idolatry)?According toSurah al-Anbiyāʾ 21:98–99,“Indeed, you and what you worship besides Allah are the fuel of Hell. You will surely enter it. If those had truly been gods, they would not have entered it, but all will abide therein forever.”This verse condemns all beings that are worshipped besides Allah. If animals and trees prostrated before Muhammad, does this not make him the object of their worship?Why did Allah allow this to occur?If Muhammad is truly a mere messenger (rasūl), how does divine permission extend to acts of prostration toward him by creation? Is this not in contradiction withSurah 41:37which states,“Do not prostrate to the sun or to the moon, but prostrate to Allah who created them.”Was Aisha mistaken or fabricating?As the Prophet’s wife, Aisha’s report holds significant authority in Islamic tradition. However, if the Hadith implies the Prophet accepted worship (even passively), it undermines the Qur’anic command inSurah 18:110:“Say, I am only a human being like you, to whom it has been revealed that your God is one God.”If Aisha’s account is authentic, then it portrays Muhammad in a position of divinity rather than prophethood.Exegetical Tension: Worship vs. HonorThe Prophet’s response—“Worship your Lord and honor your brother”—appears to distance himself from direct worship. Yet, the narrative fails to address why the camel and trees were permitted to perform prostration. The Companions’ statement,“Beasts and trees prostrate before you, but we have the greatest right to do so,”reveals that even early Muslims perceived this as an act ofveneration, if not worship.This suggests an early tendency towardprophetic exaltation, later seen inShama’il al-Muhammadiyyahand Sufi traditions where Muhammad is described as the “Light of Creation” (Nūr Muḥammadī). The narrative, therefore, exposes an evolving theology that blurs the line between devotion to Allah and reverence for His messenger.Philosophical and Theological ImplicationsFrom a theological standpoint, the Hadith leads to a paradox:If the beasts and trees truly worshipped Muhammad,shirkwas committed.If they did not, the Hadith contradicts its own narrative, rendering itmythological or metaphorical.Either outcome undermines the integrity of Hadith transmission or Islamic theology of pure monotheism.Furthermore, this account echoesancient pagan reverencewhere nature worshipped semi-divine heroes and kings—suggesting the possiblesyncretic incorporationof earlier cultural myths into Hadith literature.ConclusionThe Hadith of Aisha (al-Tirmidhi 3270) remains a profound theological problem within Islamic orthodoxy. It implies that Muhammad received a form of worship from creation, contradicting the Qur’an’s uncompromising monotheism. Whether this account is allegorical or literal, it exposes atension between prophetic humanity and divine exaltationin early Islamic narratives. The narration attributed to Aisha thus becomes a critical text for examiningthe evolution of Muhammad’s deificationin post-Qur’anic traditions.BibliographyAl-Tirmidhi, Abu Isa Muhammad ibn Isa.Jamiʿ al-Tirmidhi, Hadith 3270.Ahmad ibn Hanbal.Musnad Ahmad, Vol. 6, Hadith No. 25512.The Qur’an, Surah 18:110; 21:98–99; 22:18; 41:37.Ibn Kathir, Ismail.Tafsir al-Qur’an al-Azim.Dar al-Fikr, Beirut, 1998.Al-Bukhari, Muhammad ibn Ismail.Sahih al-Bukhari.Crone, Patricia.Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam.Princeton University Press, 1987.Wansbrough, John.Quranic Studies: Sources and Methods of Scriptural Interpretation.Oxford University Press, 1977.Shimba, Maxwell.Theological Paradoxes in Islamic Texts: A Comparative Inquiry.Shimba Theological Institute Press, 2025.",

The study: (1) presents the textual evidence; (2) surveys classical and contemporary Sunni explanations; (3) analyses the charge that such reports imply animals/trees “committed shirk” and therefore will be condemned (Q 21:98–99); (4) discusses the normative status of the narrators (Aisha and the Companions) and whether accusing them of lying is warranted; and (5) offers concluding remarks and avenues for further research. Key primary and secondary sources are cited.1. The primary text (presentation)The narration commonly cited is recorded in Jāmi‘ at-Tirmidhī (no. 3270) and in other collections: the Arabic and translations give the gist that Aisha narrated an occasion when “a camel came and prostrated itself before him [the Prophet];” the Companions exclaimed that beasts and trees prostrate before him, and the Prophet replied: “Worship your Lord and honour your brother. If I were to order anyone to prostrate himself before another, I would have ordered a woman to prostrate before her husband…” (translation summary). The hadith appears in Tirmidhī’s chapter on tafsīr and has parallel reports in other works. (Sunnah.com)2. Immediate theological problem stated by the questionerThe user raises two linked difficulties:If animals and trees prostrate before the Prophet, does that amount to worship of the Prophet (shirk), and are those creatures therefore condemned with their “lord” (the Prophet) to Hell as implied by a literal reading of Q 21:98–99?Given that this hadith is narrated by Aisha (and that Companions reportedly affirmed animals/trees prostrating), is it legitimate to suspect falsehood (i.e., were Aisha/the Companions lying against the Prophet)?These are serious theological questions that demand careful textual, doctrinal, and hermeneutical analysis rather than polemical leaps.3. Scholarly and traditional Muslim responses (summary and analysis)3.1 On the authenticity and transmission of the narrationThe report appears in Tirmidhī and other compendia and is discussed by hadith scholars. Some chains place the report in collections such as Musnad Ahmad as well. Classical hadith-cataloguers and later scholars have examined the chains and text (matn) when grading the report. Different transmitters and parallel versions exist; hence scholars discuss its status and variant readings. (Sunnah.com)3.2 On the meaning of animals/trees “prostrating”Muslim exegetical and juridical tradition offers several interpretive options:Literal miraculous submission (miracle): Some scholars accept the report as describing a miraculous instance — animals and creation sometimes manifest submission to God through extraordinary acts when God wills it — but they emphasize that such submission is not equivalent toworship of the Prophet. The miracle would demonstrate the Prophet’s special status and God’s control over creation, not that the creatures redirected their worship from God to a created being. (See classical tafsīr and hadith commentaries treating miraculous signs of the prophets.) (Sunnah.com)Phenomenological/figurative reading: Other exegetes read such narrations as figurative or hyperbolic — reporting the companions’ impression that “even beasts show submission,” meaning the environment’s calmness, the camel’s unusual behavior, or exaggerated speech of bystanders, rather than a literal ritual prostration implying liturgical worship of the Prophet. This avoids theological conflict with tawḥīd (divine unity). (ResearchGate)Narrative variants and context-sensitive reading: Some hadith variants omit explicit wording that would imply worship of the Prophet; scholars caution against drawing universal doctrines from singular, potentially ambiguous reports. The Prophet’s own reply in the narration — “Worship your Lord and honor your brother” and the clear rejection of instructing people to prostrate to him — is often treated as an internal corrective that prevents a reading that the Prophet accepted prostration to himself. This self-correction in the report is decisive for mainstream Sunni theology. (IslamWeb)3.3 On the Qur’anic verses (Q 21:98–99) the questioner citesQuran 21:98–99 reads in standard translations along the lines: “Verily you (disbelievers) and your partners — the things you used to worship besides God — are the fuel of Hell. Surely you will enter it.” Classical tafsīr notes that the verses warn idolaters that both people and the objects of their worship are (figuratively) fuel for Hell. Commentators discuss apparent paradoxes (e.g., what about prophets or angels who may have been venerated) and explain thatthose who accept and promote being worshipped instead of Godare culpable — if anyone (human, angel, or object) were to claim or accept worship in place of God, that one would share in the accountability of those who worshipped them. Tafsīr literature often quotes reports where the Prophet explains that anyone who accepts worship will be liable alongside those who worshipped them. Thus exegetes harmonize the Qur’anic text with reports of admiration or even veneration by clarifying that veneration must not be formal worship or obedience that contradicts tawḥīd. (My Islam)4. Does the hadith imply shirk by animals/trees or the Prophet? (analysis)A careful, historically sensitive answer requires separating levels of meaning:Prostration vs. worship: In the Islamic normative system,prostration as ritual worship (sujūd ibādah)is strictly for God. The Prophet himself explicitly forbade prostrating to anyone other than Allah and rebuked any attempt to ascribe divine status to him. The hadith’s internal dynamics (the companions’ comment and the Prophet’s corrective reply) support the interpretation that the event—if literal—was a sign from God and not an invitation to worship the Prophet as deity. Thus the mainstream Sunni response is that the narration does not imply shirk on the Prophet’s part nor legitimate worship of the Prophet by creatures. (IslamWeb)Quranic compatibility: The Qur’an’s warning (21:98–99) that “you and what you worship besides God will be fuel for Hell” targetsthose who designate or accept rivals to God’s worship. Classical tafsīr reconciles apparent difficulties by reporting prophetic clarifications: if any created being were to accept or command worship, then that being would share in the moral responsibility (not that animals by nature will be judged the same as rational agents). Many exegetes emphasize moral agency as the determinant of culpability — animals, lacking moral agency, are not morally culpable in the same way humans are. Thus equating a miraculous animal action with intentional shirk is not required by the Qur’an and is rejected by most tafsīrists. (My Islam)5. Were Aisha and the Companions “lying against the Prophet”? — methodological cautionFrom a scholarly perspective:Traditional Sunni stance: Aisha (radiyallāhu ‘anha) and the Companions are accorded high credibility in Sunni hadith methodology. Alleging deliberate fabrication (kadhb) against such central figures requires extraordinary evidence. Scholarly practice examines chains (isnād) and variants, and when problems appear, scholars discuss weakness (da‘f), mis-transmission, or interpretive scope — not immediate moral accusation. Primary hadith criticism treats reliability and variant forms as the method to resolve tension. (Sunnah.com)Alternative critical academic approaches: Modern historical-critical scholarship may treat such narratives as historically situated reports that reflect later community memory, rhetorical devices, or hagiographic motifs. Such scholarship may propose non-literal readings or regard some narrations as later embellishments. These approaches are methodological and do not necessarily accuse narrators of intentional falsehood; rather, they analyze how oral transmission, redaction, and communal memory shaped the corpus. (See research on the formation of hadith literature and thematic motifs.) (ResearchGate)Conclusion on this question: There is no scholarly warrant in mainstream Sunni tradition to allege that Aisha or the Companions were lying about the event. Debates focus on the precise meaning, the chain strength, and theological implications, not on imputing moral corruption to foundational narrators.6. Practical reading guide (how to read this material responsibly)Text first, context second: Read the hadith text and parallel variants; examine chains (isnād) and whether it appears in multiple collections. (Sunnah.com)Consult tafsīr and hadith commentary: Scholars—classical and contemporary—offer reconciliations (miracle vs. figurative vs. weak report). Compare authoritative tafsīr and fatwā literature for how the Qur’anic verses and hadith are harmonized. (My Islam)Avoid immediate theological leaps: Distinguish between descriptive reports (an animal’s extraordinary behavior) and prescriptive theology (the legitimacy of worship). The Prophet’s own corrective phrases in the report are a strong internal theological safeguard. (IslamWeb)7.

Cross-tradition comparison could illuminate communal memory and polemics.An empirical philological study of lexical range: what did “prostration” (sujūd) mean in various Arabian rhetorical registers, and could non-ritual uses account for some narrational idioms?8. Concluding summaryThe hadith about a camel prostrating before the Prophet is attested in the classical collections (e.g., Tirmidhī) though variant chains and texts exist; scholars have debated readings and grades. (Sunnah.com)Mainstream Sunni readings do not conclude that animals or trees committed shirk in the moral-agent sense, nor that the Prophet accepted being worshipped. The Prophet’s reported corrective reply in the same narration reinforces the doctrine of tawḥīd (only God is to be worshipped).

(ResearchGate)Short final answer to the user’s explicit questionsWhy did Allah permit beasts and trees to prostrate before His final prophet? — Classical Muslim readings that accept the narration understand such extraordinary events as signs of God’s power and the Prophet’s special station; they do not read the event as implying that animals thereby committed shirk or that the Prophet accepted being an object of worship. Other readings treat the report as figurative or as a later narrative embellishment. (See Tirmidhī and tafsīr discussions.) (Sunnah.com)Was Aisha and the Companions lying against their prophet? — On the evidence and by standard Sunni methodological practice, there is no warrant to accuse Aisha or the Companions of deliberate falsehood. Difficulties are handled by textual and chain criticism and by theological harmonization, not by imputing fabrication to primary narrators.

The creature’s submission was by Allah’s command, so no element of shirk is contained in it.”2.Prostration Prohibited in IslamThe Prophet’s response — “Worship your Lord and honor your brother” — serves as atheological correction:The Companions’ enthusiasm could have led to confusion betweenrespectandworship.The Prophet clarified thatonly Allahis to be worshipped, and that all forms of prostration (sujūd) before creatures areforbiddenin Islam.By saying,“If I were to order anyone to prostrate before anyone else…”, he used arhetorical conditional— not to command such an act, but toemphasize the great right of a husband over his wife.3.Historical and Theological ContextSujūd at-taḥiyyah(prostration of greeting) existed among previous nations — for instance, Joseph’s brothers bowed before him (Qur’an 12:100).Islamabrogatedthat custom, replacing physical prostration with verbal salutation (salām).Therefore, when an animal or tree “prostrated,” it symbolizedrecognition of the Prophet’s status, notworshipof him.As Ibn al-‘Arabī notes in‘Āriḍat al-Aḥwadhī:“This act was extraordinary — a miracle (mu‘jizah) — demonstrating creation’s obedience to the Messenger by God’s will, not a sign of the Prophet’s divinity.”4.Refutation of the Shirk Allegation (Theological Analysis)The questioner’s claim — that if beasts and trees prostrate before Muhammad, they commit shirk (polytheism) — fails under Islamic theology because:Animals and inanimate objects lack moral agency (taklīf)and cannot “commit” shirk.The Qur’an states that“to Allah prostrates whatever is in the heavens and the earth”(Qur’an 16:49–50; 22:18).Hence, when creation “prostrates,” it signifiesuniversal submission to Allah, not worship of intermediaries.The Prophet explicitly forbade being prostrated to, thus affirming his pure monotheism.5.Summary of Scholarly Consensus (Ijma‘)AspectScholarly ViewReferencesNature of prostrationMiracle or sign, not worshipTuhfat al-Aḥwadhī, vol. 9, p. 370Theological implicationNo shirk; total submission under divine commandIbn al-‘Arabī, ‘Āriḍat al-Aḥwadhī, vol. 6Legal rulingSujūd to anyone besides Allah is ḥarām in IslamFiqh al-Sunnah, al-Sayyid SabiqSymbolic meaningDemonstration of Prophet’s honor and divine missionAl-Qastallānī, al-Mawāhib al-Ladunniyyah6.ConclusionThe classical scholars unanimously hold that:Thecamel’s prostrationwas amiracle (mu‘jizah)granted by Allah to demonstrate the Prophet’s rank.TheCompanions’ remark(“Beasts and trees prostrate to you”) expressed amazement, not theological assertion.TheProphet’s correctionreaffirmedtawḥīd— the exclusive worship of Allah.Therefore, neither Muhammad, nor the animals, nor the trees committed or acceptedshirkin this event.Academic Reference ListAl-Tirmidhī,Jāmi‘ al-Sunan, no. 3270 (Book of Birr wa-Ṣilah).Al-Mubārakfūrī,Tuhfat al-Aḥwadhī bi-Sharḥ Jāmi‘ al-Tirmidhī, vol. 9 (Beirut: Dār al-Kutub al-‘Ilmiyyah, 1979), pp. 370–372.Ibn al-‘Arabī,‘Āriḍat al-Aḥwadhī, vol. 6.Al-Qastallānī,al-Mawāhib al-Ladunniyyah fī Manāqib an-Nubuwwah, vol. 3.Sayyid Sābiq,Fiqh al-Sunnah, vol. 2.Qur’an 2:34, 12:100, 16:49–50, 22:18.",

    "full_content": "Abraham Never Built the Kaʿbah — A Scholarly ExaminationBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba — Shimba Theological InstituteAbstract (short).This article examines the widely held Islamic tradition that Abraham (Ibrāhīm) and his son Ismāʿīl built the Kaʿbah in Mecca, and it evaluates six assertions commonly made in Christian critiques: (1) Abraham never visited Mecca; (2) Abraham did not build the Black Stone nor did it fall from the sky in the manner commonly described in later tradition; (3) Abraham made altars opposite a sacred stone but not the Kaʿbah as known in Islamic tradition; (4) the “Valley of Baca” (Psa lm 84) is not identical with Bakka/Makkah; (5) the “pilgrimage” language in Psalm 84 is not a reference to Hajj at the Kaʿbah; and (6) the well where Hagar found water in Genesis is not necessarily the Zamzam of Mecca. The evidence shows that the Abraham–Kaʿbah connection is a powerful and ancienttraditionwithin Islam, but it is not independently attested by contemporary extra-Qurʾānic sources or archaeology in a way that would confirm the historicist claims made in later communal memory. Where the sources are ambiguous or interpretive, this paper exposes the contested nature of the identifications and recommends careful, cautious conclusions.IntroductionMuslim tradition presents the Kaʿbah as the primeval “House” associated with Adam and later rebuilt by Abraham and Ismāʿīl (Qurʾānic formulation: “when Abraham and Ismail raised the foundations of the House…”). This narrative is doctrinally central within Islam and embedded in ritual memory (tawāf, Hajj rites, the place of Maqām Ibrāhīm, Zamzam, the Black Stone). Yet from the perspective of historical-critical inquiry, the claim that Abraham physically visited Mecca and (re)constructed the Kaʿbah in the Hejaz requires external corroboration — textual, epigraphic, or archaeological — which is thin or absent. The following sections analyse the evidence and alternative readings.1. Tradition versus independent historical evidenceClaim.Abraham never visited Mecca (no independent historical evidence he did).Evidence & argument.The Qurʾān and Islamic tradition clearly attribute the raising/rebuilding of the Kaʿbah to Abraham and Ismāʿīl; however, secular historical and archaeological surveys note the paucity of contemporaneous (e.g., Near Eastern, Byzantine, or South Arabian) records that tie Abraham — a patriarchal figure of the second/third millennium BCE in Biblical chronology — to the Hejaz sanctuary. Modern reference works summarise both the Islamic tradition and the relative lack of independent evidence for a pre-Islamic Kaʿbah founded by Abraham in the exact form described by later Muslim exegesis. (Encyclopedia Britannica)Conclusion:The Abrahamic origin of the Kaʿbah is a theological/traditional claim with strong internal attestation in Islamic literature; it lacks external, datable archaeological corroboration that would demonstrate a historical, physical act by Abraham in Mecca.2. The Black Stone: tradition, later legend, and uncertain originClaim.Abraham never built the Black Stone from the sky; origin stories vary and are not historically verifiable.Evidence & argument.Islamic tradition recounts several origins for the Black Stone (al-Hajar al-Aswad): meteorite, relic from Adam, an angel turned to stone, etc. Medieval and later writers record these traditions, and modern commentators add geological speculation (some propose meteoritic origin). However, the stone has never been subjected to definitive modern scientific analysis (for obvious religious and political reasons), and scholarly treatments emphasise that accounts of celestial origin are traditions, not scientific proof. (Wikipedia)Conclusion:The Black Stone’s “from the sky” narrative belongs to devotional tradition and later apologetic exegesis; it cannot be treated as a historically established fact without independent physical analysis and corroboration.3. Abraham’s altars and the possibility of ritual sites distinct from the KaʿbahClaim.Abraham built altars to offer sacrifices opposite a stone, but this should not be conflated automatically with the later Kaʿbah structure in Mecca.Evidence & argument.Islamic exegetical tradition sometimes locates early patriarchal sanctities (altars, stations of prayer) within a broader sacred geography attributed to Abraham. Early texts and later tafsīr narrate that Abraham found the Black Stone and (re)established a sanctuary; yet these retellings function to sacralise the Meccan shrine and properly integrate it into Abrahamic lineage. From the historian’s viewpoint, such narrative moves are common in religious traditions that link local shrines to revered ancestors. Comparative scholarship treats such reports as theological legitimations rather than independent chronicles of construction works. (Encyclopedia Britannica)Conclusion:References to altars and sacrifices associated with Abraham are important for devotional history but do not demonstrate a straightforward archaeological claim that ties Abraham physically to the extant Kaʿbah complex.4. The Valley of Baca (Baka/Bakkah) — biblical text and identificationsClaim.The valley of Baca in Psalm 84 is not (demonstrably) the Valley of Mecca/Bakkah.Evidence & argument.Psalm 84 (a pilgrimage psalm) uses the Hebrew termBaca(בכא/“baká( )”/“weeping” or “balsam”), typically understood in Jewish and Christian exegesis as a local valley in or near ancient Israel (possible identifications include the Valley of Rephaim or others). Islamic interpreters read the QurʾānicBakkah(Q 3:96) as Mecca and some Muslim exegetes connect Psalmic language to Mecca retrospectively. Secular and revisionist scholars (e.g., Tom Holland; and various source-critical authors) point out that the HebrewBakhaand ArabicBakkahare separate lexical items and that identification of the Psalm’s valley with Mecca is not linguistically or historically compelled. The scholarly literature therefore treats the identification as speculative, often motivated by theological correlation rather than direct evidence. (Bible Hub)Conclusion:Psalm 84’s “Valley of Baca” is best read in its immediate canonical and Israelite setting; linking it to Mecca requires assumptions that go beyond the biblical text and into comparative theological reading.5. Psalm 84 and the idea of “pilgrimage” — not HajjClaim.The pilgrimage language in Psalm 84 is not description of the Islamic Hajj to the Kaʿbah.Evidence & argument.Psalm 84 is part of the Israelite pilgrimage/temple psalmody tradition (pilgrimage to Zion, the Temple). Its language — “blessed are those who dwell in your house… they journey from strength to strength” — is framed by Israelite cultic practice and geography (Jerusalem/Zion). While some modern readers attempt to read Psalm 84 typologically vis-à-vis later pilgrimage forms (including Hajj), the historical context and the Israelite cultic horizon make a direct identification with Hajj or the Kaʿbah anachronistic. (Explore the Bible)Conclusion:The Psalm is best explained within Israelite cultic-pilgrimage imagination; equating it to Hajj represents a theological reading, not an exegesis grounded in the Psalm’s own historical setting.6. Hagar, Ishmael, and the water: Zamzam vs. Genesis wellsClaim.The water associated with Hagar in Genesis is not necessarily the Zamzam well of Mecca.Evidence & argument.Genesis 21:14–21 recounts Hagar and Ishmael in the wilderness, God opening a well (Hebrewmiqweh/ma‘in), and their survival. Islamic tradition locates a parallel event at Mecca (Zamzam), and later Islamic historiography identifies the site and ritualises Safa–Marwah and the well. The narratives have similar motifs (divine water for the abandoned child), but the Genesis narrative is set in the Negev/Beersheba or surrounding region (patriarchal south of Canaan), and there is no explicit biblical geography of Mecca. The tradition that equates the Genesis well with Zamzam is thus an inter-religious identification that post-dates the biblical text and belongs to the Islamic sacred-historical mapping of Abrahamic memory onto the Hejaz. (Wikipedia)Conclusion:The shared motifs do not by themselves prove identity of locations; the Genesis text does not mention Mecca or Zamzam.7. Summary and balanced assessmentStrong internal tradition.Islamic texts (Qurʾān and hadīth corpus; classical tafsīr) and continuous devotional practice robustly affirm Abraham’s role vis-à-vis the Kaʿbah, the Black Stone, Zamzam, and the sanctity of Makkah/Bakkah. This is the baseline of Muslim belief and community memory. (Encyclopedia Britannica)Lack of independent, contemporary corroboration.From a historical-critical vantage point, there is no external contemporaneous record (Near Eastern inscriptions, Byzantine or South Arabian records) that corroborates in detail an act of Abrahamian construction in the Hejaz; archaeological evidence for a continuous, datable structure back to the patriarchal era is not available. Scholarly literature accordingly distinguishes tradition from verifiable history. (Oxford Bibliographies)Textual-linguistic caution.The HebrewBaca/Bakhaand ArabicBakkahare similar-looking to modern readers but have distinct philological histories; mapping Psalmic valleys to Mecca requires methodological caution and additional positive evidence. (Wikipedia)Tradition as identity-forming narrative.The Abraham–Kaʿbah tradition is a powerful identity and legitimating narrative. Its religious force is real even where extra-Islamic historical verification is not forthcoming. Recognising this helps explain why the tradition persists and is authoritative for Muslims even in the absence of corroborating archaeological data.Annex — Selected verses and texts (for reference)QurʾānSurah 3 (Āl-ʿImrān) : 96— “Verily, the first House (of worship) appointed for mankind was that at Bakkah (Makkah), full of blessing, and a guidance for mankind.” (common translations).

(Smarthistory)Final remarks (tone of scholarly civility)If the goal is to persuade Muslim readers, scholars of religion and inter-faith dialogue recommend an approach that recognises the theological centrality of the Abrahamic accountfor believerswhile carefully differentiating faith-claims from externally verifiable historical claims. The evidence above shows that: (a) the Abraham–Kaʿbah tradition is authoritative within Islamic historiography and ritual; (b) it is not matched by contemporaneous extra-Qurʾānic documentation or unambiguous archaeological proof; and (c) several identifications (Valley of Baca → Mecca; Genesis well → Zamzam) are interpretive overlays rather than necessary textual conclusions. For readers committed to historical-critical method, the prudent position is: treat these astradition-ladenclaims, strong within their religious contexts, but historicallycontestedwhen tested by external historical criteria.If you wish, I can now:Convert this into a fully referenced academic paper (Chicago or Turabian style) with footnotes and fuller bibliographic entries;orProduce an annotated bibliography with direct quotes and primary-source excerpts (Qurʾān, tafsīr excerpts, select hadiths, Genesis/Psalm manuscript notes);orDraft a concise op-ed version targeted at interfaith readers summarising the argument in plain language.The Later Construction of the Abraham–Mecca Tradition: A Historical and Textual InvestigationBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba — Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThe Islamic narrative that Abraham (Ibrāhīm) and his son Ishmael built the Kaʿbah in Mecca is foundational to Islamic belief and ritual practice. However, when examined through the lens of historical-critical scholarship, it becomes clear that this tradition developed long after the biblical and even pre-Islamic periods. No pre-Islamic source—biblical, extra-biblical, or archaeological—links Abraham to Mecca, the Kaʿbah, or the Black Stone. This paper exposes the anachronistic nature of the Meccan-Abrahamic connection, tracing its evolution within Islamic historiography and contrasting it with the Biblical record of Abraham’s life and geography.1. Absence of Abrahamic Geography in ArabiaThe Hebrew Bible situates Abraham’s life primarily betweenMesopotamia (Ur and Haran)andCanaan (Hebron, Bethel, Beersheba). These sites are geographically located within the Fertile Crescent, hundreds of kilometers north of the Arabian Hejaz.Genesis 12:5–8situates Abraham’s journey from Ur to Canaan, where he built altars atShechemandBethel.Genesis 13:18places him atHebron, where he built another altar to Yahweh.Genesis 21:33places him inBeersheba, in southern Canaan.No biblical passage places Abraham in Arabia, let alone in Mecca. Thearchaeological and cultural horizonof the patriarchal narratives aligns with theLevantine–Mesopotamian corridor, not the barren Hejaz desert.Early Jewish and Christian sources—such asPhilo of Alexandria,Josephus, and theBook of Jubilees—also confine Abraham’s activity to the same geographical zone. These writings predate Islam by more than six centuries and containno reference to Mecca or a shrine in Arabia.Conclusion:The Abraham–Mecca connection is entirely absent from ancient Jewish, Christian, and Near Eastern literature prior to the rise of Islam in the 7th century CE.2. The Kaʿbah in Pre-Islamic Arabia: Pagan Sanctuary, Not Abrahamic ShrineArchaeological and historical sources agree that theKaʿbah was a polytheistic sanctuarybefore Islam. Pre-Islamic Arabs housedidols of 360 deitiesinside the Kaʿbah, including Hubal, al-Lāt, al-‘Uzzā, and Manāt.Ibn al-Kalbī’sKitāb al-Aṣnām(Book of Idols)describes the Kaʿbah as the center of idol worship long before Muhammad’s lifetime.Greek historian Diodorus Siculus (1st century BCE)mentions a temple revered by Arabs, likely Mecca, but he makesno reference to Abraham or monotheism.There isno archaeological layeror inscription in Mecca dating back to the 2nd millennium BCE (Abraham’s supposed era) or even the early Iron Age.Conclusion:The Kaʿbah’s early history is rooted inArabian paganism, not Abrahamic monotheism. The Abrahamic association is alater theological reconstructionrather than an historical memory.3. The Emergence of the Abraham–Mecca Narrative in Islamic LiteratureTheQurʾān (2:127; 3:96)mentions Abraham and Ishmael “raising the foundations of the House” and calls Mecca “Bakkah.” However, the Qurʾān offersno historical detail, no mention of building materials, and no geographical proof.Earlybiographical sources (Sīrah and Ḥadīth)—compiled 150–250 years after Muhammad—expand the story dramatically:The Kaʿbah was allegedly built by Abraham and Ishmael.TheBlack Stonedescended from heaven.TheZamzam wellmiraculously appeared for Hagar and Ishmael.The Hajj pilgrimage was instituted by Abraham.Yet, these reports are foundonly in later Islamic compilations, such asIbn Isḥāq (d. 767 CE)andal-Ṭabarī (d. 923 CE)—centuries after the events they describe.Historical-critical scholars such asPatricia CroneandMichael Cook(Hagarism, 1977), andTom Holland(In the Shadow of the Sword, 2012), argue that the Abrahamic connection to Mecca was aretroactive theological inventionto link Islam with the Abrahamic covenant and legitimize the Arabian sanctuary as part of sacred history.Conclusion:The Abraham–Kaʿbah narrativedid not exist in the 1st or 2nd centuries BCE/CEandemerged only in post-Qurʾānic tradition, centuries after Abraham’s supposed lifetime.4. The Valley of Baca (Psalm 84) and Bakkah (Qurʾān 3:96): False Linguistic ParallelsMuslim apologists often identify the “Valley of Baca” inPsalm 84:6with the “Bakkah” of the Qurʾān. However, linguistic and contextual analysis refutes this link:The Hebrew wordבכא (bakhaʾ)means “weeping” or “balsam trees.” It describes avalley of tears or difficultyalong thepilgrimage to Zion (Jerusalem).The context of Psalm 84 clearly refers topilgrims journeying to the Temple in Jerusalem(“They go from strength to strength till each appears before God in Zion,” v.7).There is no geographical or textual connection toMeccaorArabia.Thus, the “Valley of Baca” isa poetic symbolin Israelite worship, not a reference to the Arabian “Bakkah.”5. Hagar’s Well and the Myth of ZamzamGenesis 21:14–21recounts that Hagar wandered in the wilderness ofBeersheba, not Mecca, and that God opened her eyes to a nearby well. The location is clearly within thesouthern Levant, not the Arabian Peninsula.Islamic tradition later transferred this story to Mecca, identifying the miraculous well asZamzam, near the Kaʿbah. Yet, this is ageographical and chronological displacementof the biblical narrative. There is no record—Jewish, Christian, or otherwise—of Hagar or Ishmael settling in Mecca.Conclusion:The association between Hagar’s well and Zamzam is alater adaptationto situate the Abrahamic lineage within Arabia and give the Kaʿbah a biblical ancestry.6. The Function of the Abraham–Kaʿbah Myth in Islamic TheologyThe Abraham–Mecca story served astrategic theological purpose:It gave Islam adirect Abrahamic lineage, connecting Muhammad’s message to biblical monotheism.It redefinedArab identityas heirs of Abraham through Ishmael.It transformed apagan sanctuaryinto thecenter of monotheistic worship, rebranded as the “House of God.”This narrative legitimized Mecca as the new Jerusalem and Islam as the final revelation. However, from a historical standpoint, it is aconstruct of post-biblical, post-apostolic traditionrather than a record of ancient events.7. ConclusionThere isno historical, archaeological, or linguistic evidencethat Abraham ever visited Mecca or built the Kaʿbah.All data—biblical, extra-biblical, and material—place Abraham far from Arabia.The Islamic version of events emergedcenturies after both Abraham and Muhammad, forming part of a theological rebranding that sanctified Mecca as the heart of Islam.The Abraham–Kaʿbah connection thus stands as alate mythological development, not an ancient historical reality.Select BibliographyCrone, Patricia, and Michael Cook.Hagarism: The Making of the Islamic World.

The wordkafiriexisted in Scripture centuries before the Arabs of the 7th century (such as Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, and Ali) emerged as followers of Islam.Thus, Muslims merelyfound the word already in useamong the people who read and taught from the Holy Bible.In fact, nowhere in the Qur’an are Christians calledkafirs(infidels). Rather, the Qur’an describes Christians asthose who fear God and are learned(Surat al-Ma’idah 5:82).To confirm that the wordkafiriis biblical, let us examine several scriptural references.Biblical References to the Word “Infidel”Ezekiel 34:28–31– God Himself assures Israel that they shall no longer be prey to theinfidels(the nations).Nehemiah 5:8–9; 5:17; 6:16Lamentations 1:3; 1:10; 5:21 Timothy 1:8–11Jude 1:41 John 4:1–6These texts demonstrate that the term “infidel” or “unbeliever” was in uselong before Muhammad’s birth, before the Qur’an was written, and before the rise of Islam.The Meaning and Use of “Kafiri”The wordkafiriis Arabic and literally means“a rejecter” or “one who opposes.”In other words, it refers to a person whorejects or opposes the word of God.Whenever there is an initial divine statement (apreceding statement), and a later person or doctrine contradicts it, the contradictor becomes akafiri—a rejecter of divine truth.Today, Muslims often refer to Christians askafirs, saying, “These infidels trouble us” or “Let us fight the infidels.” But biblically and historically, that accusation is misplaced.Questions for ReflectionBetweenChristiansandMuslims, who truly fits the description ofkafiri(one who rejects divine truth)?BetweenChristian faithandIslam, which came first in history?BetweenJesus ChristandMuhammad, who contradicted the other’s teaching?A Brief Historical Context: Jesus and MuhammadJesus Christ is thefounder of the Christian faith.According toHebrews 12:2, He is “the author and finisher of our faith.”It has been over2,000 years (since A.D. 33)since Jesus ascended into heaven, while the Islamic calendar (Hijri year 1436 at the time of writing) begins with Muhammad’s movement centuries later. Muhammad was born aroundA.D. 570—well after the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus.Therefore,Jesus and the Christian message preceded Muhammad and Islam.The teachings of Jesus are thepreceding (original) statements, while Muhammad’s later assertions arecontradictory statements—making them, by definition,kafiri(opposing truths).The Foundational Christian Statement: Jesus is the Son of GodInJohn 9:35–38, Jesus Himself declares that He isthe Son of God.This is an original divine claim—apreceding statement.If any later teaching declares, “Jesus is not the Son of God,” that is acontradictory statement—an act of rejection of divine revelation—and thus the speaker is, by definition, akafiri.Who First Declared That Jesus Is the Son of God?According toLuke 1:26–35, it was not a human being who first called Jesus the Son of God, butGod Himself, speaking through the angelGabriel.This declaration is confirmed again in:Matthew 3:13–17– At Jesus’ baptism, the Father declares, “This is my beloved Son.”Matthew 17:1–5– At the Transfiguration, the same divine voice affirms the Sonship of Jesus.These are divinepreceding statements, proclaimed by God long before Muhammad’s birth (A.D. 570) or the beginning of Islam (A.D. 610).Therefore, when the Qur’an or any Islamic teaching denies that Jesus is the Son of God, such denialopposes God’s original declarationand falls under the biblical definition ofkafiri—a rejecter of divine truth.The First Infidel in the WorldWhen God created humanity, He gave a clear command:Genesis 2:16–17– “You must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will certainly die.”This is theoriginal divine statement.But then the serpent contradicted God, saying:Genesis 3:1–4– “You will not certainly die.”Here, the serpent (Satan) directly opposed God’s word—makingSatan the first infidel (kafiri)in the world.Thus, anyone who rejects God’s revelation—such as denying that Jesus is the Son of God—aligns with the same spirit of rebellion as Satan and becomes akafiri.The Qur’an’s ContradictionThe Qur’an states inSurat al-An‘am 6:101:“He is the Creator of the heavens and the earth. How can He have a son when He has no wife?”This verse misunderstands the divine nature, reducing it to human reasoning. It assumes that God needs a physical wife to have a Son—an anthropomorphic limitation foreign to biblical theology.TheBible, however, teaches that believers are children of Godnot by flesh or blood, but by faith and divine adoption (John 1:12–13).Hence, the Qur’anic viewopposesthe earlier divine revelation and becomes, by biblical definition, akafiristatement.Children of God vs. Children of the Devil1 John 3:10declares:“In this the children of God and the children of the devil are manifest.”Those who reject their identity as children of God demonstrate spiritual parentage under the devil.Similarly, Islamic tradition (Hadith Sahih Muslim, Vol. 4) refers to Muhammad’s wives as“Ummul Mu’minin”—theMothers of the Faithful.But does calling them “mothers” literally mean they gave birth to all Muslims? Of course not.This exposes the inconsistency of literalizing divine sonship while metaphorically interpreting human motherhood in Islam.ConclusionChristianitypredatesIslam.Therefore, Islamic doctrines thatopposethe preexisting truths of the Gospel are, by theological and historical definition,kafiri—rejections of divine revelation.Consequently,Islam, Allah, Muhammad, and Jibril (Gabriel)—by their denial of Jesus’ divine Sonship—stand in contradiction to the Word of God and thus fall under the biblical category ofkafiri(infidels).Reflect deeply—and take a stand for truth.May you be blessed abundantly.Dr. Max ShimbaServant of Jesus Christ, the Great God (Titus 2:13)",

    "full_content": "Was Adam’s First Created Organ His Genitalia? A Theological Debate and Challenge to Islamic AnthropologyBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute, Orlando, FloridaAbstractThis academic debate paper challenges an Islamic narration that claims the first organ created in Adam was his genital organ (dhakari). The discussion examines the logical, theological, and moral implications of this claim, its sources in Islamic literature, and its inconsistency with divine transcendence. Through critical questioning, the article invites scholars of comparative religion to reconsider how Islamic anthropological narratives align—or conflict—with the nature and holiness of God as understood in biblical revelation.IntroductionIn certain Islamic sources, it is alleged thatthe very first organ created in Adam was his male organ.This claim originates from traditional narrations attributed to the Prophet Muhammad, as cited inKitabu cha Mkweli Mwaminifu(The Book of the Truthful Believer), Volumes 3 and 4, 18th Edition (1432 A.H. / 2011). According to this narration, the Prophet is quoted as saying:“The first thing created in the body of Adam (peace be upon him) was his private part. Then it was said to him: ‘O Adam, this is a trust; do not use it except in the place where you are commanded.’”The theological implications of this narration are profound and problematic. If Allah truly created Adam’s sexual organ before his head, brain, heart, or soul, then what does this say about divine wisdom, purpose, and moral order?This article presents ascholarly debatechallenging the internal coherence and divine logic behind this Islamic claim.Debate I: The Order of Creation — Logic or Absurdity?Question 1:Why would Allah create the genital organ before creating Adam’s mind, heart, or soul?Creation, according to all rational and theological principles, follows divine order and purpose. The human reproductive organ serves a social and biological function; it cannot exist meaningfully apart from the body, consciousness, or moral responsibility. Thus, creating it first renders it purposeless.Question 2:What function could Adam’s genital organ serve before the rest of his body existed?An organ without a body cannot fulfill reproductive, aesthetic, or moral functions. The claim collapses into absurdity when viewed biologically or philosophically.Question 3:Does this narration suggest that Allah’s creative priority was sexual rather than spiritual?If the first creative act in humanity was focused on sexuality rather than intellect or spirit, what does this imply about Allah’s priorities and understanding of holiness?In contrast, the Bible presents a coherent order of creation rooted in divine image and reason:“Then the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life” (Genesis 2:7).Debate II: Theological Contradictions in Divine NatureQuestion 4:Where was Adam’s organ placed after its creation, and for how long did it exist before the rest of his body was formed?If it existed independently, it raises metaphysical absurdities—how can a partial being precede the whole?Question 5:Did Allah handle or hold the organ?**This question, though uncomfortable, is unavoidable. The narration implies that Allah physically created, held, and possibly placed the genital organ before creating Adam. But Islam teaches that Allah has no body, form, or human likeness. This contradiction violatestanzīh(the doctrine of God’s transcendence).Question 6:Is it theologically permissible to attribute to Allah the act of creating and holding a human sexual organ prior to forming the human being?Such anthropomorphic imagery corrupts the transcendence of deity, reducing divine action to carnal craftsmanship.Question 7:Does this narration inadvertently depict Allah as engaging in a physical act inconsistent with divine purity?If the Creator is without body or form, how could He engage physically with the organ of reproduction before creating its host?Debate III: The Philosophical and Moral DimensionQuestion 8:Why emphasize the genitalia over the mind or heart as the first created organ?This ordering appears to sexualize creation, prioritizing the flesh over the intellect. It diminishes the sacredness of human creation and divine intentionality.Question 9:What does this say about the Islamic understanding of human dignity?If Adam’s identity begins with his genital organ, does this not reduce humanity’s divine image to a biological function rather than a spiritual being?Question 10:Can a narration of this nature be reconciled with the holiness, omniscience, and immateriality of God?If not, does this not call into question the authenticity and divine inspiration of such hadith?Debate IV: The Comparative Biblical PerspectiveThebiblical accountstands in sharp contrast to the Islamic narration. The Book of Genesis portrays God as a transcendent and moral Creator, forming man holistically and spiritually:“So God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.” —Genesis 1:27In Scripture, the order of creation reflects divine intellect, not sensuality. God breathed into man thebreath of life, signifying that spiritual nature precedes physical function. Sexuality is later introduced as a divine gift for procreation within moral boundaries—not as the first act of creation.Debate V: Implications for Islamic TheologyQuestion 11:If the narration is true, what does this reveal about Muhammad’s theological understanding of creation?Would this not imply a lack of divine wisdom and an anthropocentric imagination rather than revelation?Question 12:If false, why does such a narration exist and persist in Islamic texts?This invites scrutiny into the nature of hadith transmission and whether certain narrations reflect cultural taboos rather than divine truth.Question 13:Can Muslims maintain belief in a transcendent Allah while accepting a narration that portrays Him engaging physically with Adam’s sexual organ?The contradiction here is irreconcilable unless the narration is dismissed as apocryphal or heretical.Conclusion: A Call for Rational Theological ReformationThe claim that Adam’s first created organ was his genitalia islogically untenable,theologically contradictory, andmorally questionable. It reduces divine creation to carnal absurdity, conflicts with the principle of divine transcendence, and stands in opposition to the rational, ordered creation revealed in the Bible.This debate invites Muslim scholars to reexamine their textual sources and encourages theologians of all faiths to uphold a conception of God consistent with holiness, rationality, and moral coherence. True creation begins with divine wisdom and ends with divine purpose—not with anthropomorphic invention.BibliographyKitabu cha Mkweli Mwaminifu, Vol. 3–4, 18th Edition (1432 A.H. / 2011).The Holy Bible, Genesis 1:26–27; Genesis 2:7.Abu Bakr al-Jazaeri,Aysar al-Tafasir.Al-Tabari, Muhammad ibn Jarir.Tafsir al-Tabari.Al-Bukhari,Sahih al-Bukhari(Hadith Collection).Shimba, Maxwell.Comparative Theology and Divine Logic.Orlando: Shimba Theological Institute Press, 2024.",

    "full_content": "The First Organ Created in Adam: A Theological ExaminationBy Dr. Max ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis paper critically examines an Islamic narrative claiming that the first organ created in Adam was his male organ (genitalia). The discussion draws upon Islamic textual sources and theological implications surrounding divine creation, anthropomorphism, and the integrity of prophetic traditions. The purpose is to explore the logical, moral, and theological inconsistencies inherent in the claim, especially regarding the divine act of creation as attributed to Allah through Islamic traditions.IntroductionWithin Islamic literature, there exists a peculiar narration suggesting that thefirst body part created in Adam was his male organ (dhakari or penis). This claim appears in certain Islamic commentaries and traditional works, such asKitabu cha Mkweli Mwaminifu(The Book of the Truthful Believer), Volume 3 and 4, 18th Edition, 1432 A.H. (2011). According to this source, Allah is said to have created Adam’s genital organ first, before forming the rest of his body.The narration attributed to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and transmitted by Mujahid states:“The first thing created in the body of Adam (peace be upon him) was his private part. Then it was said to him: ‘O Adam, this is a trust. Do not use it except in the place where you are commanded.’”This account raises significant theological, moral, and philosophical questions about the Islamic understanding of creation and divine purpose.Doctrinal AnalysisAccording to the narration,Allah created Adam’s genital organ prior to his soul or other body parts.Such a concept provokes several theological inquiries:Why would Allah create Adam’s genital organ before creating his soul or consciousness?The order of creation as presented in this narration challenges the rational sequence of divine creation as understood in both biblical and classical theistic traditions. In Judeo-Christian theology, man’s form and soul were created simultaneously as an expression of divine image and purpose (Genesis 1:26–27). The Islamic narration, however, introduces an element of physical prioritization that appears anthropomorphic and lacks divine rationality.Where was Adam’s organ placed after its creation, and for how long did it exist before the rest of his body was formed?The narration does not address the spatial or temporal context of this creation. This silence leads to absurd implications—suggesting that a disembodied organ existed independently of the human being it was meant to belong to.If the organ was created first, does this imply that Allah handled and preserved it physically?Such an implication attributes to Allah physical interaction with a human sexual organ, which contradicts the Islamic claim that Allah is beyond form, body, or human likeness (tanzīh). The theological inconsistency here is profound and undermines the transcendence (tawḥīd) claimed by Islam.Is it theologically acceptable or morally appropriate to ascribe to God the act of creating and holding a human sexual organ prior to the creation of the human being?From both philosophical and ethical standpoints, this narration introduces a disturbing anthropomorphism incompatible with divine holiness and immateriality.Comparative Theological ReflectionFrom aChristian theological perspective, the biblical account of Adam’s creation is profoundly spiritual and purposeful. God formed man in His own image, breathing into him the breath of life (Genesis 2:7). Every part of human anatomy was created in perfect harmony and order, symbolizing divine wisdom rather than carnal emphasis.In contrast, the Islamic narration under discussion diminishes the sanctity of creation by emphasizing a reproductive organ as the primary object of divine craftsmanship. This notion not only contradicts rational order but also conflicts with moral and metaphysical coherence expected in divine creation.ConclusionThe claim that the first organ created in Adam was his male organ presents deeptheological contradictionsandmoral absurdities. It undermines the transcendence of Allah, challenges the logical order of creation, and introduces anthropomorphic notions inconsistent with divine holiness.Therefore, such narrations must be approached critically, and their theological validity questioned within bothIslamic hermeneuticsandphilosophical theology. True divine revelation, as preserved in theHoly Bible, presents creation as an act of divine intelligence, dignity, and purpose—not a carnal or anthropomorphic experiment.BibliographyKitabu cha Mkweli Mwaminifu, Vol. 3–4, 18th Edition (1432 A.H. / 2011).The Holy Bible, Genesis 1:26–27; Genesis 2:7.Al-Jazaeri, Abu Bakr.Aysar al-Tafasir.Al-Bukhari,Sahih al-Bukhari, Hadith Collections.Al-Tabari, Muhammad ibn Jarir.Tafsir al-Tabari.Shimba, Maxwell.Theology and Logic in Comparative Religion.

    "full_content": "Muhammad as a False Prophet in Light of Galatians 1:8By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteInGalatians 1:8, the Apostle Paul delivers one of the strongest warnings in the New Testament:“But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you a gospel contrary to what we have preached to you, he is to be accursed.”(NASB)Paul affirms the finality and sufficiency of the gospel: salvation by grace through faith in Jesus Christ, apart from works of the Law (Galatians 2:16). Any attempt to modify or distort this gospel, even through supposed angelic revelation, falls under divine condemnation. Paul’s immediate concern was with the Judaizers who were undermining the sufficiency of Christ by requiring Gentile converts to adopt Mosaic law. Yet the principle applies universally: no subsequent prophet, teacher, or angelic messenger may introduce a rival gospel.Muhammad and the False GospelWhen considered against Paul’s benchmark, the message of Muhammad fits precisely into the category of “another gospel.” The Qur’an:Denies Jesus as the Son of God (Qur’an 4:171),Rejects His deity (Qur’an 5:72–73),Denies His crucifixion and atonement (Qur’an 4:157).In doing so, Islam dismantles the essence of the Christian gospel: that God, in the person of His Son, reconciled humanity to Himself through the cross and resurrection (2 Corinthians 5:18–21; Romans 10:9). By presenting a Jesus who is merely a prophet and not the incarnate Son of God, Muhammad proclaimed a message fundamentally opposed to apostolic teaching.Moreover, Muhammad claimed angelic mediation through Jibril (Gabriel), precisely the kind of revelation Paul warns against in Galatians 1:8. Hence, by apostolic authority, Muhammad’s message stands condemned as a false gospel.Biblical Parallels: John’s Warning Against AntichristsThe Apostle John further reinforces this point in his letters. In1 John 2:22, he writes:“Who is the liar but the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, the one who denies the Father and the Son.”Similarly, in1 John 4:2–3, John provides a theological test:“Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God; and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God; this is the spirit of the antichrist.”And again in2 John 7, he warns:“Many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist.”Muhammad’s denial of Christ’s Sonship, deity, and incarnation places him squarely within John’s category of antichrist. Thus, not only Paul’s standard in Galatians 1:8 but also John’s test in 1 John identify Muhammad’s gospel as false, deceptive, and antithetical to the truth revealed in Christ.Historical Christian Responses to MuhammadFrom the earliest centuries of Islam, Christian thinkers recognized the incompatibility of Muhammad’s message with the gospel.John of Damascus (c. 675–749), inDe Haeresibus, described Islam as the “heresy of the Ishmaelites” and Muhammad as a false prophet who borrowed from Christianity and Judaism while distorting their truths.^1Peter the Venerable (1092–1156), inSumma totius haeresis Saracenorum, described Islam as a Christian heresy aimed at seducing believers away from Christ.^2Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274), inSumma Contra Gentiles, argued that Muhammad offered no divine confirmation of his message through miracles or prophecy, but rather spread his doctrine by violence, making it a counterfeit revelation.^3Christian Apologists on Muhammad’s MessageModern Christian apologists continue this line of analysis:Norman Geisler and Abdul Saleeb, inAnswering Islam, demonstrate how Islam presents a radically different Jesus—a prophet subordinate to Muhammad rather than the eternal Son of God.^4Josh McDowellemphasizes that Christianity and Islam are mutually exclusive: if Christ is the divine Son who died and rose again, then Islam’s denial of these truths makes it a false gospel.^5William Lane Craighas also noted that Islam’s Christology not only contradicts biblical revelation but logically undermines its own claim to continuity with the biblical prophets.^6ConclusionWhen evaluated in light of Scripture, history, and apologetics, Muhammad fulfills the role of the false prophets predicted by Jesus (Matthew 24:11, 24) and condemned by Paul (Galatians 1:8). His denial of Christ’s Sonship and deity places him under John’s category of “antichrist,” while his claim to angelic revelation brings him under Paul’s anathema.The consistent judgment of the church—from the early fathers to modern apologists—affirms that Muhammad proclaimed “another gospel,” one that leads away from the saving truth of Christ. Therefore, in the words of Paul, Muhammad and the message he proclaimed must be regarded asaccursed.The task of the church remains the same as in Paul’s time: to hold fast to the one true gospel—the good news of Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God, crucified and risen for the redemption of the world.ReferencesJohn of Damascus,De Haeresibus, inThe Fathers of the Church, trans.

    "full_content": "Muhammad as a False Prophet in Light of Galatians 1:8By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteInGalatians 1:8, the Apostle Paul issues a solemn warning to the church:“But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you a gospel contrary to what we have preached to you, he is to be accursed.”(NASB)Paul’s words establish the immutability of the gospel of salvation: justification by grace through faith in Jesus Christ alone (Galatians 2:16). Any alteration—whether presented by a human authority, a supposed prophet, or even an angelic being—is to be rejected as heresy. The Galatians had been troubled by Judaizers, who insisted that Gentile believers must adopt the Mosaic Law, thus undermining the sufficiency of Christ’s atoning sacrifice. Paul therefore denounced such teaching as a corruption of the true gospel.Muhammad and the False GospelMeasured against Paul’s standard, the message of Muhammad represents precisely the “other gospel” that the apostle condemned. The Qur’an denies the divine Sonship of Jesus (Qur’an 4:171), explicitly rejects His deity (Qur’an 5:72–73), and repudiates His crucifixion and atoning work (Qur’an 4:157). In so doing, Islam dismantles the core of Christian soteriology: that God reconciled humanity to Himself through the incarnate Son, crucified and risen for our salvation.Furthermore, Muhammad claimed to have received revelations from the angel Jibril (Gabriel). Yet Paul’s warning in Galatians 1:8 specifically anticipates such a scenario: even if an angel were to preach another gospel, it is to be regarded as accursed. Thus, Muhammad not only fulfills Jesus’ prediction of false prophets (Matthew 24:11, 24) but also stands under the Pauline condemnation for promulgating a counterfeit gospel.Historical Christian Responses to MuhammadEarly Christian encounters with Islam consistently identified Muhammad as a false prophet.John of Damascus (c. 675–749), one of the first Christian theologians to engage Islam systematically, described Muhammad as a “false prophet” who concocted his teachings by borrowing from Judaism and Christianity while distorting their truths. In his workHeresies, John of Damascus classifies Islam as the “heresy of the Ishmaelites,” noting its denial of Christ’s divinity as the hallmark of its error.During the Middle Ages, Christian scholars and apologists such asPeter the Venerable (1092–1156)andThomas Aquinas (1225–1274)also addressed Muhammad’s claims. Peter the Venerable, in hisSumma totius haeresis Saracenorum, characterized Islam as a Christian heresy designed to seduce believers away from the truth of Christ. Aquinas, inSumma Contra Gentiles, argued that Muhammad’s doctrine lacked divine confirmation through miracles and prophecy, but rather spread by violence, thus marking it as human deception rather than divine revelation.Christian Apologists and the False Gospel of IslamModern Christian apologists have likewise situated Muhammad within the framework of Paul’s warning in Galatians.Norman Geisler and Abdul Saleeb, inAnswering Islam, argue that Islam must be rejected because it offers a radically different Christ: not the eternal Son of God, but a created prophet inferior to Muhammad.Josh McDowellhighlights that Christianity and Islam present mutually exclusive truth claims: if Jesus is the divine Son who died and rose again, then Islam’s denial of this makes its message inherently false.Apologists consistently point out that the Qur’an’s appeal to angelic mediation in revelation mirrors precisely the scenario Paul anticipated. By rejecting the crucifixion, resurrection, and deity of Christ, Islam dismantles the only gospel that saves. Therefore, Muhammad’s teachings must be understood not as a continuation of biblical truth, but as a false gospel condemned by apostolic authority.ConclusionFrom a biblical, historical, and apologetic standpoint, Muhammad fulfills the description of a false prophet anticipated by Jesus and condemned by Paul. His message directly opposes the apostolic gospel by denying Christ’s Sonship, deity, and redemptive work. Historical Christian theologians, from John of Damascus to Aquinas, consistently recognized this contradiction and labeled Islam as heretical. Contemporary apologists reaffirm this judgment, emphasizing the incompatibility between the gospel of Christ and the message of Muhammad.In light ofGalatians 1:8, Muhammad must therefore be considered accursed for preaching “another gospel,” one that leads not to salvation but to deception. The church today, as in Paul’s time, must hold fast to the one true gospel: the good news of Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God, crucified and risen for the redemption of the world.",

    "full_content": "The Qur’an or the Bible?A Comparative Apologetic Analysis of Allah, the Qur’an, Islam, and Muhammad vs. Jesus, the Bible, and ChristianityBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThroughout history, the world’s two largest religions—Christianity and Islam—have advanced distinctive and often conflicting portrayals of God, revelation, and salvation. The Qur’an, regarded by Muslims as the final revelation, presents Allah as a deity whose relationship with humanity is contingent upon submission to Islam. The Bible, on the other hand, presents God as love (1 John 4:8), a Father who seeks to reconcile all people to Himself through Jesus Christ. This paper seeks to contrast the theological foundations of Islam and Christianity by comparing the Qur’an’s depiction of Allah with the Bible’s revelation of God, examining the messages of Muhammad and Jesus, and evaluating the implications for human destiny.Allah and God: The Nature of Divine LoveThe Qur’an describes Allah as an adversary to disbelievers:“Whoever is an enemy to Allah and His angels and His messengers and Jibreel and Mikaeel, then indeed Allah is an enemy to the disbelievers.”(Qur’an 2:98)Furthermore, the Qur’an emphasizes that Allah does not love those who reject Islam:“Allah does not love the disbelievers.”(Qur’an 3:32; cf. 22:38, 30:45)In contrast, the Bible reveals God as universal in His love, desiring salvation for all:“For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life.”(John 3:16)“God our Savior desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.”(1 Timothy 2:3–4)Thus, whereas Allah’s love is conditional and selective, the God of the Bible reveals Himself as unconditionally loving, gracious even toward His enemies.Muhammad and Jesus: Teachings on Violence and PeaceMuhammad instructed his followers to engage in aggressive combat against unbelievers:“O you who believe! Fight those of the unbelievers who are near to you, and let them find in you hardness.”(Qur’an 9:123)“Fight them until there is no more persecution and religion is only for Allah.”(Qur’an 8:39)In stark contrast, Jesus Christ proclaimed a radically different ethic:“Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.”(Matthew 5:5)“Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.”(Matthew 5:44)Where Muhammad advocated warfare to expand religious dominance, Jesus exemplified nonviolence and sacrificial love, even unto death on the cross.Islam and Christianity: Theological ImplicationsThe Qur’an’s theology fosters a worldview of hostility toward those outside Islam, legitimizing coercion and militancy. Christianity, however, roots its theology in God’s love revealed in Christ, who came “not to be served, but to serve, and to give His life as a ransom for many”(Mark 10:45).This contrast underscores two fundamentally different visions of God’s kingdom:Islamadvances through submission enforced by power.Christianityadvances through transformation of hearts by divine love.ConclusionThe central apologetic question is not merelyQur’an or Bible?, but ultimatelyWhat vision of God is true?The Qur’an presents Allah as selective in love and hostile to disbelievers, while the Bible presents God as love itself, extending grace to all humanity. Muhammad promoted militant expansion; Jesus Christ offered Himself in meekness, humility, and sacrificial love.Thus, for the Christian apologist, the evidence compels one to affirm the Bible over the Qur’an, Jesus over Muhammad, and Christianity over Islam. For only in Christ do we find a God who is both just and loving, offering redemption not by force, but by grace.",

    "full_content": "The Biblical Command of Love vs. the Quranic Permission of ViolenceBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteOne of the striking differences between the Judeo-Christian Scriptures and the Quran is their treatment of marital ethics and the dignity of women. The Apostle Paul, writing to the church in Ephesus, exhorts husbands:“So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself”(Ephesians 5:28, KJV). The ethic is clear: just as one does not inflict harm on oneself, so a man must never harm his wife. Love, not violence, is the foundation of Christian marriage.In sharp contrast, the Quran in Surah 4:34 provides instruction that has been interpreted by Islamic jurists as legitimizing domestic violence:“… As to those women on whose part you fear disobedience, admonish them, forsake them in beds, and beat them…”(Quran 4:34, Yusuf Ali translation). Unlike the Biblical command to nurture and cherish, this text has historically given religious sanction to wife-beating, creating a normative framework in which physical discipline is embedded in religious practice. Muslim exegetes may attempt to soften the verse linguistically—arguing for symbolic or “light” striking—yet the termidribuhunna(beat them) has consistently been interpreted in Islamic law as a justification for physical chastisement.The implications of these texts are not merely theoretical but manifest in lived realities across Muslim-majority nations. The United Nations and Human Rights Watch report alarming statistics: in Bangladesh, 70% of women experience spousal violence; in Afghanistan, over 85% of women report abuse; in Pakistan, nearly 1,000 women annually fall victim to so-called “honor killings”; in Iran, a woman is murdered by family members on average every two days. These realities reflect a cultural and religious legitimization of violence that traces its roots, in part, to Quranic endorsement.In contrast, Judaism and Christianity have established theological and legal safeguards against domestic abuse. Jewish rabbinical tradition interprets the Torah through the lens of compassion, requiring the husband to honor and provide for his wife (cf. Exodus 21:10; Mishnah Ketubot 5:6). Christian teaching, modeled on Christ’s sacrificial love for the Church, places the husband in the role of servant-leader whose task is to nourish and cherish his wife (Ephesians 5:25–29). In both traditions, spousal abuse is viewed not only as a moral failing but as a violation of divine command and, in modern societies, as a punishable crime under civil law.The absence of any Quranic injunction commanding husbands to “love their wives as themselves” is telling. Instead, polygamy (Quran 4:3), veiling (Quran 33:59), and restrictions on women’s autonomy establish a framework of subjugation rather than partnership. If divine revelation reflects the nature of God, then the Biblical command of love is consistent with the God of grace, whereas the Quranic license to strike one’s wife is consistent with a human, patriarchal imposition.Thus, the theological distinction becomes clear: Christianity and Judaism root marital ethics in love, mutual honor, and the dignity of personhood, while Islam’s textual tradition embeds a sanction for coercion and violence. To conflate the two is to ignore the radical difference between a God who commands sacrificial love and a text that authorizes physical domination.📖ReferencesThe Holy Bible, King James Version.The Holy Quran, Surah 4:34 (Yusuf Ali Translation).Mishnah Ketubot 5:6.United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) Reports on Violence Against Women.Human Rights Watch,World Report on Women’s Rights.",

    "full_content": "Isaiah 9:6–7 and the Question of Corruption:A Scholarly Response to Islamic PolemicsBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteAbstractMuslim apologists frequently charge that Christian translators have “corrupted” Isaiah 9:6–7 by interpolating exalted titles such as“Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.”They contrast this with the Septuagint (LXX), which reads“Messenger of Great Counsel.”This paper demonstrates that the alleged corruption is a misunderstanding oftextual criticism, translation history, and theology.By examining the Hebrew Masoretic Text (MT), the Septuagint (LXX), and the Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS), this study affirms the integrity of Isaiah’s prophecy and its fulfillment in Jesus Christ.1. IntroductionAmong the most profound messianic prophecies in the Hebrew Bible, Isaiah 9:6–7 stands as a cornerstone for Jewish and Christian theology. The child promised here is described as a Davidic ruler whose reign will never end. Christians have traditionally understood this prophecy as fulfilled in Jesus Christ.Islamic critics, however, often argue that the Christian rendering of the text is the result ofinterpolation. They suggest that translators, particularly of the Hebrew Masoretic tradition, added divine titles to support Christological doctrines. Instead, they claim, the Septuagint’s reading (“Messenger of Great Counsel”) represents the authentic text.This paper will demonstrate that such claims are historically, textually, and theologically flawed.2. Textual Foundations of Isaiah 9:6–72.1 The Masoretic Text (MT)The MT, preserved by Jewish scribes, clearly reads:“Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace”(Isaiah 9:6, MT).The Hebrew terms—peleʾ yōʿēṣ, ʾēl gibbōr, ʾaḇî-ʿaḏ, śar šālôm—unambiguously confer divine attributes on the promised child. This reading has been preserved consistently across Jewish tradition, predating Christianity by centuries.2.2 The Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS)The DSS (150 B.C.–70 A.D.) provide critical pre-Christian evidence. TheGreat Isaiah Scroll (1QIsaᵃ)contains Isaiah 9:6 with the readingEl Gibbor(“Mighty God”).1This demonstrates that the exalted titles existedbefore Christianityand thus cannot be later Christian interpolations.2.3 The Septuagint (LXX)The LXX, translated into Greek ca. 250–150 B.C., renders Isaiah 9:6 more interpretively:“His name is called Messenger of Great Counsel, for I will bring peace upon the rulers, peace and health to him.”This translation does not negate the MT’s reading but reflects afunctional renderingof the child’s role as the bearer of God’s salvific plan.3. Textual Variants and the Question of CorruptionMuslim polemicists equate textual diversity with corruption. However,textual criticismshows otherwise:Variants reflecttranslation philosophy(literal vs. interpretive), not falsification.The MT and DSS attest the divine titles long before the rise of Christianity or Islam.The LXX often paraphrases to make Hebrew idioms accessible to Greek audiences.2To claim “corruption” is to impose an anachronistic Islamic lens on Jewish and Christian textual history.4. Theological Implications of the Text4.1 The Masoretic WitnessThe MT emphasizes thedivine identityof the child: He isMighty God(El Gibbor) andPrince of Peace(Śar Šālôm). These titles exceed what would be expected of any mere Davidic king.4.2 The Septuagint WitnessThe LXX’s“Messenger of Great Counsel”is equally messianic. In biblical theology, God’s “counsel” refers to His eternal redemptive plan (cf. Isaiah 46:10; Ephesians 1:11). To be the “Messenger of Great Counsel” is to be the agent of God’s salvific will, fulfilled supremely in Christ as theLogos(John 1:1, 14).4.3 Fulfillment in ChristThe New Testament directly applies Isaiah’s prophecy to Jesus:“He will be great and will be called Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David, and He will reign… forever.”(Luke 1:32–33)“For unto you is born this day… a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.”(Luke 2:11)Both textual traditions—MT and LXX—find their climax in Christ, the divine King whose rule brings peace without end.5. Critique of the Islamic NarrativeThe Islamic charge of corruption fails on multiple grounds:Historical– The MT and DSS predate both Christianity and Islam; divine titles existed in the Jewish text long before Jesus.Textual– Variants in LXX and MT reflect translation strategy, not manipulation.Theological– Both traditions affirm a messianic figure whose reign is eternal, incompatible with Islamic denials of Jesus’ divine kingship.Comparative– Unlike the Bible, the Quran lacks early manuscript diversity, making Islam’s textual history more fragile by comparison.36. ConclusionIsaiah 9:6–7 provides one of the clearest testimonies to the Messiah’s divine nature and eternal rule. Far from proving corruption, the MT, DSS, and LXX together illustrate therich textual witnessof the Hebrew Bible and its messianic fulfillment in Jesus Christ.The Muslim charge of interpolation collapses when examined against the weight ofhistorical manuscripts and textual evidence. Isaiah foresaw the coming of the divine Son who would bring peace, justice, and eternal rule—a prophecy realized in the birth and reign of Jesus Christ, centuries before Muhammad appeared.ReferencesDr. Shimba, would you like me to alsoadd a comparative sectionwhere I contrast Isaiah 9:6–7 with the Quran’s failure to provide similar messianic prophecy (showing Islam’s lack of predictive prophecy), so that this article also directly dismantles the Islamic polemic on theological grounds?FootnotesEugene Ulrich,The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Origins of the Bible(Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1999), 97–99.↩Emanuel Tov,Textual Criticism of the Hebrew Bible, 3rd ed.

The specific accusation is that titles such as“Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace”were “interpolated” by Christian translators to elevate the prophecy to a Christological level. Instead, the LXX renders the passage as:“His name is called the Messenger of Great Counsel: for I will bring peace upon the princes, and health to him.”This objection, however, collapses under carefulhistorical, textual, and theological analysis.1. Textual Variants Are Not “Corruption”The Septuagint (3rd–2nd century B.C.) is aGreek translationof the Hebrew Bible, not the original Hebrew text itself. Variations between the LXX and the MT do not automatically indicate “corruption,” but ratherdifferent manuscript traditions. Even Jewish scholars recognize that the LXX sometimes paraphrased, simplified, or interpreted Hebrew idioms for a Greek-speaking audience.For example, the Hebrew phrasepeleʾ yōʿēṣ, ʾēl gibbōr, ʾaḇî-ʿaḏ, śar šālôm(“Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace”) may have been rendered more fluidly in the LXX to highlight thefunctionof the child as God’s divinely appointed ruler and bringer of peace, rather than emphasizing his divine titles. This isinterpretation, not corruption.2. The Hebrew Masoretic Text is Clearer and EarlierTheHebrew Masoretic Text, preserved by Jewish scribes, clearly contains the exalted titles of Isaiah 9:6. It predates Islam by over a millennium and has been found in fragments at Qumran (Dead Sea Scrolls, ca. 150 B.C.–70 A.D.), which confirms the integrity of these divine titles long before Christianity or Islam. The Qumran Isaiah scroll (1QIsaᵃ) confirms the reading ofMighty God(El Gibbor) in Isaiah 9:6.Thus, the divine titles are not “Christian inventions,” butrooted in the Jewish textual tradition itself.3. The Septuagint Still Affirms Messianic SignificanceEven the Septuagint, despite its paraphrastic rendering, calls the child“Messenger of Great Counsel”. This expression points to one who delivers thedivine plan of salvation—a role perfectly fulfilled by Jesus Christ, whom the New Testament calls theLogos(John 1:1, 14) and the one who reveals the Father (John 14:9).The promise that God will bring “peace upon the princes” aligns with Christ’s role as the one who reconciles humanity to God (Ephesians 2:14–18). Therefore, the LXX and the MTdo not contradict, but rather complement one another in their messianic anticipation.4. No Basis for the Islamic “Corruption” ChargeMuslim polemicists assume that any textual difference must mean deliberate Christian corruption. Yet this ignores the historical fact that:Both Jews and Christianstransmitted these texts before Islam existed.Jewish rabbis—who rejected Christ—preserved the same Hebrew text (with the divine titles). Surely Jews had no reason to “Christianize” their Scriptures.The early Church used both the LXX and the Hebrew traditions, finding Christ foreshadowed in both.Therefore, the Islamic accusation is historically unsustainable. The biblical witness predates Muhammad by centuries, and the textual integrity of Isaiah isbetter attested than the Quran, which lacks such manuscript diversity and early witnesses.5. The Christological FulfillmentWhether one reads the MT (“Mighty God, Prince of Peace”) or the LXX (“Messenger of Great Counsel”), the prophecy points toward a divine ruler who will establish an everlasting kingdom on David’s throne. The New Testament applies this directly to Jesus Christ (Luke 1:32–33).Thus, Isaiah 9:6–7 is not diminished butmagnifiedin its witness: the promised Son is both divine in nature and messianic in mission. The Jewish Scriptures testify to His deity, and the Greek LXX affirms His role as God’s messenger of salvation.ConclusionIsaiah 9:6–7 stands as one of the clearest Old Testament prophecies of the Messiah’s divine identity and eternal reign. The alleged “corruption” is a misunderstanding of how textual traditions and translations work. Far from being an interpolation, the divine titles in the Hebrew text are authentic and ancient.Muslim critics must explain whypre-Christian Jewish manuscriptsalready contained these titles if they were supposedly later Christian additions. The reality is that the prophecy of Isaiah points unambiguously toJesus Christ as the divine King of peace, centuries before Muhammad was born.",

    "full_content": "Prophetic Guidance on Marital Boundaries: A Critical ExaminationBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThe interactions between the Prophet Muhammad and the spouses of his companions present complex questions regarding marital ethics, religious authority, and personal conduct. One Hadith narrates a situation where a companion expressed concern over the Prophet’s behavior toward his wife, raising theological and ethical inquiries about the Prophet’s guidance on marriage, divorce, and personal boundaries. This article critically examines the narration, its context, and its implications for understanding prophetic conduct in Islam.IntroductionIslamic tradition provides numerous narrations of the Prophet Muhammad’s interactions with his companions and their families. Among these narrations, certain Hadiths describe incidents that may appear perplexing to contemporary readers, particularly regarding marital relationships and personal boundaries. One such Hadith recounts a companion expressing concern that the Prophet had touched his wife, to which the Prophet advised initially divorce, and subsequently to retain the marriage due to love for the spouse.This account raises several questions:Why would the Prophet recommend divorce and later advise maintaining the marriage?How do scholars interpret the apparent tension between ethical norms and prophetic guidance?What are the broader theological implications for marital ethics in Islamic tradition?Examination of the HadithThe Hadith under consideration is narrated as follows:A companion approached the Prophet, expressing concern that the Prophet had touched his wife. He said, “O Prophet, O Allah, you touched my wife, and I do not like that.” The Prophet initially replied, “Divorce that woman.” The companion expressed love for his wife, and the Prophet subsequently said, “Hold on to your woman” (Hadith reference needed).At first glance, the account appears contradictory. The Prophet’s initial recommendation to divorce seems severe, whereas the subsequent counsel to maintain the marriage emphasizes love and familial unity.Contextual ConsiderationsScholars emphasize the importance of understanding Hadiths within their historical, social, and linguistic contexts. Several factors may clarify this narration:Expression of Marital Concern: The companion’s worry could have reflected broader social norms concerning honor, personal boundaries, and family reputation.Prophetic Guidance Balancing Justice and Compassion: The Prophet’s response demonstrates a nuanced approach to marital disputes, weighing both legal permissibility and emotional attachment. Islamic jurisprudence often emphasizes reconciliation and retention of marriage where possible (Ibn Hajar, 2001).Cultural Norms of Interaction: Physical gestures in early Islamic society could carry different social meanings than they do today. A nuanced understanding of these norms is critical before making ethical judgments.Critical AnalysisModern readers may question the ethical propriety of the Prophet’s physical interactions with companions’ wives. Critics argue that such behavior could constitute a violation of marital boundaries. However, classical Islamic scholarship interprets these narrations through several lenses:Metaphorical or Educational Function: Certain Hadiths convey moral lessons rather than literal prescriptions.Verification and Authentication: The reliability of Hadith depends on chains of narration (Isnad) and the credibility of transmitters. Many controversial narrations are subject to scrutiny and may be weak (Da’if) or contextually misunderstood.Prophetic Example (Sunnah): The Prophet’s actions are always considered within the framework of divine guidance. Even when behavior appears contradictory, scholars emphasize that ethical guidance is often situational and context-driven (Suyuti, 1989).Implications for Marital EthicsThis Hadith underscores several principles relevant to Islamic marital ethics:Emphasis on Love and Emotional Bonds: The Prophet’s ultimate instruction to “hold on to your woman” reflects the high value Islam places on affection and loyalty in marriage (Quran 30:21).Flexibility in Legal Rulings: Islamic jurisprudence often allows for discretion, reflecting the principle that moral guidance must consider context and individual circumstances.Reconciliation Over Separation: Divorce is permitted but not encouraged; preservation of the marital bond is preferred whenever possible (Al-Bukhari, Sahih al-Bukhari).ConclusionWhile at first glance, this Hadith may seem to reflect contradictory advice, a careful scholarly analysis shows that the Prophet’s guidance balances legal permissibility, compassion, and social context. Rather than being an endorsement of inappropriate behavior, the narration highlights the Prophet’s nuanced approach to marital ethics and the centrality of love, patience, and reconciliation in marital relationships.ReferencesAl-Bukhari, Muhammad ibn Ismail.Sahih al-Bukhari.

    "full_content": "Prophetic Guidance on Marital Boundaries: A Critical ExaminationBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThe interactions between the Prophet Muhammad and the spouses of his companions present complex questions regarding marital ethics, religious authority, and personal conduct. One Hadith narrates a situation where a companion expressed concern over the Prophet’s behavior toward his wife, raising theological and ethical inquiries about the Prophet’s guidance on marriage, divorce, and personal boundaries. This article critically examines the narration, its context, and its implications for understanding prophetic conduct in Islam, drawing from Hadith verification, historical-cultural norms, and Islamic jurisprudence.IntroductionIslamic tradition contains numerous narrations of the Prophet Muhammad’s interactions with his companions and their families. Among these, certain Hadiths describe incidents that may appear perplexing or even ethically problematic to contemporary readers. One such narration recounts a companion expressing concern that the Prophet had touched his wife. The companion reportedly said:“O Prophet, O Allah, you touched my wife, and I do not like that.”The Prophet’s initial response was:“Divorce that woman.”Upon hearing the companion’s affirmation of love for his wife, the Prophet advised:“Hold on to your woman.”(Hadith reference: [citation needed])At first glance, the Hadith may appear contradictory. The Prophet’s initial advice seems harsh, yet his subsequent counsel emphasizes compassion and relational preservation. This article explores this narration critically, situating it in historical, cultural, and theological contexts, and examines its implications for Islamic marital ethics.Historical and Cultural Context1. Marital Norms in 7th-Century ArabiaIn pre-Islamic and early Islamic Arabia, marital relations were governed not only by personal preference but also by social customs, family honor, and community expectations. Physical interactions carried symbolic meanings; a touch could signal authority, blessing, or social negotiation rather than sexual intent. Understanding the Prophet’s actions requires awareness of these social norms.2. Prophetic Authority and Ethical GuidanceThe Prophet Muhammad’s role extended beyond spiritual leadership; he functioned as a legal, social, and moral guide. His interactions were often situational, addressing specific relational or societal issues. Scholars argue that some Hadiths reflectcontextual guidancerather than universal prescriptions (Ibn Hajar, 2001; Suyuti, 1989).Examination of the Hadith1. The Companion’s ConcernThe companion’s worry—“you touched my wife, and I do not like that”—reflects a sensitivity to personal and familial honor, a central value in early Arab culture. It also highlights the companion’s trust in the Prophet’s judgment, seeking divine-guided counsel for an emotionally complex situation.2. The Prophet’s Dual GuidanceThe Prophet’s initial recommendation of divorce can be interpreted as alegal option, signaling that separation is permissible if personal boundaries are violated. The subsequent advice to “hold on to your woman” emphasizesemotional bonds, reconciliation, and the preservation of family unity. This reflects a balanced approach: respecting legal rights while prioritizing relational harmony (Quran 30:21; Al-Bukhari).3. Contextual InterpretationClassical scholars suggest that certain Hadiths must be interpreted in light of:TheIsnad(chain of narration) to assess reliability. Weak or isolated reports may be misunderstood if taken literally.Thepurpose (Maqasid al-Shariah)of Islamic law, which prioritizes justice, compassion, and social stability.Metaphorical or didactic functions, where the narration serves as moral instruction rather than a literal historical account.Theological and Ethical Analysis1. Boundaries and Prophetic ConductCritics question the ethical propriety of the Prophet’s alleged physical interactions with companions’ wives. Classical scholarship maintains thatthe Prophet’s actions were guided by divine instruction, and any behavior must be contextualized within social norms and spiritual objectives (Suyuti, 1989).2. Divorce Versus ReconciliationIslamic jurisprudence emphasizes reconciliation over divorce. Divorce is permissible but discouraged unless irreconcilable conflict arises. The Prophet’s counsel to retain the marriage aligns with Quranic principles emphasizing love, mercy, and mutual respect in marriage (Quran 30:21; 2:231).3. Emotional Attachment and Moral ResponsibilityThe Hadith underscores the importance of love and emotional connection in marital ethics. Even when legal separation is an option, Islam prioritizes reconciliation, highlighting the moral responsibility to preserve familial bonds whenever possible.Comparative Analysis1. Quranic PerspectiveThe Quran consistently emphasizes marriage as adivinely ordained covenant:“And among His signs is that He created for you from yourselves mates that you may find tranquility in them; and He placed between you affection and mercy.” (Quran 30:21)The Prophet’s advice to retain the marriage reflects alignment with this Quranic principle.2. Cross-Religious ConsiderationsFrom a broader theological perspective, Islamic marital ethics share similarities with other Abrahamic traditions, where reconciliation, love, and moral responsibility are prioritized over unilateral separation, demonstrating a consistent divine concern for relational harmony.Hadith Verification and Scholarly Debate1. Authenticity (Sahih, Hasan, Da’if)Hadith scholars classify narrations based on the reliability of transmitters. Reports that appear ethically or socially controversial often undergo rigorous scrutiny, and some may be consideredweak (Da’if)or contextually misunderstood.2. Interpretive PrinciplesKey principles for interpreting Hadiths include:Contextualization: Understanding the social, linguistic, and historical setting.Legal and Ethical Alignment: Ensuring interpretation aligns with Quranic principles.Comparative Cross-Reference: Consulting multiple Hadith collections to avoid isolated misinterpretation (Al-Bukhari; Muslim; Abu Dawud).Implications for Contemporary UnderstandingMarital Counseling and Ethical Guidance: The Hadith highlights the Prophet’s practical guidance in resolving marital disputes, balancing legal permissibility with emotional attachment.Preservation of Family Unity: Emphasis on reconciliation and retention of the marriage demonstrates Islam’s prioritization of social stability and familial harmony.Critical Engagement with Texts: Contemporary readers must approach historical narrations with critical scholarship, considering authenticity, context, and theological alignment.ConclusionThe Hadith concerning the Prophet Muhammad, a companion, and his wife illustrates a nuanced approach to marital ethics. While initial counsel suggested divorce as a legal option, the ultimate instruction emphasized love, emotional attachment, and reconciliation. Far from endorsing improper behavior, the narration reflects the Prophet’s balanced guidance, aligning with Quranic principles and Islamic jurisprudence.Through careful contextual and scholarly analysis, this Hadith reinforces the centrality of compassion, responsibility, and moral discernment in marital relationships.ReferencesAl-Bukhari, Muhammad ibn Ismail.Sahih al-Bukhari.

This article examines that empirical fact, surveys Islamic and Christian/Jewish source material, considers historical and literary explanations, and raises critical questions directed to Muslim theological and historical accounts. The paper concludes by suggesting avenues for further research and offers footnote-style references and a journal-style bibliography.1. Introduction — statement of the problemReaders of the Qurʾān will note that most of the prophets named in its text are the same persons who appear in the Hebrew Bible. If one compiles the names that appear by explicit mention, a canonical count frequently cited in Islamic literature is 25 named prophets (though Islamic tradition also speaks of many thousands of prophets sent to humankind). The striking overlap between Qurʾānic prophet-names and the Hebrew Bible raises academic questions about source-relations, reception, and the Qurʾān’s self-presentation as a continuation or correction of earlier revelation. This paper sets out those facts, outlines possible explanatory frameworks, and formulates pointed, scholarly questions for Muslim interpreters. (Riwaya)2. Empirical overview: who the Qurʾān names (selective list)The Qurʾān explicitly names (in its Arabic forms) many figures who are also prominent in Jewish and Christian scriptures: Adam, Noah (Nūḥ), Abraham (Ibrāhīm), Ishmael (Ismāʿīl), Isaac (Isḥāq), Jacob (Yaʿqūb), Joseph (Yūsuf), Moses (Mūsā), Aaron (Hārūn), David (Dāwūd), Solomon (Sulaimān), Job (Ayyūb), Jonah (Yūnus), Elijah (Ilyās), Elisha (Al-Yasaʿ), and Jesus (ʿĪsā), among others. Many Surahs explicitly list groups of prophets together (for example, Qurʾān 4:163 and 6:84 mention Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob and many of their descendants). The count “25 named prophets” is widely repeated in both Muslim devotional literature and academic summaries. (Quran.com)Load-bearing facts (examples):The Qurʾān names a set of prophets that largely overlaps the Hebrew Bible’s principal figures (e.g., Moses, Abraham, David). (Quran.com)Islamic tradition (exegesis and hadith) also treats the “people of Israel” and their succession of prophets as a primary ancient prophetic locus. (Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research)3. Historical and literary context (brief survey)Scholars of early Islam note several relevant points: the Qurʾān addresses communities in late antique Arabia who were already familiar with Jewish and Christian narratives; the Qurʾān self-presents as correcting or restoring what it calls distorted earlier scriptures; and the use of familiar biblical names and episodes functions rhetorically to situate Islam within an Abrahamic line and to make moral/theological points using well-known exemplars. Some recent academic discussions investigate how the Qurʾān engages Jewish and Christian textual materials and oral traditions in late antiquity. (Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research)4. Onomastics (names and forms) — Arabic translations of older namesA straightforward observation is that the Qurʾān uses Arabicized forms of Semitic names (e.g., Ibrāhīm ← *Avraham/Abraham; Mūsā ←Moses; Isḥāq ←Isaac). Linguistically and historically this is unsurprising: Arabic and Hebrew/Aramaic are Semitic languages that share many roots and name forms; when a text moves between Semitic languages names are typically adapted phonologically. But the deeper question is not phonology alone — it is why the Qurʾān’s corpus uses a particular roster of named figures rather than naming more local Arabian, African, or Mesopotamian prophetic figures. This demands a historical explanation (see §5). (Wikipedia)5. Explanatory frameworks (competing hypotheses)Below are plausible scholarly frameworks that can help explain the predominance of Israelite/Jewish-named prophets in the Qurʾān. Each has different theological and historical consequences.A. Continuity hypothesis (Islamic theological claim).Islamic doctrine often asserts prophetic continuity: God sent prophets to every people (Qurʾān 35:24; 16:36) and the Qurʾān presumes many unnamed prophets, but it names those who are paradigmatic for its message. Thus, from an Islamic theological vantage, the Qurʾān’s list emphasizes the Abrahamic line because that lineage is central to the Qurʾān’s teaching. (Qurʾān 21:25; 33:40 discusses Muhammad as the seal of the prophets.) (Quran.com)B. Reception/availability hypothesis.Late antique Arabian audiences were exposed to Jewish and Christian narratives circulating in oral and written form. The Qurʾān selects names and episodes that would have immediate recognition and rhetorical force with such audiences; hence the high overlap. This is a literary-historical account that treats the Qurʾān as reworking existing narrative material. (The Bart Ehrman Blog)C. Canon-formation and selection bias.The Qurʾān is not an encyclopedic list of every prophet in world history; rather, it quotes and names a selection of exemplars suitable to its theological aims (e.g., monotheism, covenant, patience under persecution). Those exemplars happen to be the most prominent figures in the Judeo-Christian scriptural tradition. This is a functional explanation rather than a claim about origins. (Quran.com)D. Polemical/communicative hypothesis.Some scholars argue the Qurʾān intentionally engages Jewish and Christian scriptures polemically — to assert superiority/correction of what it calls corruptions — and therefore foregrounds the Israelite prophets as subjects of correction, exhortation, or confirmation. (Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research)Each framework yields different critical questions for Muslim theologians and historians. The next section lists such questions.6. Scholarly questions directed to Muslim interpreters (critical, respectful, and evidence-oriented)Selection logic:What theological or historical criteria determined which prophets would be named in the Qurʾān and which would remain unnamed? If prophecy was universal, why are predominantly Israelite figures the Qurʾān’s exemplars? (See Qurʾān 4:163; 6:84.) (Quran.com)Source relationships:To what extent does the Qurʾān depend on, adapt, or correct Jewish and Christian textual or oral traditions available in Arabia? Can Muslim scholarship map specific episodes to identifiable Jewish/Christian sources or oral cycles? (The Bart Ehrman Blog)Onomastic origins:Given that the Hebrew Bible predates the Qurʾān by many centuries, how should Muslim scholars explain the strictly Hebrew / Israelite provenance of so many prophet-names (beyond the shared Semitic linguistic milieu)? Is the Qurʾān presenting these figures as genuinely the same historical persons, or as analogues? (Wikipedia)Geographical focus:Why does the Qurʾān’s named prophetic roster appear geographically concentrated in the Levant and Mesopotamia rather than, for example, in South Arabia, North Africa, or Persia — regions with their own religious histories? Are there Qurʾānic or hadithic sources that justify this geographical emphasis? (Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research)Tradition-critique:Some Hadith and exegetical traditions speak of many more prophets (e.g., 124,000). How do exegetes reconcile the wide number of prophets with the small set of named figures in the Qurʾān? What are the criteria used in early tafsīr for associating named Qurʾānic figures with biblical characters? (Facebook)Intertextual differences:Where the Qurʾān retells episodes known from the Hebrew Bible, how do the Qurʾānic versions differ in doctrinally significant ways (e.g., Christology, covenantal claims, eschatology)? Can those differences be shown to be innovations, corrections, or independent traditions? (The Bart Ehrman Blog)These questions invite substantive replies from Muslim exegetes and historians and can be the basis of constructive academic exchange.7. Methodology — how this inquiry was assembledThis paper compiled Qurʾānic references (selected verses that group or name prophets), primary hadith references about prophets (representative Sahih collections), comparative biblical citations (selected Genesis/Exodus passages for Abraham and Moses), and modern scholarship about Qurʾān–Biblical intertextuality. The purpose here is not to adjudicate ultimate theological truth claims but to map observable patterns and pose academically defensible questions. (Quran.com)8. Discussion — implications and a modest conclusionThat most named prophets in the Qurʾān are figures known from Jewish (and Christian) scriptures is an empirically verifiable fact. Explanations range from theological claims of prophetic continuity to historical explanations about the textual environment of late antique Arabia. For critics, this overlap raises questions about source dependence, authorship, and the Qurʾān’s self-presentation as either a restoration of older revelation or as a text that draws upon familiar religious biographies to make new claims. For Muslim apologists, the overlap is typically explained by continuity (the same God sending the same core revelation to Abrahamic figures) and by functional selection (the Qurʾān names those exemplars most relevant to its message). Both sides should engage the historical and philological evidence carefully and respectfully. (Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research)9. Suggested further research agendaA philological study comparing the Qurʾānic Arabic forms with Hebrew/Aramaic name variants, exploring transmission paths.A systematic mapping of Qurʾānic episodes to earliest extant Jewish and Christian texts and to known oral traditions.An examination of pre-Islamic Arabian inscriptions and narratives for non-Israelite prophetic traditions to test the geographical-selection hypothesis.A comprehensive review of tafsīr literature to catalogue exegetical rationales for the Qurʾān’s prophet selections.10.

This claim is grounded in the Qur’anic doctrine offitrah(innate disposition), a belief that every child is born with an instinctive orientation toward monotheism. Yet this doctrine introduces serious theological and logical difficulties. If all humanity—including Adam—was already born in submission, what then is the need for religion, prophets, and revelation? The following study critically examines the coherence of Islam’sfitrahdoctrine and contrasts it with the biblical doctrine of creation, fall, and redemption.The Fitrah in the Qur’anThe Qur’an teaches that mankind is created in a state of natural submission:“So set your face toward the religion, inclining to truth. [Adhere to] the fitrah of Allah upon which He has created [all] people. No change should there be in the creation of Allah. That is the correct religion, but most of the people do not know”(Qur’an 30:30).¹Here, Islam asserts that submission to Allah is woven into human nature itself. Consequently, Adam is presumed to have been “born Muslim,” not by choice or revelation, but by creation. This implies that divine guidance is already embedded within man’s nature from birth.The Redundancy of Prophets in IslamIf mankind is already born in a state of submission, the question arises: why the need for prophets and scriptures at all? Prophets are traditionally viewed as guides who recall mankind to truth. But if thefitrahis uncorrupted and sufficient, such guidance becomes redundant. On the other hand, if guidance is still required, this implies that thefitrahis inadequate to preserve submission.This paradox undermines Islamic theology:If thefitrahis sufficient, then the Qur’an, prophets, and Muhammad are unnecessary.If thefitrahis insufficient, then the Qur’an contradicts itself by claiming all people are already born in submission.Infants, Judgment, and the Problem of SalvationThe Islamic position leads to further inconsistency. If all infants are born Muslim by default, then they already fulfill the divine requirement without knowledge of Muhammad or the Qur’an. Islamic tradition often holds that children who die before maturity enter Paradise based on theirfitrah.² But this undermines the necessity of Islam’s religious system, since revelation is not required for their salvation.If salvation is attainable without prophetic revelation for infants, why not for all humanity? This exposes a deep theological dilemma: either revelation is essential for salvation, in which case thefitrahdoctrine collapses, or revelation is non-essential, rendering Muhammad and the Qur’an unnecessary.The Biblical View: Creation, Fall, and RedemptionChristianity presents a more coherent account of humanity’s condition. The Bible teaches that Adam was indeed created in fellowship with God but fell into sin through disobedience (Genesis 3). This fall disrupted man’s natural communion with God, introducing death and alienation. Unlike the Islamic doctrine offitrah, the Bible affirms that mankind is not born in unbroken submission but in a fallen state:“Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me”(Psalm 51:5).³ The Apostle Paul echoes this:“Sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all people, because all sinned”(Romans 5:12).⁴Therefore, prophets in Scripture do not merely remind humanity of an innate submission but reveal God’s redemptive plan. This plan culminates in Jesus Christ, who restores mankind to fellowship with God through His death and resurrection (Romans 5:18–19; 1 Corinthians 15:22). Christianity thus explains both the need for revelation and the necessity of salvation in a way that is logically consistent and theologically complete.The Necessity of ChristWhere Islam struggles with the redundancy of prophets under thefitrahdoctrine, Christianity maintains coherence in affirming the necessity of Christ. Humanity is not simply misled but fallen. Thus, a mere reminder is insufficient; restoration requires atonement. Jesus fulfills this role uniquely—performing miracles (John 11:43–44), revealing God perfectly (John 14:9), dying for sin (Hebrews 9:26–28), and rising again (John 11:25). Unlike Muhammad, whose role is limited to instruction, Jesus provides actual redemption.Scholarly ImplicationsThe doctrine offitrahreveals a structural weakness in Islamic apologetics. By claiming that all people are born Muslim, Islam undercuts its own need for prophets and scripture. The Qur’an and Muhammad’s mission become either redundant or contradictory. Christianity, however, avoids this problem by offering a coherent anthropology: man was created good, fell into sin, and requires redemption through Christ. This framework accounts for both the necessity of revelation and the uniqueness of salvation history.From an academic standpoint, this paradox within Islam underscores the superiority of the biblical worldview. Islam attempts to explain the human condition through innate submission, but the reality of sin, moral corruption, and the universal need for redemption point toward the Christian gospel as the only consistent answer. Thus, while Islam’s doctrine offitrahfalters under scrutiny, the Christian narrative demonstrates theological integrity, historical grounding, and salvific necessity.ReferencesQur’an 30:30 (Sahih International translation).Sahih al-Bukhari 1385; Sahih Muslim 2658 — traditions affirming that children of Muslims (and, in some narrations, all children) are admitted into Paradise.Psalm 51:5 (NIV).Romans 5:12 (NIV).

But this undermines the necessity of Islam’s religious system, since revelation is not required for their salvation. If salvation is attainable without prophetic revelation for infants, why not for all humanity?This exposes a deep theological dilemma: either revelation is essential for salvation, in which case thefitrahdoctrine collapses, or revelation is non-essential, rendering Muhammad and the Qur’an unnecessary.The Biblical View: Creation, Fall, and RedemptionChristianity presents a more coherent account of humanity’s condition. The Bible teaches that Adam was indeed created in fellowship with God but fell into sin through disobedience (Genesis 3). This fall disrupted man’s natural communion with God, introducing death and alienation. Unlike the Islamic doctrine offitrah, the Bible affirms that mankind is not born in unbroken submission but in a fallen state (Romans 5:12; Psalm 51:5).Therefore, prophets in Scripture do not merely remind humanity of an innate submission but reveal God’s redemptive plan. This plan culminates in Jesus Christ, who restores mankind to fellowship with God through His death and resurrection (Romans 5:18–19; 1 Corinthians 15:22). Christianity thus explains both the need for revelation and the necessity of salvation in a way that is logically consistent and theologically complete.The Necessity of ChristWhere Islam struggles with the redundancy of prophets under thefitrahdoctrine, Christianity maintains coherence in affirming the necessity of Christ. Humanity is not simply misled but fallen. Thus, a mere reminder is insufficient; restoration requires atonement. Jesus fulfills this role uniquely—performing miracles, revealing God perfectly, dying for sin, and rising again (John 11:25; Hebrews 9:26–28). Unlike Muhammad, whose role is limited to instruction, Jesus provides actual redemption.Scholarly ImplicationsThe doctrine offitrahreveals a structural weakness in Islamic apologetics. By claiming that all people are born Muslim, Islam undercuts its own need for prophets and scripture. The Qur’an and Muhammad’s mission become either redundant or contradictory. Christianity, however, avoids this problem by offering a coherent anthropology: man was created good, fell into sin, and requires redemption through Christ. This framework accounts for both the necessity of revelation and the uniqueness of salvation history.From an academic standpoint, this paradox within Islam underscores the superiority of the biblical worldview. Islam attempts to explain the human condition through innate submission, but the reality of sin, moral corruption, and the universal need for redemption point toward the Christian gospel as the only consistent answer. Thus, while Islam’s doctrine offitrahfalters under scrutiny, the Christian narrative demonstrates theological integrity, historical grounding, and salvific necessity.",

    "full_content": "The Question of Salvation in Islam and ChristianityBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteOne of the most pressing theological issues between Islam and Christianity is the question of salvation and assurance of eternal life. The Qur’an itself acknowledges uncertainty in this matter, even concerning the Prophet Muhammad. InSurah al-Ahqaf(46:9), Muhammad declares:“I am not something original among the messengers, nor do I know what will be done with me or with you. I only follow that which is revealed to me, and I am only a clear warner.”This verse raises a critical point: Muhammad himself confessed ignorance of his ultimate destiny and that of his followers. From a doctrinal standpoint, this suggests that Islam does not guarantee salvation even to its founder, let alone to his adherents.Further, the Qur’an explicitly states inSurah Maryam(19:71):“There is none of you but will come to it [Hell]; this is upon your Lord an inevitability decreed.”Islamic commentators have long debated whether this means that all Muslims will inevitably enter Hell, if only temporarily, before possibly being delivered. Yet the plain text offers no assurance of escape, highlighting a stark contrast with the Christian promise of eternal life.In the New Testament, Jesus Christ declares with absolute authority:“I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me”(John 14:6).Unlike Muhammad’s uncertainty, Christ provides an unambiguous assurance of salvation through His sacrificial death and resurrection. The Apostle John affirms:“These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life”(1 John 5:13).Thus, the Christian Gospel offers not only the possibility but the certainty of eternal life for those who believe in Christ. Islam, by contrast, leaves its followers under the shadow of uncertainty and even warns of an inevitable encounter with Hell.ConclusionThe Qur’an’s admission of Muhammad’s ignorance about salvation (Qur’an 46:9) and its universal warning of Hell for all people (Qur’an 19:71) stand in profound tension with the Christian doctrine of assurance in Christ. While Islam offers no guarantee of paradise, the Gospel of Jesus Christ promises forgiveness, reconciliation with God, and eternal life to all who believe in Him. Therefore, there is no salvation outside of Jesus Christ.📚ReferencesThe Qur’an, Surah al-Ahqaf 46:9; Surah Maryam 19:71.The Holy Bible, John 14:6; 1 John 5:13.Ibn Kathir,Tafsir al-Qur’an al-‘Azim.Al-Tabari,Jami‘ al-Bayan fi Ta’wil al-Qur’an.",

Several Qur’anic passages explicitly warn Muslims not to take Christians, Jews, or other non-believers asawliya(friends, protectors, or allies). The exegetical and theological implications of these passages have historically shaped Islamic attitudes towards interfaith relations. This article critically examines these injunctions, their interpretations, and their moral implications, particularly in light of deception (taqiyya) and duplicity, which bear striking resemblance to what Scripture identifies as satanic qualities.Qur’anic Injunctions Against Friendship with Non-MuslimsThe Qur’an repeatedly instructs Muslims to avoid deep bonds of friendship and alliance with non-Muslims. For example:“O you who believe! Do not take the Jews and the Christians as awliya (friends or allies). They are allies of each other. And whoever among you takes them as allies is surely one of them. Indeed, Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.”(Qur’an 5:51).1“Let not the believers take disbelievers as allies instead of the believers. And whoever does that has nothing to do with Allah, unless you guard yourselves against them cautiously (except by way of precaution).”(Qur’an 3:28).2The Arabic termawliyacarries a range of meanings including “friends,” “protectors,” “patrons,” and “allies.” Classical exegetes such as Ibn Kathir emphasize that these verses are prohibitive, warning Muslims against political or emotional loyalty to Jews and Christians, while Al-Tabari underscores that taking them as protectors is tantamount to betraying Islamic faith itself.3The Principle of Deception (Taqiyya)The Qur’an (3:28) introduces a notable clause—“unless you guard yourselves against them cautiously”—which Muslim jurists have interpreted as legitimizing deception under certain circumstances. This doctrine, known astaqiyya, was historically systematized within Shi‘a Islam but also finds application among Sunnis in cases of necessity.4It allows Muslims to conceal their true beliefs or intentions when under threat, or in situations where outward friendship with non-Muslims might serve protective or strategic purposes.5Thus, the Islamic teaching can be summarized as follows:Muslims are forbidden to take non-Muslims as sincere friends.If forced by circumstance, they may outwardly pretend friendliness while inwardly harboring rejection or hostility.This duplicity is considered permissible as a safeguard for faith and community.Such a framework not only discourages genuine interfaith trust but also normalizes suspicion and hidden animosity in religious encounters.The Satanic Characteristics of DeceptionTheologically, this teaching raises profound moral concerns. Christianity identifies deception, lying, and hatred as the very attributes of Satan. Jesus describes Satan as“a liar and the father of lies”(John 8:44).6The Apostle Paul similarly warns that Satan disguises himself as an angel of light, using deception as his primary weapon (2 Corinthians 11:14).7When Muslims are taught to conceal their true intentions, feign friendship, and harbor inward hostility, these behaviors echo what Scripture characterizes as satanic attributes:Deception– Satan deceived Eve in the Garden (Genesis 3:4–5).8Duplicity– Satan masquerades as light while working evil (2 Corinthians 11:14).7Hatred– Satan fosters enmity and discord among humanity (Ephesians 6:12).9The Qur’anic teaching that authorizes deception towards non-Muslims therefore appears ethically and spiritually problematic, aligning with the properties of Satan rather than the God of truth and love revealed in Christ.The Christian ContrastIn contrast, the Christian Scriptures command believers to love all people, including enemies:“But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you”(Matthew 5:44).10The Apostle Paul exhorts Christians to live peaceably with all (Romans 12:18)11and to extend kindness and compassion universally (Ephesians 4:32).12Unlike the Qur’an, which permits hostility hidden beneath pretended friendship, the Bible calls for integrity, transparency, and sincerity in all relationships. True friendship and genuine love are not contingent upon religious identity but flow from the nature of God Himself, who“so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son”(John 3:16).13ConclusionThe Qur’anic prohibition against befriending non-Muslims, coupled with the sanctioning of deception (taqiyya), raises serious ethical and theological concerns. It fosters division, distrust, and enmity, while embodying traits Scripture attributes to Satan—deception, duplicity, and hatred. By contrast, the Gospel of Christ promotes universal love, honesty, and reconciliation. This divergence underscores the incompatibility between the Islamic doctrine of conditional, deceptive friendship and the Christian ethic of genuine love and truth.BibliographyNorman L.

Muslims are taught that Allah is utterly unlike His creation:“There is nothing like unto Him”(Qur’an 42:11). Yet, paradoxically, several Qur’anic verses and Hadith traditions attribute to Allah physical attributes and organs, such as hands (Qur’an 38:75), a face (Qur’an 55:27), eyes (Qur’an 11:37), and even a shin (Qur’an 68:42). This raises a profound theological question: if Allah possesses what is described as a “shin,” how can He simultaneously claim to be wholly unlike human beings, who also possess shins?This article critically examines this contradiction, placing the Qur’anic notion of Allah’s “shin” under scrutiny while contrasting it with classical Islamic theology, Jewish and Christian theological anthropology, and logical-philosophical inquiry.The Qur’anic Description of the “Shin”The critical verse is found inSurah al-Qalam(68:42):“[Remember] the Day when the shin will be uncovered, and they will be invited to prostration but they will not be able.”Classical commentators (e.g., al-Tabari, Ibn Kathir, al-Qurtubi) debated whether the “shin” (sāq) in this passage refers literally to an organ of Allah or metaphorically to a sign of severe distress. Some schools of thought, particularly the Athari and early Hanbali traditions, insisted on affirming the attributebi-lā kayf(“without asking how”), meaning that Allah does indeed have a shin but it is unlike the human shin. Ashʿarī and Māturīdī theologians, however, leaned toward metaphorical interpretations, claiming it was an Arabic idiom for hardship.Yet, regardless of interpretation, the text introduces anthropomorphic imagery, which cannot easily be reconciled with the absolute claim of divine incomparability.The Problem of AnthropomorphismThe central contradiction lies in the following tension:Allah declares absolute dissimilarity from creation(Qur’an 42:11).Allah is described with human organs(hands, eyes, face, shin).Human beings also possess these very organs.If Allah’s shin is literal, then He shares a common attribute with humanity, thereby undermining His transcendence. If it is metaphorical, then why employ anthropomorphic language at all, when such language inevitably leads to confusion, anthropomorphism, and internal contradiction?Christian theology faced similar tensions in Old Testament anthropomorphisms (e.g., “the hand of God”), but these were ultimately resolved in the doctrine of the Incarnation: God took on human form in Jesus Christ while remaining fully divine. Islam, however, denies incarnation while still attributing physical features to Allah. This results in a theological impasse: an anthropomorphic deity who is simultaneously claimed to be beyond all human likeness.Comparative Theological ReflectionJewish Tradition:Rabbinic interpretation often treated anthropomorphic references in the Torah as metaphorical or symbolic, pointing to God’s actions rather than His physical form.Christian Tradition:Anthropomorphisms find their fulfillment in Christ, who is the “image of the invisible God” (Colossians 1:15). Here, divine embodiment is not a contradiction but the core of the Incarnation.Islamic Tradition:Islamic theology vacillates between literalism (bi-lā kayf) and metaphorical reinterpretation (ta’wīl), leaving unresolved the inherent tension between transcendence and anthropomorphism.Philosophical AnalysisFrom a philosophical standpoint, the problem can be framed as follows:Premise 1:Allah claims absolute transcendence and dissimilarity.Premise 2:Allah is described with human-like organs such as a shin.Premise 3:Humans possess shins, hands, and faces.Conclusion:Either Allah is not utterly unlike humans, or the Qur’an introduces contradictory statements.The principle of non-contradiction (Aristotle,Metaphysics, IV.3) demands consistency. If Allah’s shin is literal, He shares features with creation. If figurative, then the Qur’an’s anthropomorphic language appears misleading or incoherent, especially when taken by literalist traditions.ConclusionThe description of Allah as possessing a “shin” epitomizes the anthropomorphic dilemma within Islamic theology. While theologians have attempted to resolve the issue either through metaphorical interpretation or the doctrine ofbi-lā kayf, the contradiction remains: if Allah is unlike humans, why attribute to Him organs that are distinctly human? Christianity resolves this tension through the Incarnation of Jesus Christ, while Islam remains trapped in a paradox between transcendence and anthropomorphism. This inconsistency undermines the Islamic claim of a perfectly coherent doctrine of God.References and BibliographyPrimary SourcesQur’an 42:11, 55:27, 68:42, 11:37, 38:75Sahih al-Bukhari, Sahih Muslim– collections affirming Allah’s physical attributes.Classical TafsirAl-Tabari,Jāmiʿ al-Bayān ʿan Taʾwīl Āy al-Qurʾān.Ibn Kathir,Tafsīr al-Qur’ān al-ʿAẓīm.Al-Qurtubi,Al-Jāmiʿ li-Aḥkām al-Qur’ān.Secondary LiteratureWolfson, H.

    "full_content": "Islam and the Prophetic Fulfillment of Revelation 13By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThe Book of Revelation, particularly chapter 13, presents a prophetic vision of the end times, centering on the emergence of the Beast, the Mark of the Beast, false witnesses, and the worship of the image of the Beast. Within Christian eschatology, these symbols are understood as a climactic manifestation of rebellion against God. A close comparative reading of Islamic texts—both the Qur’an and the Hadith—reveals striking parallels between the characteristics of the Beast in Revelation and Islamic eschatological teachings. This article critically examines these correlations to argue that Revelation 13 prophetically unveils Islam as the system of the Beast.1. The Beast in Islam and RevelationIn Revelation 13:1, John describes the rise of the Beast from the sea, endowed with blasphemous authority and global power. Islam’s eschatology contains its own reference to “the Beast” (Dabbatul-ard), as found inQur’an 27:82–83, where a beast emerges to speak to mankind in the end times. Islamic tafsirs interpret this beast as a divine eschatological sign, yet in the Johannine framework, it directly parallels the Beast of Revelation who deceives nations. Rather than being a sign from God, this Islamic Beast may be understood as part of the apocalyptic rebellion prophesied in Scripture.2. The False Witness and the Denial of ChristRevelation 13:11–14 speaks of the second Beast who deceives by false testimony and miraculous pretenses. In Islam, the Qur’an insists upon false claims concerning Jesus:Qur’an 16:84–85, 4:159, andSahih al-Bukhari 2476, 3448collectively deny the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ, affirming instead a distorted Christology. This corresponds to the “false witness” of Revelation, which deceives humanity into rejecting the true Son of God. The Islamic claim that Jesus was not crucified directly contradicts the Gospel and serves as the central false testimony of Islamic doctrine, fitting the Johannine apocalyptic narrative.3. The Mark of the BeastOne of the most chilling symbols of Revelation 13 is theχξϛ(666), the mark of the Beast that permits economic and social participation while marking allegiance to the Antichrist system (Revelation 13:16–18). Parallels are drawn withQur’an 55:41, which declares that sinners will be recognized by their marks, and withSunan Ibn Majah 4066andJami at-Tirmidhi 3187, which detail eschatological markings upon the unbelievers. In this sense, the Islamic “mark” system anticipates a religiously enforced identification akin to Revelation’s prophecy, highlighting Islam’s role as the ideological framework of the Beast.4. The Image of the BeastRevelation 13:14–15 proclaims that the Beast’s image is set up and receives worship, even animating the image to speak. In Islamic eschatology, Hadith traditions provide a disturbing resonance.At-Tirmidhi vol. 2, 961andSunan Ibn Majah 2944describe images or objects associated with Islamic rituals that compel submission and obedience. This enforced veneration reflects Revelation’s warning of the “image of the Beast,” where devotion is transferred from God to a false religious system, solidifying Islam’s identification within apocalyptic prophecy.ConclusionThe composite picture painted by Revelation 13—the Beast, the False Witness, the Mark, and the Image—finds uncanny parallels in Islamic scripture and tradition. While Islam presents these figures as signs of divine authority, a Christian eschatological reading reveals them instead as the very fulfillment of apocalyptic warnings. Revelation 13 does not merely predict a vague future enemy; it identifies Islam as the embodiment of the Beast system, deceiving nations, denying the Son of God, and preparing humanity for the climactic confrontation between Christ and Antichrist.Therefore, Revelation 13 is not a distant or abstract prophecy—it is a precise unveiling of Islam’s role in the eschatological rebellion against the true and living God.",

    "full_content": "Was Muhammad Demonically Influenced? A Critical ExaminationBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThe question of Muhammad’s spiritual experiences has been debated for centuries. While Muslims hold him as the “Seal of the Prophets,” many early reports—including those from Islamic sources—raise serious questions about the origin of his revelations. This article critically examines the nature of Muhammad’s experiences, his own confessions of fear and confusion, and the moral consequences of his teachings, in light of biblical and historical evidence.Muhammad’s Early Experiences: Poet or Possessed?Islamic historical records state that when Muhammad first received “revelation” in the Cave of Hira, he was left terrified, trembling, and even contemplating suicide. The Qur’an itself records Muhammad’s accusers labeling him asmajnun(possessed by jinn) and a poet:“By your Lord’s grace, you are not mad [majnun].”(Qur’an 68:2)“Or do they say, ‘He is possessed’ (majnun)? Nay, he has brought them the truth.”(Qur’an 23:70)Sahih Hadith and theSirah(biography of Muhammad) recount how Muhammad feared he was possessed when he first encountered the spirit in Hira. Ibn Ishaq, the earliest biographer of Muhammad, writes that Muhammad said:“I thought I was possessed by a jinn, and I wished to throw myself down from a mountain.” (Ibn Ishaq,Sirat Rasul Allah, trans. Guillaume, p. 106)The Manifestations: Convulsions, Snorting, and FoamingThe Hadith record peculiar physical symptoms when Muhammad received revelation. These include twitching, foaming at the mouth, and roaring like a camel. Sahih al-Bukhari narrates:“Sometimes the revelation comes to me like the ringing of a bell… and sometimes the angel comes to me in the form of a man and talks to me and I grasp whatever he says.” (Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 1, Book 1, Hadith 2)Another narration states:“Revelation would descend upon him on an extremely cold day, and yet sweat would be dripping from his forehead.” (Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 1, Book 1, Hadith 2)These symptoms bear closer resemblance to spirit possession described in the New Testament (cf. Mark 9:17–18) than to the orderly and peaceful communication between God and His prophets.Moral Contradictions in Muhammad’s LifeIf Muhammad was indeed sent by God, his life and teachings should align with divine holiness. However, troubling actions attributed to him include:Child Marriage– Marriage to Aisha, reportedly at age six, consummated at age nine (Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 7, Book 62, Hadith 64).Domestic Violence– Qur’an 4:34 permits men to “strike” their wives if they are disobedient.Contradiction of Prior Revelation– Muhammad affirmed the Torah and the Gospel (Qur’an 5:46–48), yet his teachings directly contradicted them, especially concerning the crucifixion of Jesus (Qur’an 4:157).Would a holy God endorse such actions and contradictions?The Biblical Warning: Another GospelThe Apostle Paul warned against any “other gospel” preached, even by an angel:“But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed.” (Galatians 1:8)Muhammad’s teachings deny Christ’s divinity, crucifixion, and resurrection—all essential doctrines of salvation. By biblical standards, Muhammad introduced “another Jesus” and “another gospel” (2 Corinthians 11:4).ConclusionThe evidence from the Qur’an, Hadith, andSirashows Muhammad himself feared possession, while his physical manifestations resembled demonic influence. His moral life and teachings raise serious doubts about divine origin, especially when weighed against the holiness of God revealed in the Bible. For these reasons, Muhammad cannot be considered a true prophet of God. Instead, the biblical warning of deception through false prophets and false gospels appears directly relevant to his case.ReferencesThe Qur’an (68:2; 23:70; 5:46–48; 4:157).Ibn Ishaq.The Life of Muhammad: A Translation of Ibn Ishaq's Sirat Rasul Allah.

    "full_content": "Christian Theological Reflection: Prayer Fulfilled in ChristThe contrast between the Qur’an, Hadith, and the Christian faith reveals more than a historical or textual contradiction—it demonstrates the unique sufficiency of Jesus Christ. In Islam, prayer is a ritual burden, shaped by human tradition and inconsistent revelations. In Christianity, prayer is the fruit of a reconciled relationship with God through Christ.Jesus Himself modeled prayer, not as a mechanical ritual, but as intimate communion with the Father. He withdrew to pray (Luke 5:16), taught His disciples to pray simply and directly (Matthew 6:9–13), and interceded for His followers (John 17). Prayer, in the Christian vision, is not about rigid times or quantities, but about living continually in God’s presence (1 Thessalonians 5:17).Moreover, through His death and resurrection, Christ opened direct access to God:“For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.”(1 Timothy 2:5)Unlike Muhammad’s story—where Allah’s command had to be negotiated down through Moses—Christ is Himself the final Mediator. He fulfilled the law, including all ritual obligations, and granted believers bold access to God’s throne of grace (Hebrews 4:16).Thus, prayer in Christianity is not a ritualistic duty to earn divine favor, but a privilege of children approaching their Father (Romans 8:15). The believer prays in freedom, empowered by the Holy Spirit, not compelled by burdensome regulations.Final ConclusionThe Qur’an prescribes three prayers, while Hadith imposes five, revealing internal contradiction and the elevation of Muhammad’s authority above Allah’s. This duality undermines Islam’s claim of pure monotheism and exposes its dependence on human tradition rather than divine revelation.By contrast, Christianity offers a coherent and liberating vision of prayer. In Christ, believers are freed from ritual legalism and invited into unbroken fellowship with God. Prayer becomes not a burdensome obligation negotiated between prophets and God, but a joyful response to divine love made possible by the cross.Therefore, where Islam binds its followers to the conflicting commands of Qur’an and Hadith, Christ calls His people to the freedom of direct communion with God—“in spirit and in truth” (John 4:24).📖Extended References (Christian Perspective)The Holy Bible: Daniel 6:10; Matthew 6:9–13; Luke 5:16; John 4:24; John 17; Acts 3:1; Romans 8:15; 1 Thessalonians 5:17; 1 Timothy 2:5; Hebrews 4:16.Andrew Murray,With Christ in the School of Prayer(1885).Timothy Keller,Prayer: Experiencing Awe and Intimacy with God(2014).",

    "full_content": "The Contradiction of Muhammad’s Alleged Heavenly Journey and the Obligation of PrayerBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionOne of the most defining pillars of Islamic practice isSalat(ritual prayer). Muslims today pray five times a day as a central act of worship and as a sign of obedience to Allah. The traditional narrative links this fivefold obligation to Muhammad’s alleged heavenly journey (al-Isra’ wal-Mi’raj), in which Allah is said to have commanded prayer. Yet, when we examine the Qur’an—the supposed revealed word of Allah—we encounter an unexpected contradiction. The Qur’an clearly speaks of three daily prayer times, not five. This chapter explores the origins of this discrepancy, the role of Hadith in reshaping Islamic ritual practice, and the theological implications of Muslims following Muhammad’s word over Allah’s.The Qur’anic Mandate: Three Daily PrayersThe Qur’an frequently exhorts believers to establish prayer (aqim al-salat), but the specific times mentioned are strikingly few.Morning Prayer (Fajr)“So glorify Allah when you enter the morning and when you enter the evening.”(Surah Ar-Rum 30:17)Evening Prayer (Maghrib)“Establish prayer at the two ends of the day and at the approach of the night.”(Surah Hud 11:114)Night Prayer (Isha)“Establish the prayer at the decline of the sun until the darkness of the night, and the recitation of dawn.”(Surah Al-Isra 17:78)From these passages, a clear pattern emerges:three obligatory times of prayer—morning, evening, and night.Early commentators such as al-Tabari and Fakhr al-Din al-Razi acknowledged these verses but later reconciled them with the Hadith tradition to justify five prayers.The Qur’an itself never explicitly commands five daily prayers. Therefore, the fivefold system rests entirely on post-Qur’anic tradition.The Hadith Narrative: Muhammad’s Negotiated RevelationAccording toSahih BukhariandSahih Muslim, the five prayers originated in Muhammad’s alleged journey through the heavens. Initially, Allah demanded fifty prayers a day. Muhammad, descending from heaven, was advised by Moses to request reductions. After several rounds of bargaining, Allah settled on five.Several issues emerge from this narrative:Allah’s Inconsistency– A supposedly omniscient deity first commands fifty prayers, then reduces them upon negotiation, which undermines divine perfection.Moses’ Superior Wisdom– Moses, not Muhammad, appears as the wise counselor, making the ritual obligation more practical.Contradiction with the Qur’an– While the Qur’an prescribes three prayers, the Hadith insists on five.This reveals the Hadith’s role as a corrective to the Qur’an, raising the question:Which holds ultimate authority—Allah’s revelation or Muhammad’s tradition?Historical Development of Islamic PrayerEarly Islamic history provides additional evidence of threefold prayer. Scholars such as Joseph Schacht and Patricia Crone note that early Muslims likely adapted prayer patterns from Jewish communities in Arabia, where morning and evening prayers were common. Christians, too, practiced regular prayer at set hours, often three times daily (cf. Daniel 6:10; Acts 3:1).The fivefold system appears to have solidified later, under the influence of Hadith codification in the 8th–9th centuries CE. The reliance on oral traditions, many collected over a century after Muhammad’s death, reveals how ritual practice in Islam evolved to emphasize Muhammad’s authority over and above the Qur’an.Theological ContradictionsThe discrepancy between the Qur’an and the Hadith creates several theological dilemmas:Authority Crisis– If Allah revealed three prayers in the Qur’an, but Muhammad later imposed five through Hadith, then Muhammad becomes a co-legislator with Allah.Reliability of Revelation– A perfect God should not contradict Himself. If the Qur’an is final revelation, it should not require supplementation by Hadith.Muslim Obedience– In practice, Muslims obey Muhammad’s words (Hadith) more than Allah’s (Qur’an). This elevates Muhammad to near-divine authority.This duality resembles a form ofditheism—the recognition of two sources of law, Allah and Muhammad, both competing for supremacy.Comparative Perspective: Prayer in Judaism and ChristianityUnderstanding Islamic prayer in a broader religious context highlights its derivative nature.Judaism: The Hebrew Bible records Daniel prayingthree times a day(Daniel 6:10). Rabbinic Judaism later establishedShacharit(morning),Mincha(afternoon), andMaariv(evening), a threefold pattern strikingly similar to the Qur’an’s prescriptions.Christianity: Early Christians continued Jewish prayer cycles, often praying morning, noon, and evening. Acts 3:1 records Peter and John going to the temple “at the hour of prayer,” which was the ninth hour (afternoon). Monastic communities expanded this into seven canonical hours, but the threefold system remained a biblical base.Islam: The Qur’an reflects the same threefold tradition. The fivefold prayer system introduced later via Hadith appears as an expansion, lacking Qur’anic foundation.Thus, Islam’s practice is best understood as a divergence from the Jewish-Christian pattern, driven more by Hadith tradition than divine revelation.Hadith Reliability and Its ProblemsThe reliance on Hadith for five daily prayers exposes a broader issue: the questionable reliability of Hadith literature. Compiled over a century after Muhammad’s death, Hadith collections were subject to fabrication, political influence, and sectarian conflict.Even Muslim scholars such as al-Bukhari rejected hundreds of thousands of reports as spurious before producing his “authentic” collection. Yet, the very fact that Hadith are needed to supplement or even override the Qur’an raises questions about whether Islam’s central rituals rest on divine authority at all.ConclusionThe contradiction between the Qur’an’s instruction of three daily prayers and the Hadith’s imposition of five highlights a central flaw within Islamic theology. If Allah’s Qur’an is truly sufficient, why must Hadith dictate central acts of worship? The Mi’raj story, far from being evidence of divine majesty, exposes inconsistency, negotiation, and human intervention in shaping Islam’s most fundamental practices.In the end, Muslims are faced with a choice: obey Allah’s Qur’an, which commands three prayers, or obey Muhammad’s Hadith, which commands five. The overwhelming preference for Hadith demonstrates that in practice, Muslims follow Muhammad over Allah. This undermines the claim of Islam as a purely monotheistic religion and reveals the human construction at its core.📖ReferencesThe Qur’an: Surah Hud 11:114; Surah Al-Isra 17:78; Surah Ar-Rum 30:17–18; Surah Taha 20:130.Sahih Bukhari, Book 8, Hadith 345.Sahih Muslim, Book 1, Hadith 309.Joseph Schacht,The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence(Oxford University Press, 1950).Patricia Crone & Michael Cook,Hagarism: The Making of the Islamic World(Cambridge University Press, 1977).W.

This saving message, proclaimed by the apostles, is the essence of Christianity and the basis of salvation: “For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast” (Ephesians 2:8–9, KJV).In contrast, the Quran presents an alternate narrative regarding the Gospel (Injeel). While it claims to affirm the revelation of the Injeel to Jesus (Surah 5:46), the Quran simultaneously denies the core tenets of the biblical Gospel, namely the crucifixion, resurrection, and divine Sonship of Christ. This creates an irreconcilable contradiction between the Christian Scriptures and the Quranic claims.The Quranic Denial of CrucifixionThe death and resurrection of Jesus Christ are indispensable to Christian theology. Paul emphasizes that “if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins” (1 Corinthians 15:17, KJV). Yet, the Quran explicitly denies this historical reality:“That they said (in boast), ‘We killed Christ Jesus the son of Mary, the Messenger of Allah’—but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but so it was made to appear to them…” (Surah 4:157, Yusuf Ali).By rejecting the crucifixion, the Quran undermines the doctrine of atonement, leaving no theological basis for the forgiveness of sins. In contrast, the Bible repeatedly testifies that Jesus “was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification” (Romans 4:25, KJV).The Quranic Denial of the Sonship of ChristAnother central teaching of the New Testament is that Jesus is the Son of God, coequal with the Father (John 10:30; Hebrews 1:1–3). At His baptism, God the Father declared, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased” (Matthew 3:17, KJV).Yet, the Quran emphatically denies this truth:“It is not befitting to (the majesty of) Allah that He should beget a son. Glory be to Him!” (Surah 19:35, Yusuf Ali).“Christ Jesus the son of Mary was (no more than) a messenger of Allah…” (Surah 4:171, Yusuf Ali).This denial stands in direct opposition to the biblical witness. If Jesus is not the Son of God, then His role as Savior and Mediator is nullified, contradicting His own claims: “I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me” (John 14:6, KJV).The Warning Against “Another Gospel”The Apostle Paul sternly warned believers against accepting any message that distorts the Gospel of Christ:“I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel: which is not another… But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed” (Galatians 1:6–8, KJV).By denying the crucifixion, resurrection, and divine Sonship of Christ, the Quran presents precisely “another gospel,” which Paul condemns. This indicates that the Quran cannot be from the God of the Bible, and Muhammad cannot be regarded as a prophet of the true God since his message contradicts the apostolic witness.ConclusionThe Injeel of the Quran is not the true Gospel but a counterfeit narrative that contradicts the essential truths of Christianity. The God revealed in Jesus Christ is not the Allah of the Quran, and Muhammad cannot be considered a genuine prophet of God since his teachings deny the very foundations of salvation history.The authentic Gospel remains unchanging: Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God, died for our sins, was buried, and rose again the third day according to the Scriptures (1 Corinthians 15:3–4). Any denial of this truth is a rejection of God’s revelation, for “there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved” but the name of Jesus (Acts 4:12, KJV).ReferencesThe Holy Bible, King James Version (KJV).The Quran.Translations by Abdullah Yusuf Ali.1 Corinthians 15:1–4; Romans 4:25; Ephesians 2:8–9; John 14:6; Acts 4:12.Surah 4:157; Surah 4:171; Surah 5:46; Surah 19:35.",

The Quran denies the crucifixion of Jesus (Surah 4:157), claiming that He was not killed but rather someone else was made to resemble Him. Furthermore, it rejects the Sonship of Christ, insisting instead that He was merely a prophet and servant of Allah. This stands in direct contradiction to the New Testament witness, where Jesus openly affirms His divine Sonship (John 10:30; John 14:6) and where the Father declares, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased” (Matthew 3:17, KJV).The denial of the crucifixion and resurrection undermines the very core of the Gospel message. Without the cross and the resurrection, there is no atonement for sin, no victory over death, and no assurance of eternal life. The Apostle Paul warns against “another gospel” (Galatians 1:6–9), affirming that any deviation from the true Gospel is a distortion not inspired by God. Thus, the Quranic portrayal of the Injeel cannot be considered a genuine continuation or revelation from the same God who spoke through the Law, the Prophets, the Psalms, and ultimately through His Son Jesus Christ (Hebrews 1:1–2).Consequently, if the Quran denies the crucifixion, resurrection, and Sonship of Christ, it positions itself outside the divine revelation of God. Allah, as presented in the Quran, cannot be equated with the God of the Bible, and Muhammad, in delivering a message contrary to the Gospel of Christ, cannot be regarded as a true prophet. The authentic Gospel remains the unchanging truth: that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died for our sins, was buried, and rose again for our justification.",

    "full_content": "Jesus is Not Isa bin Maryam: A Theological and Historical Challenge to Islamic ChristologyBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis paper explores the sharp distinction between the Jesus of the New Testament and the Isa bin Maryam of the Qur’an. While Christianity identifies Jesus as the eternal Son of God, crucified and resurrected for humanity’s salvation, Islam presents Isa as a mortal prophet, denied of crucifixion, stripped of divine identity, and positioned as a forerunner of Muhammad. By analyzing scriptural evidence, historical witness, and theological implications, this study argues that Isa is not Jesus. Instead, Isa represents a seventh-century Islamic reconstruction of Christ’s figure, detached from historical foundations and apostolic testimony.1. IntroductionThe question of who Jesus is remains the dividing line between Christianity and Islam. Christians confess Jesus as the Christ, Son of the living God (Matthew 16:16), the incarnate Word (John 1:14), and the Savior of the world (John 4:42). Islam, however, identifies Jesus with Isa bin Maryam, a prophet in the Qur’an who was neither divine nor crucified, but merely a messenger who prepared the way for Muhammad.The importance of clarifying this distinction cannot be overstated. If Jesus and Isa are not the same, then interfaith assertions that Christians and Muslims worship the same figure are theologically misleading. This article demonstrates, through historical, textual, and doctrinal analysis, that Jesus of Nazareth is not Isa of the Qur’an.2. Eyewitness Testimony and the Principle of Verification2.1 Biblical Eyewitness TestimonyThe New Testament rests on multiple eyewitness testimonies:Matthew, a disciple, records the crucifixion and resurrection.John, “the disciple whom Jesus loved,” presents theological reflections grounded in firsthand experience (John 21:24).Paul, though not an immediate disciple, encountered the risen Christ and corroborated earlier apostolic testimony (1 Corinthians 15:3–8).The New Testament documents were written within the lifetime of eyewitnesses (30–90 CE), offering historical credibility.2.2 Qur’anic Non-Eyewitness AccountBy contrast, the Qur’an was revealed to Muhammad (610–632 CE), centuries after Jesus’ ministry. Muhammad never encountered Jesus, nor did any eyewitness of Jesus inform him directly. The Isa narrative derives from oral traditions, apocryphal writings, and theological constructs circulating in Arabia.Ironically, the Qur’an itself states: “Bring two witnesses from among your men” (Qur’an 2:282). Yet the Qur’an offers no eyewitness to validate Isa’s story. Thus, the Qur’an fails its own epistemic requirement for truth verification.3. The Identity of Jesus Versus Isa3.1 Jesus as the Word and Son of GodChristianity confesses:“The Word became flesh” (John 1:14).Jesus is the “Son of God” (John 10:36).“Our great God and Savior Jesus Christ” (Titus 2:13).Jesus is not merely a prophet; He is divine, the eternal Logos incarnate.3.2 Isa as a Created ProphetIslam, however, describes Isa as:A prophet like Adam, created from dust (Qur’an 3:59).Not a son of God (Qur’an 17:111).Not Allah, but a messenger (Qur’an 4:171).This Isa cannot be reconciled with the biblical Jesus. The Qur’an reduces Him to a mortal servant, denying His divine sonship and role in salvation history.4. Crucifixion, Resurrection, and Atonement4.1 Jesus’ Death and ResurrectionThe crucifixion of Jesus is central to Christian theology:“Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures” (1 Corinthians 15:3).“The blood of Jesus… cleanses us from all sin” (1 John 1:7).Jesus declared, “It is finished” (John 19:30).Without crucifixion and resurrection, there is no Christian Gospel (1 Corinthians 15:17).4.2 Islamic Denial of CrucifixionThe Qur’an denies the crucifixion: “They did not kill him, nor crucify him, but it was made to appear so to them” (Qur’an 4:157). Isa escapes death, and thus, in Islam, there is no atonement. This denial undermines the historical consensus, as even secular historians affirm Jesus’ crucifixion as one of the best-attested facts of antiquity.5. Eschatology: Jesus the King Versus Isa the Herald of Muhammad5.1 Jesus as King of KingsRevelation 17:14 declares: “The Lamb will triumph… for He is Lord of lords and King of kings.” Jesus is enthroned as sovereign over all creation.5.2 Isa as Servant of MuhammadIslam subordinates Isa to Muhammad: “O Children of Israel, I am the messenger of Allah to you, confirming what was before me in the Torah and bringing good tidings of a messenger to come after me, whose name is Ahmad” (Qur’an 61:6).Here Isa’s mission is reframed—not as Redeemer, but as forerunner to Muhammad. Such a view diminishes the biblical Christ and distorts His messianic role.6. Theological ImplicationsAuthority of Scripture:The New Testament rests on apostolic eyewitness; the Qur’an on non-historical revelation.Nature of Christ:Jesus is divine; Isa is mortal.Salvation:Jesus saves through His death and resurrection; Isa offers no salvation.Eschatology:Jesus reigns as eternal King; Isa submits to Muhammad.These divergences reveal that Isa is not Jesus but a theological invention serving Islamic claims.7. ConclusionThe evidence is clear: Jesus of the New Testament cannot be equated with Isa bin Maryam of the Qur’an. Christianity presents Jesus as the eternal Son of God, crucified and risen for the redemption of mankind. Islam presents Isa as a prophet who denies crucifixion, sonship, and divinity, ultimately serving to legitimize Muhammad.Therefore, Muslims who claim to honor Jesus through Isa are venerating a different figure. To know the true Jesus is to know Him as He is revealed in the Gospels: the Son of God, the Savior, and the risen Lord. Anything less is a distortion.ReferencesBiblical SourcesThe Holy Bible, New International Version (NIV).Luke 2:12; John 1:14; Mark 16:6; John 10:36; Matthew 27:32–50; John 19:30; 1 John 1:7; Philippians 2:5–6; Titus 2:13; Revelation 17:14; 1 Corinthians 15:3–8.Qur’anic SourcesQur’an 2:282; Qur’an 3:59; Qur’an 3:32; Qur’an 4:157–158; Qur’an 4:171; Qur’an 17:111; Qur’an 19:22–25; Qur’an 19:35; Qur’an 61:6.Secondary SourcesBrown, Raymond E.The Death of the Messiah.

    "full_content": "Jesus is Not Isa bin Maryam: A Theological and Historical Challenge to Islamic ChristologyBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThe identity of Jesus Christ stands at the center of both Christian and Islamic theology, yet the portrayals diverge in irreconcilable ways. Christianity affirms Jesus as the eternal Son of God, the Word made flesh (John 1:14), who was crucified, buried, and rose from the dead (Mark 16:6). Islam, on the other hand, presents Isa bin Maryam (ʿĪsā ibn Maryam) as a human prophet, neither crucified nor divine, whose story was written in the Qur’an over six centuries after the events of the New Testament. This article contends that Jesus of the Gospels is not the same as Isa of the Qur’an.1. Eyewitness Testimony Versus Late Non-Eyewitness AccountsThe New Testament provides multiple independent eyewitness testimonies to the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus. The Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John), along with apostolic letters, present historically verifiable claims grounded in first-century Palestine.Jesus was born in Bethlehem (Luke 2:12).Jesus was crucified under Pontius Pilate (Matthew 27:32–50).Jesus rose bodily from the grave (Mark 16:6).Jesus claimed unity with the Father (John 10:36).By contrast, the Qur’an (compiled c. 650 CE) presents Isa bin Maryam, not based on eyewitnesses, but mediated through Muhammad, who lived centuries after Christ. This Isa was:Conceived under a palm tree (Qur’an 19:22–25).Not crucified but replaced (Qur’an 4:157).Denied divine sonship (Qur’an 17:111).Thus, whereas the Christian Gospel stands upon historical witness, the Qur’anic Isa arises from a late theological reinterpretation without historical grounding.2. The Nature of Jesus versus IsaChristianity presents Jesus as divine:“The Word became flesh and dwelt among us” (John 1:14).“Christ Jesus, who being in very nature God” (Philippians 2:5–6).“Our great God and Savior Jesus Christ” (Titus 2:13).Conversely, Islam denies divinity to Isa, insisting:“Isa was only a messenger” (Qur’an 4:171).“It is not befitting to Allah that He should beget a son” (Qur’an 19:35).This is not merely a difference in interpretation; it is a fundamental contradiction. Jesus’ divinity is attested by His works, His resurrection, and apostolic testimony. Isa, as portrayed in the Qur’an, is reduced to a prophet, stripped of his divine identity.3. Crucifixion and AtonementThe crucifixion of Jesus is central to Christian faith:“Christ died for our sins” (1 Corinthians 15:3).“The blood of Jesus… cleanses us from all sin” (1 John 1:7).Jesus declared, “It is finished” on the cross (John 19:30).Islam denies the crucifixion:“They did not kill him, nor crucify him, but it was made to appear so to them” (Qur’an 4:157).If Isa did not die, there can be no atonement, no resurrection, and no salvation in the Christian sense. The denial of the cross undermines the very heart of the biblical Gospel, further proving that Isa is not the Jesus proclaimed by the apostles.4. Isa as Muhammad’s Forerunner Versus Jesus as the King of KingsIn Christianity, Jesus is the fulfillment of prophecy and the “King of Kings and Lord of Lords” (Revelation 17:14). In Islam, Isa is presented as the prophet who foretold Muhammad:“Isa brought Muhammad as the last prophet” (Qur’an 61:6).This distortion recasts Isa into an Islamic framework, making him subservient to Muhammad rather than sovereign over all creation. It is an appropriation of Jesus’ identity for the service of another prophet, demonstrating that Isa is a constructed figure, not the historical Jesus.ConclusionJesus of Nazareth, Son of God, crucified and risen, is not Isa bin Maryam of the Qur’an. The Jesus of history and the New Testament stands upon multiple eyewitness testimonies, fulfilling prophecy, and offering salvation through His blood. Isa of the Qur’an, on the other hand, is a later theological invention, stripped of divinity, crucifixion, and resurrection, and used to validate Muhammad’s prophethood.Therefore, Muslims who claim to honor Jesus by equating Him with Isa do not in fact know Him. The biblical Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God (Matthew 16:16), while Isa is a distant echo, an altered construct that cannot save.ReferencesBiblical ReferencesThe Holy Bible, New International Version (NIV).Luke 2:12; John 1:14; Mark 16:6; John 10:36; Matthew 27:32–50; John 19:30; 1 John 1:7; Philippians 2:5–6; Titus 2:13; Revelation 17:14.Qur’anic ReferencesQur’an 4:157–158; Qur’an 4:171; Qur’an 17:111; Qur’an 19:22–25; Qur’an 19:35; Qur’an 61:6; Qur’an 3:59; Qur’an 3:32.Secondary SourcesBrown, Raymond E.The Death of the Messiah.

    "full_content": "Rebecca, Sarah, and the “Child-Bride” Argument: a careful textual and historical rebuttalBy Dr Maxwell Shimba — Shimba Theological InstituteAbstract.Some modern apologists (including a number of Muslim polemicists) have argued that the Hebrew Bible presents Rebecca (Rivkah) as a child bride — allegedly born only after Sarah’s death and thus only a few years old when Isaac married her — and they use that reading to defend or relativize early marriage in other traditions. This article examines the biblical text, the traditional Jewish chronological reconstructions, and the logic of the claim. I show that the biblical narrative doesnotsupport the assertion that Rebecca was a toddler at marriage; the claim depends on speculative chronological squeezes or selective readings of post-biblical traditions and therefore fails as an historical or hermeneutical defense of child marriage.1. The plain biblical facts (what the text actually says)Three simple, directly stated data points in Genesis are central:Sarah’s death and age are explicitly recorded: “Sarah lived 127 years; these were the years of Sarah’s life. And Sarah died in Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan.” (Gen. 23). (Bible Gateway)The narrative describing the finding and bringing of Rebecca as Isaac’s wife is Gen. 24; Rebecca is portrayed performing adult tasks (drawing water, speaking decisively, accompanying the servant with her maidens), and the servant treats her as marriageable. (Bible Gateway)The text gives Isaac’s age at marriage: “And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to be his wife.” (Gen. 25:20). (Bible Gateway)Taken together, the canonical narrative nowhere records Rebecca’s year of birth. The text depicts Rebecca as a fully capable young woman at the time she meets Abraham’s servant (she draws water for camels, speaks, acts with agency, and travels with her maids), and it explicitly states Isaac’s age at marriage. The silence of the text about Rebecca’s precise birth year is crucial: it means any numeric claim about her being an infant or toddler at marriage must come from inference or from later tradition, not from the biblical narrative itself. (Bible Gateway)2. Where the “3-year” claim comes from (tradition and arithmetic)The claim that Rebecca was three (or very young) when she married Isaac originates not in Genesis itself but in later chronological reconstructions and some medieval rabbinic readings. Certain rabbinic sources (and later compilers who tried to make a continuous chronology) place events in ways that can produce a small numeric gap between Sarah’s death and Isaac’s marriage; some medieval commentators record traditions that lead to very young ages for Rebecca. Notably, Rashi and some midrashic strands are sometimes cited in discussions about Rebecca’s age. But these areinterpretationsor chronologies layered upon the text, not explicit biblical statements. (Wikipedia)Two methodological cautions:Chronological compression.The patriarchal narratives are episodic; many years may pass between narrated scenes (the biblical narrator regularly telescopes time). Inferring precise birth years from such telescoped narratives is risky. (Bible Gateway)Variety of traditions.Different Jewish traditions give different ages for Rebecca (reports range widely — medieval sources themselves disagree), which shows the lack of a single authoritative ancient numerical tradition. (Wikipedia)3. Textual (narrative) reasons why Rebecca could not plausibly be a toddlerBeyond the absence of an explicit birth year, the narrative contains elements incompatible with Rebecca being an infant:Active, adult behavior.Rebecca goes to a well, draws water, offers to water camels (a substantial, physically demanding task), interacts confidently with a stranger, and manages travel with her maidens. These are actions of a mature adolescent or young woman, not a child. Gen. 24’s portrait of Rebecca reads as a mature, marriageable woman. (Bible Gateway)Marriage customs and textual portrayal.The story treats marriage as an affair involving family negotiations, blessings, and travel with attendants; Genesis 24 repeatedly frames Rebecca as a bride-figure with social standing rather than as a dependent infant. (Bible Gateway)Hence the plain sense (and the narrative cues) support reading Rebecca as a marriageable young woman rather than a toddler.4. Why citing Rebecca as a precedent for child marriage is exegetically unsoundModern polemical uses of the Rebecca-argument typically proceed by (a) combining chronological assumptions about Sarah’s death and Isaac’s age, (b) assuming Rebecca’s birth must therefore fall in a specific narrow window, and (c) concluding she was extremely young at marriage. This chain is fragile: it depends on speculative arithmetic and on privileging one post-biblical chronologizing tradition over the clear narrative picture. Because the biblical text itself does not report Rebecca’s age and because different traditions disagree, the argument cannot bear the weight of being used as an authoritative precedent for child marriage.Scholars and careful exegetes (Jewish and Christian) therefore either reject the toddler-reading or treat it as a non-textual tradition rather than a biblical fact. In other words: the biblical text does not authorize the claim. (Bible Gateway)5. Conclusion — responsible hermeneutics and polemicsIt is understandable that contested modern practices (and accusations) produce vigorous apologetic responses. Yet scholarly and responsible hermeneutics require that conclusions be driven by the text and by careful engagement with tradition and context. The claim that Rebecca was born after Sarah’s death and was therefore a toddler-bride is not supported by the biblical narrative itself; it relies on later chronological reconstructions or selective readings of rabbinic material. As such, it is an inadequate and unsound precedent to justify or relativize child marriage in other religious traditions.If one wishes to mount an argument about historical norms for marriage, the proper route is comparative, historically grounded study of ancient Near Eastern marriage practices, legal documents, and demographic realities — not selective readings that impose modern polemical aims on ancient narrative silence.Selected bibliography and sourcesGenesis 23–25 (text and narrative: Bible Gateway editions consulted).

    "full_content": "Is Muhammad a True Prophet?A Scholarly Critical Examination from Islamic Sources**By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis chapter critically examines the prophethood claims of Muhammad usingonlyauthoritative Islamic sources—primarily the Qur’an, the Hadith literature, and the earliest biographical work,Sirat Rasul Allahby Ibn Ishaq. The objective is not to rely on external or polemical material but to allow Islam’s own textual witnesses to speak. The analysis evaluates Muhammad’s experiences, behaviours, and proclaimed revelations in relation to the biblical concept of prophetic authenticity. Key concerns emerge around Muhammad’s early life dedication, susceptibility to spiritual influences, alleged satanic inspiration, psychological instability, moral contradictions, and actions inconsistent with biblical prophetic paradigms. The evidence is arranged thematically and documented with precise citations, allowing scholars and readers to independently verify each component.**1. Dedication of Muhammad at Birth to Hubal(Ibn Ishaq,Life of Muhammad, p. 70)**Ibn Ishaq records that immediately after Muhammad’s birth, his grandfather `Abd al-Muttalib carried the infant to the center of the Ka’ba, stood before the idolHubal, and offered a prayer of thanksgiving to Allah for the child’s birth.This act places Muhammad’s earliest religious association within a polytheistic framework, contrary to biblical prophetic origins, which are invariably marked by devotion to the God of Israel from birth.Reference:Ibn Ishaq,Sirat Rasul Allah, trans. A. Guillaume, p. 70.**2. The Satanic Verses: Satan Placed Words in Muhammad’s Mouth(Ibn Ishaq, pp. 165–167)**The most serious challenge to Muhammad’s prophetic claims arises from thesatanic versesincident. According to Ibn Ishaq:Muhammad desired reconciliation with pagan Quraysh.In that emotional state, Satan “put upon his tongue” words praising the pagan goddesses al-Lat, al-Uzza, and Manat.Quraysh rejoiced, believing he had validated their gods.Muhammad and the Muslims prostrated together with the pagans.Gabriel later rebuked Muhammad, stating:“You have recited something I did not bring from God.”Muhammad was “grieved” and “feared God greatly.”A new revelation (Qur’an 22:52) affirmed that Satan had interfered with every prophet’s desires.This narrative acknowledges:Direct satanic influenceon Muhammad’s prophetic speech.Doctrinal correctionof a false revelation.Retractionof verses publicly proclaimed as divine.Such an episode has no precedent in biblical prophetic tradition, where God explicitly commands prophets to distinguish His words from those of false spirits (Jer. 23:16–32).**3. The Mode of Revelation: Jibril Physically Strangled Muhammad(Sahih Muslim, Vol. 1, pp. 108–110)**Muhammad’s first encounter with Gabriel is described with striking psychological and physical trauma:Gabriel seized Muhammad three times.Each time, he “pressed him so hard that he could not bear it.”Muhammad fled in terror to Khadija crying “Cover me! Cover me!”He confessed:“I fear that something may happen to me.”In contrast, biblical angelic encounters never involve strangulation or physical harm to prophets. Instead, they begin with the reassurance:“Fear not.”**4. Muhammad’s Suicidal Attempts(Sahih Bukhari, Vol. 9, pp. 83–85, Hadith 6982)**Following the cessation of revelation after Waraqa’s death, Muhammad experienced a period of profound despair:He repeatedly attempted suicide by throwing himself off mountains.Each time, Gabriel intervened at the last moment to stop him.Suicidal ideation is incompatible with biblical prophetic vocation, where prophets are upheld, strengthened, and protected by God even under duress.**5. Jibril Surgically Opened Muhammad’s Chest and Removed “Satan”(Sahih Muslim, Vol. 1, p. 116)**Hadith literature records a supernatural surgery performed on Muhammad as a child:Gabriel tore open Muhammad’s chest.He removed a black clot, saying:“This was the measure of Satan in you.”He washed the heart in Zamzam water.The implication is significant: Muhammad requiredsatanic extraction, unlike biblical prophets, who are filled with the Spirit of God from youth (e.g., Samuel, Jeremiah).**6. Muhammad Was Bewitched and Lost Cognitive Control(Sahih Bukhari, Vol. 4, p. 254, Hadith 3175)**Aisha reports:Muhammad was under a spell.He imagined doing things he had not done.This raises theological issues: a prophet whose perceptions are manipulated by sorcery contradicts biblical standards where prophets are safeguarded from such deception (Num. 23:23).**7. Muhammad Had a Jinn Companion(Sahih Muslim, Vol. 8, p. 302)**Muhammad stated:Every person has a jinn companion.He too had one.He claimed his jinn only commanded him to do good.Biblically, prophets are accompanied by the Spirit of the Lord, not jinn spirits.**8. Marriage to Aisha at Age 6; Consummation at Age 9(Sahih Muslim Vol. 4, p. 355)**Aisha states:Muhammad married her at age 6.Consummated the marriage at age 9.Muhammad was 54 years old.Such conduct conflicts with biblical morality and the standards required of spiritual leaders (1 Timothy 3:1–7).**9. Marriage to the Divorced Wife of His Adopted Son(Qur’an 33:37)**Muhammad married Zaynab bint Jahsh after Zayd, his adopted son, divorced her. The Qur’an itself records God commanding this marriage—an action inconsistent with biblical restrictions on familial boundaries.**10. Muhammad Did Not Possess the Secrets of God(Qur’an 6:50)**Muhammad himself declares that he lacks:Knowledge of the unseenAuthority to perform miraclesDivine secrets reserved by GodTrue biblical prophets such as Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel were explicitly entrusted with God’s secret counsel.**11. Muhammad Confessed Personal Sinfulness(Qur’an 40:55; 47:19; 48:1–2; 49:1–3)**The Qur’an requires Muhammad to:Seek forgiveness for his sinsConfess faultsRepentHadith sources confirm:Muhammad said there is “a shade over my heart” and he seeks forgiveness 100 times daily (Sahih Muslim 2702).His opening prayer asks God to “wash away my sins” like a soiled garment (Sahih Bukhari 744).In biblical theology, prophets are morally exemplary and do not exhibit persistent moral darkness or inherent spiritual obstruction.ConclusionFrom an academic and theological standpoint, based entirely upon Islamic textual evidence, the following conclusions emerge:Muhammad’s life displaysspiritual influences inconsistent with divine protection—including satanic interference, enchantment, and a personal jinn companion.His revelations includedemonstrable errors, later corrected by new revelations.His psychological profile as depicted in Islamic sources involvessuicidal tendencies, severe fear, and trauma.His moral actions—particularly concerning marriage and family boundaries—conflict with biblical prophetic ethics.His own confession of ignorance, sinfulness, and lack of divine secrets places him below the standard of biblical prophets.Therefore, based on the internal evidence of Islam’s own authoritative sources,Muhammad does not meet the theological, moral, or spiritual qualifications of a true prophet of God.",

    "full_content": "Miriam, Mary, and Maryam: Understanding the Differences Across Judaism, Christianity, and IslamBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba — Shimba Theological InstituteThe namesMiriam,Mary, andMaryamappear prominently across the three major Abrahamic faiths—Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Although their names share a common linguistic origin and their stories resonate with themes of faith, obedience, and divine purpose, these three women lived in different centuries, in different lands, and under different covenants. A careful study of Scripture, history, and language is essential to correctly understand their identities.This article provides an expanded comparative study of these women, exploring their backgrounds, theological significance, timelines, and the commonly debated question surrounding Maryam’s genealogy in the Qur’an.1. The Linguistic Connection: One Name, Many FormsAll three names—Miriam (מִרְיָם)in Hebrew,Maria / Mariamin Greek, andMaryam (مَرْيَم)in Arabic—come from the same Semitic root. This explains why the names look and sound similar even across cultures.Possible meanings of the nameScholars have proposed several meanings for the rootM-R-Y-M:“beloved”“rebellious”“bitter”“gift of God”Regardless of meaning, the name was extremely common in ancient Israel. Just as names likeJohnorDavidrepeat frequently in English-speaking cultures today,Miryamwas common among Jewish women for centuries.Thus, similarity of names must never be mistaken for identity of persons.2. Miriam: Prophetess and Leader of the Exodus (c. 13th–15th century BCE)Historical PeriodThe life of Miriam is set during theExodus, which most scholars date between1446 BCE(early date) and1260–1230 BCE(late date). Regardless of which dating model one follows, Miriam livedover 1,300 years before Jesusand1,900 years before Muhammad.Biblical ReferencesExodus 2:1–10– Miriam watches over the infant MosesExodus 15:20–21– She leads Israel’s women in praise after the Red Sea crossingNumbers 12– Her prophetic authority and correctionMicah 6:4– God lists Miriam alongside Moses and Aaron as leadersRole in Jewish TraditionMiriam is honored as:aprophetessaspiritual leader of Israela symbol offemale courageone of the three great leaders of the Exodus (Moses, Aaron, Miriam)Rabbinic tradition even speaks of “Miriam’s well,” miraculously providing water for Israel during the wilderness journey.Theological SignificanceMiriam’s story teaches:God uses women in leadershipProphetic authority includes accountabilityWorship and deliverance are inseparable themes in Israel's story3. Mary: Mother of Jesus (1st Century CE)Historical PeriodMary lived inNazarethin the early1st century CE, around the time of the Roman Empire. Her life is located1,400 years after Miriam.New Testament ReferencesLuke 1–2– Annunciation, Magnificat, birth of JesusMatthew 1–2– Lineage and birth narrativeJohn 19:25–27– At the foot of the CrossActs 1:14– Praying with the early ChurchChristian Theology and MaryMary is revered as:Theotokos(Mother of God) – Council of Ephesus, 431 CEThe Virgin Mother– affirming the supernatural birth of JesusA model of faith and submission(“let it be to me according to Your word”)Why Mary Is Central in ChristianityChristians honor Mary primarily because ofher relationship to Jesus—the Son of God. Her “yes” becomes a pivotal moment in salvation history. She is not worshiped but deeply respected for her role in God’s redemptive plan.4. Maryam: The Qur’anic Portrait (7th Century CE)Historical and Textual ContextThe Qur’an was revealed in7th-century Arabia, but Maryam (the mother of Isa/Jesus) is understood to have lived in the1st century CE—the same period as the New Testament Mary.Qur’anic ReferencesSurah Maryam (19)– The story of her purity, pregnancy, and birth of IsaSurah Aal Imran (3:35–47)– The “Family of Imran” and the AnnunciationSurah Anbiya (21:91)– Virgin birth affirmedMaryam’s Status in IslamMaryam is considered one of the most honored women in Islam:Only woman mentioned by name in the Qur’anGiven an entire chapterExalted as “chosen” and “purified” (3:42)A model of devotion and chastityYet, the Qur’an rejects some Christian Marian doctrinesIslam respects Mary but:Denies Jesus’ divinityDenies Mary’s title “Mother of God”Rejects any form of Marian worship or intercessionThus, Maryam in Islam and Mary in Christianity share similarities but belong to two distinct theological worlds.5. The Controversy: Did the Qur’an Confuse Miriam (sister of Moses) with Maryam (mother of Jesus)?This question arises from certain Qur’anic verses describing Maryam as:“sister of Aaron”(Surah Maryam 19:28)“daughter of Imran”(Surah Aal Imran 3:35–36)SinceMiriam, sister of Moses, was literally:daughter ofAmram (Imran in Arabic)sister ofAaron…some argue that the Qur’an mistakenly places Mary 1,400 years earlier.Christian and Jewish Critics SayThe Qur’anconfuses:Miriam (sister of Moses, 13th–15th century BCE)Mary (mother of Jesus, 1st century CE)Muslim Scholars Respond With Three ExplanationsHonorific or spiritual lineage– calling Maryam “sister of Aaron” as a title meaning “righteous woman from the priestly line of Aaron.”Genealogical identification– “daughter of Imran” is not literal but refers to being from thetribeorhouseholdof Imran.She had a brother named Aaron– some classical tafsir suggests this was a common name.Historical Analysis (Dr. Maxwell Shimba)While Muslim scholars defend the idiomatic or genealogical usage, thelinguistic and historical evidenceshows:In Jewish culture, calling someone “sister of Aaron” meant literal family connectionNo known Jewish or Christian tradition calls Mary “daughter of Amram/Imran”The name Imran appears nowhere in early Christian genealogy of MaryThe confusion likely results fromname repetition common in Israelite traditioncombined withArabic rhetorical styleThus, from a historical-critical standpoint, the Qur’anic phrasing reflects either:aliterary parallel,amisinterpretation of Jewish oral traditions, orablending of genealogical categories.6.

Final Reflection: Clarity Brings RespectConfusion over names has led to unnecessary inter-religious conflict. As scholars and Christians, we must handle texts with care, respect, and intellectual honesty.

Muslims are taught to imitate Muhammad (Qur’an 33:21), yet when we examine the earliest Islamic sources honestly and critically, deep ethical contradictions emerge.One of the most troubling examples comes from the age ofAisha at marriagecompared to Muhammad’s treatment of his own daughterFatimah.According to the most authentic Sunni texts, Muhammad married Aisha atsixand consummated the marriage atnine(Sahih al-Bukhari 5133, 5134). Muslims defend this by saying:“She matured early.”“It was normal for that culture.”“It was the Sunnah.”However, we find a stunning contradiction inside Islam’s own sources: whenAbu Bakr and Umar—the very men who later became Caliphs—wanted to marry Muhammad’s daughterFatimah, he refused. Why?Because she was“too young.”This statement comes fromSunan an-Nasa’i 3221 (Vol. 4, Book 26, Hadith 3223)—the same hadith collection Muslims consider among the six major canonical books of Islam.This raises a profound moral question:Why was Aisha mature enough at six, but Fatimah “too young” at about twelve?Fatimah was no small child. Historically and chronologically, she was:Born before the Hijrah,Significantly older than Aisha,Likely around twelveat the time Abu Bakr and Umar requested her hand.Yet Muhammad rejected their proposals, saying in summary:“She is too young.”Ifsix is acceptable, how cantwelve be too young?This exposes an inconsistency in Muhammad’s own moral reasoning. It also completely undermines modern Muslim attempts to justify child marriage based on “following the Prophet.”If Muhammad himselfdid not allowhis companions to follow his exampleeven in the 7th century, how can any Muslim today insist it is a Sunnah to be imitated in the modern world?The Problem Muslims Must AddressMuslims argue constantly that:Aisha’s marriage was normal for the time.It is part of the Sunnah and must be obeyed.Muhammad’s actions cannot be questioned.Yet MuhammadforbadeAbu Bakr and Umar from following that exact Sunnah with his own daughter.If this practice wasgood, why deny it?If it wasmoral, why reserve it only for himself?If it wasacceptable, why prevent two of Islam’s most righteous men from doing the same?The contradiction is glaring:✔ Muhammad married a six-year-old → acceptable✘ Abu Bakr and Umar requested to marry a twelve-year-old → rejectedReason: “She is too young.”This reveals a double standard rooted not in divine command, but in personal preference.Muslims in the 21st Century Must Answer HonestlyMuslims cannot hide behind the phrase “This is our religion.”Every religious claim must stand the test of:Moral reasoningHistorical consistencyHuman dignityUniversal ethicsModern Muslims who defend child marriage because “the Prophet did it” must first reconcile the fact thathe did not allow the closest men to him to imitate him.If Muhammadhimselfrefused this Sunnah, who are Muslims today to revive it?This inconsistency is not a Christian invention.It is documentedinside Islam’s own canonical texts.Annex: Relevant Hadith Sources1. Sunan an-Nasa’i 3221 (Vol. 4, Book 26, Hadith 3223)(Exact wording may vary by translator)Narrated by Umm Salamah:When Abu Bakr and then Umar asked permission to marry Fatimah, the Messenger of Allah said:“She is too young.”2. Sahih al-Bukhari 5133“The Prophet married her (Aisha) when she was six years old and consummated the marriage when she was nine…”3. Sahih Muslim 1422a“Aisha reported that Allah’s Messenger married her when she was seven… and consummated the marriage when she was nine…”Final ReflectionThe question is simple:If Muhammad himself refused to let people imitate his marriage to a child, why should Muslims defend it today?This is not an attack on Muslims.It is a call tomoral clarity,historical honesty, andthe courage to confront contradictionswithin the Islamic tradition.The truth will always stand, and truth does not fear examination.",

    "full_content": "The Theology of Baptism: A Christian Appeal to MuslimsBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteBaptism is one of the most misunderstood doctrines in the Christian faith, especially within interfaith contexts. Many assume it is only a symbolic ritual or an optional religious ceremony. However, Scripture presents baptism as a decisive moment in God’s redemptive plan—a divine act that marks the transition from spiritual death to spiritual life.For Christians addressing Muslim audiences, it is essential to explain this doctrine clearly, respectfully, and biblically. Baptism is not a Christian invention; it is a continuation of God’s pattern throughout history, where water becomes a means of salvation, renewal, and covenant identity.Baptism in the Storyline of ScriptureThe Bible consistently uses water as a symbol and instrument of divine deliverance. Peter reminds believers that Noah and his family were saved “through water” (1 Peter 3:20–21). Their obedience set them apart from a world that faced judgment. Early Christians understood this as a foreshadowing of how God uses baptism to bring people into salvation.The Exodus story reinforces this theme. When the Israelites passed through the Red Sea, Scripture describes this moment as a “baptism into Moses” (1 Corinthians 10:1–2). The waters marked the end of slavery and the beginning of a covenant life. Christian baptism fulfills this same pattern—deliverance from sin and entrance into a new spiritual identity.These biblical narratives reveal a consistent theological reality: God uses water to separate the old life from the new.Baptism and the Gift of New LifeIn Christian teaching, baptism is inseparable from spiritual transformation. When Peter preached at Pentecost, he declared that repentance and baptism lead to forgiveness and the reception of the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38). Baptism is not merely symbolic; it is the moment when God imparts new life and brings the believer into fellowship with His Spirit.Jesus Himself affirmed this truth:“Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God”(John 3:5).Thus, baptism serves as the gateway to spiritual rebirth. Without it, a person remains in the condition Paul describes as “dead in trespasses and sins” (Ephesians 2:1–2). Christian theology teaches that spiritual life is not moral improvement—it is a resurrection of the inner person through Christ.A Respectful Invitation to MuslimsMuslims understand the importance of purification, obedience, and submission to God. Christianity builds upon these themes but teaches that baptism is the divinely appointed means by which God cleanses, renews, and unites a person to Christ.This message is extended to Muslims not as an attack on Islam, but as an expression of Christian theological conviction:Baptism cleanses from sin.Baptism brings a believer into covenant life.Baptism unites a person with the death and resurrection of Christ (Romans 6:3–4).Baptism opens the door to the Holy Spirit.Baptism prepares the soul for the final judgment described in Revelation 20.Christians therefore regard baptism as essential, not optional.An Invitation to Explore FurtherThe call to repentance and baptism is a universal Christian invitation—extended to all peoples and all nations. It is rooted in the message of Christ, the witness of the apostles, and the consistent teaching of the early Church.For Muslim readers who are exploring Christian faith, this is an opportunity to understand why baptism holds such a profound place in Christian theology. It is not merely a ritual; it is a divine encounter, a spiritual rebirth, and a step into God’s redeeming grace.",

    "full_content": "The Question of Jibril’s Identity in Muhammad’s Revelation: A Critical ExaminationBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionIn Islamic tradition, the angel Jibril (Gabriel) is presented as the messenger who delivered the Qur’an to Muhammad. However, a close reading of both the Qur’an and the Hadith raises serious questions about the identity of this figure. Unlike the biblical Gabriel, who consistently introduced himself by name and declared his divine commission (cf. Luke 1:19; Daniel 8:16), the Qur’anic Jibril never once introduces himself directly to Muhammad with the explicit words:“I am Jibril; I have been sent to you by Allah.”This absence of self-identification stands in stark contrast to the biblical record and undermines the reliability of Muhammad’s claim to prophethood. If Muslims insist that Jesus’ divinity cannot be accepted because he never said verbatim,“I am God, worship me,”then by the same logic, Muhammad’s encounter with the alleged Jibril must also be rejected, since no such explicit self-introduction exists.The Qur’anic Silence on Jibril’s Self-IntroductionA survey of the Qur’an reveals that the nameJibril(orGabriel) appears only in a handful of verses (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:97–98; Surah At-Tahrim 66:4). Yet in none of these does Jibril ever address Muhammad directly, nor does the Qur’an preserve any statement of Jibril introducing himself as God’s messenger.For example:Surah 2:97–98states:“Say, ‘Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel—it is he who has brought it (the Qur’an) down to your heart by permission of Allah…’”This verse speaksaboutJibril but notfromJibril. There is no direct speech where Jibril identifies himself.Surah 66:4mentions Jibril alongside other angelic beings but again, no self-identification is made.The Qur’an itself provides no evidence that Muhammad ever heard the words:“I am Jibril, I have been sent by Allah.”The First Encounter: Squeezing Without IntroductionIslamic tradition (Sahih al-Bukhari, Book 1, Hadith 3) records Muhammad’s first alleged encounter with Jibril in the cave of Hira. Muhammad reports that a being appeared and commanded him to “Read!” (Iqra). When Muhammad replied that he could not, the being violently squeezed him three times before dictating words later included in Surah 96:1–5.Crucially:No introduction is recorded.The being did not say who he was.The encounter was traumatic, not reassuring.Muhammad feared for his life and doubted his own sanity afterward.It was Muhammad’s later assumption—through others—that the figure was Jibril.By contrast, in the Bible, Gabriel always introduces himself:To Daniel:“Gabriel, make this man understand the vision.”(Daniel 8:16).To Zechariah:“I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God, and I was sent to speak to you.”(Luke 1:19).To Mary:“The angel said to her, ‘I am Gabriel…’”(Luke 1:26–27).The biblical Gabriel acts with clarity, reassurance, and divine authority. The Qur’anic figure, however, acted with violence and anonymity.The Satanic Verses and the Question of AuthenticityThe so-calledSatanic Versesepisode, preserved in early Islamic sources (al-Tabari,History of the Prophets and Kings, Vol. 6), recounts how Muhammad once delivered verses endorsing pagan goddesses (al-Lat, al-‘Uzza, and Manat) as intercessors. Later, he retracted them, claiming Satan had deceived him.If Muhammad could be deceived by Satan once, then the legitimacy of his entire encounter with the unnamed “angel” in the cave is suspect. Since this being never identified himself, what guarantee exists that it was not a demonic entity rather than the biblical Gabriel?Applying the Muslim Argument ConsistentlyMuslims frequently reject Jesus’ divinity with the argument:“He never said, ‘I am God, worship me.’”If such a standard of verbatim self-claim is applied to Muhammad, then:Muhammad never heard Jibril say:“I am Jibril, sent by Allah.”The Qur’an never records such a declaration.The Hadith never preserves such a statement.Thus, by their own standard, Muslims must concede that Muhammad never met Jibril.ConclusionThe Qur’an and Hadith fail to provide any explicit evidence that Muhammad ever encountered the angel Jibril. Unlike the biblical Gabriel, who always declared his identity and mission, the Qur’anic “Jibril” remains silent, anonymous, and forceful in his first appearance. This absence of self-identification raises deep suspicions about the true nature of the being Muhammad encountered.If Jesus’ divine nature can be dismissed on the grounds of not making a verbatim claim, then Muhammad’s encounter with Jibril must also be rejected on the same grounds. Without Jibril’s clear testimony, Muhammad’s prophethood rests on uncertain and highly questionable foundations.ReferencesThe Qur’an: Surah Al-Baqarah 2:97–98; Surah At-Tahrim 66:4; Surah Al-‘Alaq 96:1–5.Sahih al-Bukhari, Book 1, Hadith 3.Al-Tabari,History of the Prophets and Kings, Vol. 6.Guillaume, A.

    "full_content": "Pork in the Qur’an: A Theological and Textual ExaminationBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThe dietary laws in Islam have long been debated among scholars, with the prohibition of pork standing at the center of controversy. Muslims today universally regard pork as haram (forbidden), yet the Qur’an itself presents a complex testimony that raises questions regarding this absolute prohibition. A closer reading of the Qur’an demonstrates that (1) pork is referred to as a“good thing”, (2) its prohibition is historically tied to the Jews as a punishment, not as a universal law, and (3) Jesus, according to the Qur’an, came to permit such foods. These facts expose significant theological tensions within Islamic doctrine.The Qur’an on the Prohibition of Good Things (Surah An-Nisa 4:160)Surah An-Nisa 4:160 states:“So for the wrongdoing of the Jews, We prohibited for them good things that had been lawful to them, and for their averting from the way of Allah many people.”This verse makes several important theological assertions:The prohibition was directed specifically to the Jews, not to all humanity.The things prohibited were described as“good things.”This suggests that foods such as pork are inherently good and beneficial, but were denied to the Jews as divine punishment.The Qur’an never explicitly extends this punishment to Muslims.Thus, the Qur’an itself implicitly acknowledges that pork is agood thing, contradicting later Islamic jurisprudence that categorically bans it.Jesus in the Qur’an Permitting the Forbidden (Surah Al-Imran 3:50)The Qur’an places Jesus in direct contrast to the Torah’s restrictions:“And [I have come] confirming what was before me of the Torah and to make lawful for you some of what was forbidden to you. And I have come to you with a sign from your Lord, so fear Allah and obey me.”(Al-Imran 3:50)From this, several conclusions emerge:Jesus explicitly permits what had been previously forbidden.Since pork was among the forbidden foods in the Torah, the Qur’an acknowledges that Jesus came to remove such restrictions.Jesus commands obedience:“Obey me.”According to the Qur’an’s own testimony, obedience to Jesus includes recognition of his authority to allow foods such as pork.Therefore, to reject the eating of pork while acknowledging Jesus as a prophet in the Qur’an places Muslims in a theological contradiction.The Food of the People of the Book (Surah Al-Ma’idah 5:5)Further clarity is found in Surah Al-Ma’idah:“This day [all] good foods have been made lawful, and the food of those who were given the Scripture is lawful for you, and your food is lawful for them.”(Al-Ma’idah 5:5)This verse is unambiguous:Allgood foodsare made lawful.The food of the People of the Book (Christians and Jews) is permitted for Muslims.Since Christians eat pork and the Qur’an recognizes their food as lawful, pork is thereby permissible within the Qur’an’s framework.This raises the question: If God declared the food of Christians as lawful, how can pork simultaneously be haram?Theological Contradictions for IslamThe evidence above reveals multiple theological problems for Islam:Historical Limitation of Prohibition: Pork was prohibited to the Jews alone (4:160), not universally.Jesus’ Authority to Permit: The Qur’an affirms that Jesus came to lift dietary restrictions (3:50).Permission of Christian Food: The Qur’an sanctions Christian dietary practices (5:5), which include pork.Taken together, these passages undermine the absolute prohibition of pork in Islam and expose inconsistency in Islamic jurisprudence.ConclusionThe Qur’an itself affirms that pork is agood thing, restricted only as a punishment upon the Jews. Jesus, according to the Qur’an, came to make lawful what had been forbidden, which includes pork. Moreover, the Qur’an permits Muslims to eat the food of Christians, which includes pork consumption.Therefore, the Muslim prohibition of pork is not grounded in the Qur’an, but rather in later Islamic tradition and jurisprudence. This presents a theological calamity for Islam, as it demonstrates inconsistency between Qur’anic testimony and Islamic practice.The central question remains:If Allah called pork a good thing, Jesus permitted it, and the Qur’an allows Christians’ food, why do Muslims continue to forbid what their scripture permits?ReferencesThe Qur’an, Surah An-Nisa 4:160The Qur’an, Surah Al-Imran 3:50The Qur’an, Surah Al-Ma’idah 5:5Guillaume, A.

This paper argues that Muhammad was neither Sunni nor Shia, and that all sectarian divisions in Islam represent a deviation from his original message. Drawing upon the Prophet’s own words in the Hadith concerning the seventy-three sects, it becomes evident that Muhammad condemned the fragmentation of his followers into groups and declared all but one sect as destined for Hellfire. The study challenges contemporary Muslims to re-examine their allegiance to sectarian doctrines and to consider the implications of following systems Muhammad never endorsed.1. IntroductionThe sectarian split in Islam—principally betweenSunniandShia—has shaped the political, theological, and social realities of the Muslim world for over a millennium. However, a fundamental question arises:Was Muhammad himself affiliated with any sect?Historically, the answer is unambiguous. NeitherSunni IslamnorShia Islamexisted during Muhammad’s lifetime. These divisions crystallized in the decades and centuries following his death, largely due to disputes over leadership, interpretation of revelation, and jurisprudence.Hence, to describe Muhammad as either Sunni or Shia is anachronistic—projecting later developments backward onto the Prophet himself.2. The Hadith of the Seventy-Three SectsA pivotal text often cited in discussions of Islamic sectarianism is the hadith recorded inSunan Abu Dawud(Hadith 4596) andSunan al-Tirmidhi(Hadith 2641):“The Jews were divided into seventy-one sects, the Christians into seventy-two, and my Ummah will divide into seventy-three sects. All of them are in the Fire except one.”When asked which one, the Prophet replied:“That which I and my Companions are upon.”This narration—though varied in form and authenticity—has been used by Muslims themselves to justify sectarian exclusivity. Yet, ironically, it is acondemnationof sectarianism, not a justification for it. The Prophet’s statement is a prophetic warning, not a license to create divisions.3. The Prophet’s Sect: The Qur’an AloneIf Muhammad declared that salvation belongs only to those who follow “what I and my companions follow,” then it becomes critical to ask:What did Muhammad and his companions follow?They followedthe Qur’an alone, for there was no codified “Hadith literature,” no “madhhab,” and certainly no “Sunni” or “Shia” theology. Muhammad’s followers obeyed his message as revealed in the Qur’an, not through later compilations or sectarian interpretations.The Qur’an itself warns repeatedly against division:“As for those who divided their religion and became sects, you (O Muhammad) have nothing to do with them; their affair is with Allah alone.”—Surah Al-An‘am 6:159This verse alone discredits any notion that Muhammad would have approved of sectarian identity. It directly refutes those who classify themselves as Sunni, Shia, or any other denomination.4. The Contradiction of Modern IslamModern Muslims claim to follow the Prophet, yet most identify themselves with one of overseventy sects—Sunni, Shia, Sufi, Ahmadiyya, Ibadi, Wahhabi, or Qur’aniyoon, among others. Even within Sunni Islam, there are subdivisions—Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi‘i, Hanbali—each differing in legal rulings and theological emphasis.If Muhammad declared that every sect apart from his own and that of his companions would end in Hellfire, then according to his own words, all these sects—including Sunni and Shia—fall outside the “saved group.” The so-called “Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jama‘ah” (People of the Sunnah and the Community) cannot claim to represent Muhammad’s path while simultaneously adhering to post-Prophetic doctrines.5. The Role of Hadith in Creating SectsAnother layer of complexity lies in theHadith literatureitself. The collections known today (Sahih Bukhari, Sahih Muslim, etc.) were compiled more than two centuries after Muhammad’s death. They represent human efforts to preserve oral traditions—but also to define orthodoxy and authority.Many of these Hadiths became the foundation of sectarian law and theology. Thus, the very act of combining the Qur’an with Hadith as equal sources of faith contradicts the Prophet’s own era, whereonly revelation (the Qur’an)was recited, memorized, and codified under divine inspiration.If Muhammad’s followers in his lifetime had only the Qur’an as their divine reference, then those who add extra-Qur’anic sources effectively belong to a different religious formulation—a sect not identical to that of Muhammad and his companions.6. A Theological ChallengeTherefore, the challenge to contemporary Muslims is straightforward yet profound:Was Muhammad a Sunni or a Shia?Did he follow Hadith literature that was written centuries later?If he was neither Sunni nor Shia, then why do his followers claim these labels?And if, as the Hadith says, all sects except his own will enter Hell, what assurance do these sectarian followers have of salvation?The uncomfortable truth is that modern Islam—fragmented, violent, and contradictory—is far removed from the simple monotheism and unity Muhammad claimed to represent.7. Ethical and Spiritual ImplicationsBeyond theology, the implications are moral. The very divisions condemned by the Prophet have produced centuries of bloodshed, persecution, and theological arrogance. Muslims have killed one another over doctrinal nuances, each side claiming to be “the saved sect.” Yet the Prophet warned of this very outcome.The Qur’an itself declares:“And hold fast, all of you together, to the rope of Allah, and be not divided.”—Surah Aal-Imran 3:103The “rope of Allah” is the Qur’an—not the traditions, councils, or sectarian creeds of later generations.8. ConclusionThe Prophet Muhammad was neither Sunni nor Shia. He belonged to no sect, no theological school, and no jurisprudential faction. He was, according to the Qur’an, simply“a Muslim”(Surah Al-Ahzab 33:35).Those who claim his legacy while embracing sectarian labels reject his own warning about division. By Muhammad’s own testimony, only the sect that remains faithful to his example and that of his companions—the Qur’an alone—will escape the fate of Hellfire.Hence, the overwhelming majority of Muslims today, whether Sunni or Shia, by their own Prophet’s standard, stand condemned by the very traditions they claim to defend.ReferencesSunan Abu Dawud, Hadith 4596.Sunan al-Tirmidhi, Hadith 2641.Surah Al-An‘am 6:159– The Qur’an.Surah Aal-Imran 3:103– The Qur’an.Al-Baghdadi, Abu Mansur.Al-Farq Bayna al-Firaq.Ibn Hazm,Al-Fisal fi al-Milal wa al-Ahwa’ wa al-Nihal.Dar al-Ifta Al-Misriyyah,Is it true that only one sect of the Ummah will enter Paradise?Watt, W.

This is a minority position in Islamic history, not one of the traditional major madhahib (schools).Examination of the Claimed Hadiths & Their InterpretationsThe hadith about “73 sects”There is a widely circulated hadith (or reports) stating something along these lines:“My Ummah will be divided into seventy-three sects; all but one will be in Hell, and the saved sect is the one that follows what I and my companions follow.”Scholars have collected many versions; some with additions like “all of them will be in Hell except one”, others without that addition; some where the saved group is described simply asal-Jamaʿah, or “the group”, or “those who follow me and my companions”. (Islam-QA)Authenticity / CriticismScholars have debated:Which versions are authentic or weak. Some versions include extra phrases (“all except one in Hell”, etc.) that some scholars regard as weak or even fabricated. (موقع  دار الإفتاء المصرية)Whether all narrations attributed to this hadith are sahih (sound), hasan (good), or weak. Some affirm parts are acceptable, others reject certain additions. (islam3.worldofislam.info)Analysis of the Specific ClaimsYou asserted several things. Let’s check them one by one.AssertionEvidence / Counter-Arguments“Muhammad declares Sunni, Shia and all Muslims following different sects are in Hellfire.”The hadith discussed doessaythat the Ummah will split into many sects and all but one will be in Hellfire (in some versions). But: • The versions differ; some donotinclude the phrase “all but one in Hellfire” verbatim; sometimes it is weaker. (موقع  دار الإفتاء المصرية) • Furthermore, identifying contemporary “Sunni”, “Shia” etc., with those sects is a retrospective interpretation. The hadith doesnotexplicitly mention “Sunni” or “Shia” in most versions in the way they are used today. • Some scholars caution against using such hadiths to judge individuals or groups with certainty, because of issues of authenticity, context, meaning.“Muhammad was not a Sunni / Shia (because those sects came later).”This is largely correct from a historical perspective: the formal Sunni / Shia labels, schools, theological systems, crystallized after the Prophet’s death, often in the 2nd / 3rd Islamic centuries. So Muhammad himself cannot be properly said to have “belonged” to a sect named “Sunni” or “Shia” as they are used today.“Muhammad did not combine Hadith with Qur’an; if you do, you differ from him (i.e. you are of a sect).”There is no credible evidence that Muhammad himself rejected Hadith; in fact, Muslims believe many sayings/actions of Muhammad are preserved as Hadith. The hadith literature is considered by most Muslims as explanatory of the Qur’an, and Muhammad is understood to have instituted practices and words beyond the Qur’an (as Muslims believe). The Qur’an itself refers to obeying the Prophet and following his example (as Muslims interpret). So the idea that Muhammad followed “Qur’an only” in the sense of rejecting or not needing Hadith is not supported by mainstream Islamic sources.“If you follow Qur’an only but belong to Sunni or Shia sect, you are not of Muhammad’s sect, all are going to hell according to Muhammad.”This is an interpretation that some people derive from certain versions of the 73 sects hadith. But scholars debate whether those versions are reliable. Also, mainstream scholarship holds that salvation is not strictly about sect labels but about faith, actions, sincerity, etc. The Qur’an repeatedly emphasizes righteous belief and deeds. So to say definitively that all but one sect are going to hell is controversial and not accepted universally.Scholarly PositionsManySunnischolars interpret that the “saved sect” (the one among the many divisions) isal-Jamaʿah(“the group / community”), defined as those who adhere to what Muhammad and his companions did. This is seen in works such asAl-Farq Bayna al-Firaqby Abu Mansur al-Baghdadi. (Wikipedia)Some scholars accept the hadith about 73 sects in a form that doesnotinclude “all in Hell except one”, or only in a weaker form. They caution against using it to judge other Muslims. (موقع  دار الإفتاء المصرية)Scholars differ on whether certain narrations are “mutawatir” (strongly transmitted) versus “ahad” (individual) and how much weight to give to them. Some additions (e.g. “all in Hell except one”) are considered less certain. (موقع  دار الإفتاء المصرية)ConclusionFrom a scholarly standpoint:Muhammad was neither Sunni nor Shia in the sense those terms later came to define. Those sects formed after his passing.The hadith about the 73 sects is real in Islamic tradition in many versions; it is reported that there will be many sects and that one is the “saved group” (often defined as the Jamaʿah, or those following Muhammad and his companions).However, not all versions of the hadith are universally accepted. There is debate over authenticity, over the exact wording, over whether it literally means “all other sects are in hell” in the sense some interpret it.Mainstream Islamic theology holds that faith, deeds, sincerity, following the guidance of Qur’an + authentic Sunnah (Prophetic tradition) matter; sectarian labels are less emphasized in terms of ultimate judgment.Suggested Bibliography & References(As would be appropriate in a theological institute)Al-Baghdadi, Abu Mansur -Al-Farq Bayna al-Firaq.Ibn Hazm,Al-Fisal fi al-Milal wa al-Ahwa’ wa al-Nihal.Ibn al-Wazir,Al-Awasim wa al-Qawasim fi Dhabb an-Sunnah Abi l-Qasim.Shawkani,Fath al-Qadir.Tirmidhi, Sunan al-Tirmidhi (Hadith 2641) — narration of Ibn ‘Amr.Dar al-Ifta / Fatwa bodies that discuss the hadith of “73 sects” (e.g. Egypt’s Dar al-Ifta).

    "full_content": "MUHAMMAD WAS UNAWARE OF RELIGIONBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis article explores the controversial claim within Islamic exegesis that Prophet Muhammad (s.a.w.w.) was initially unaware of religion and divine guidance prior to his prophetic commission. Drawing from authoritative Islamic sources, includingAysar al-Tafasirby Abu Bakr al-Jaza’iri, this paper examines the theological implications of such assertions in contrast to the Qur’an’s self-portrayal of the Prophet’s mission. Furthermore, it critically evaluates how these statements challenge the notion of Muhammad’s infallibility (‘ismah) and his pre-prophetic spiritual awareness.1. IntroductionWithin Islamic theology, Prophet Muhammad is often presented as the “Seal of the Prophets” (Khatam an-Nabiyyin)—a figure endowed with divine revelation and impeccable character. However, certain classical Islamic commentaries suggest that prior to receiving revelation, Muhammad did not possess knowledge of divine law or the true religion. This notion raises significant theological questions: Was Muhammad divinely prepared from birth, or was his awareness of true faith only realized upon the first revelation (wahy)?A striking example of this view appears inAysar al-Tafasirby Abu Bakr al-Jaza’iri, a respected Sunni scholar, who asserts that Muhammad “did not know the religion or the correct guidance” (lam yakun ya‘lamu ad-dīn wa-l-hudā). This statement, found in Volume 5, page 2070, provokes critical examination concerning the Prophet’s pre-prophetic state of knowledge.2. Textual Analysis of the SourceInAysar al-Tafasir, Abu Bakr al-Jaza’iri writes:“The noble Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) did not know religion or the correct guidance [before revelation].”—Aysar al-Tafasir, Vol. 5, p. 2070.This statement refers to Qur’an 42:52:“And thus We have revealed to you a Spirit of Our command. You did not know what the Book was, nor what faith was, but We have made it a light by which We guide whom We will of Our servants.” (Surah Ash-Shura 42:52)Abu Bakr al-Jaza’iri interprets this verse literally, implying that the Prophet’s understanding of religion and divine law was entirely absent before the descent of revelation.From a theological standpoint, this interpretation creates tension with the Qur’an’s broader portrayal of Muhammad as one chosen and prepared by God from birth, as seen in verses such asSurah al-Inshirah (94:1–3)—“Did We not expand your breast for you and remove from you your burden?”—which may suggest divine preparation prior to revelation.3. Theological ImplicationsIf the Prophet Muhammad was indeed unaware of religion prior to the revelation, as Abu Bakr al-Jaza’iri suggests, several critical implications arise:Questioning Pre-Prophetic Infallibility:Islamic scholars who uphold‘ismah(prophetic infallibility) argue that prophets are divinely protected from sin and error even before their mission. However, the claim that Muhammad did not know divine guidance seems to challenge this doctrine.Conflict with Divine Foreknowledge and Selection:The Qur’an depicts Muhammad as divinely chosen: “Allah chooses messengers from angels and from men” (Surah al-Hajj 22:75). If Muhammad lacked any prior awareness of truth, this raises the question of divine foreknowledge—how can one be the “best of creation” while entirely unaware of divine reality before revelation?Comparative Prophetic Knowledge:Unlike other prophets such as Moses or Jesus, who demonstrated spiritual awareness from an early age (cf. Exodus 3:1–6; Luke 2:46–49), Muhammad’s pre-revelation period appears, in Islamic sources, as one of ignorance (jahiliyyah). This distinction is critical in understanding the uniqueness and development of Muhammad’s prophetic consciousness.4. Scholarly ReflectionsIslamic and non-Islamic scholars have long debated Muhammad’s pre-prophetic spiritual condition:Al-Razi (Fakhr al-Din):Interprets 42:52 symbolically, arguing that “not knowing faith” refers not to ignorance of God but to the absence of prophetic revelation.Ibn Kathir:Suggests that the Prophet was familiar with certain truths of Abrahamic monotheism but did not yet possess formalized law (Shari‘ah).Western Islamicistssuch as W. Montgomery Watt and Alfred Guillaume have described this state as “ethical monotheism without revelation,” where Muhammad sensed divine presence but lacked structured doctrine.From a Christian theological perspective, this scenario underscores the human dimension of Muhammad’s prophetic identity, distinguishing it from the divine pre-existence of Christ (John 1:1–14). Unlike Jesus, whose divine knowledge preceded His incarnation, Muhammad’s awareness of God appears contingent and developmental.5. ConclusionThe statement that Prophet Muhammad “did not know religion or correct guidance” prior to revelation, as asserted by Abu Bakr al-Jaza’iri, presents a significant theological paradox within Islam. It challenges the doctrine of prophetic infallibility and the concept of divine foreordination. While Qur’anic verses such as 42:52 provide textual support for this claim, the broader Islamic theological framework attempts to reconcile Muhammad’s human unawareness with divine election and ultimate perfection.From a comparative theological perspective, this distinction underscores a central difference between Islamic and Christian understandings of divine revelation and prophetic knowledge—whereas Muhammad attains divine understanding through progressive revelation, Christ embodies divine knowledge inherently.ReferencesAbu Bakr al-Jaza’iri.Aysar al-Tafasir li Kalam al-‘Ali al-Kabir.

    "full_content": "Jesus and the Kaaba: A Critical Examination of Muhammad’s ClaimBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteIntroductionIslamic tradition contains various narrations (ahadith) in which the Prophet Muhammad claimed to have seen or interacted with biblical figures, including Jesus. Among these is a peculiar report inSahih al-Bukhariwhere Muhammad asserted that he saw Jesus performingṭawāf(circumambulation) around the Kaaba in Mecca. This claim raises significant historical, theological, and logical concerns. Not only does this narration contradict the biblical record of Jesus’ ministry, but it also suggests a profound inconsistency in Muhammad’s prophetic claims, calling into question the authenticity of his revelations.The Hadith in QuestionSahih al-Bukhari, Book 55, Hadith 649 records:Narrated Ibn Umar:The Prophet said,“I saw Jesus, Moses, and Abraham. Jesus was of red complexion, curly-haired and broad-chested. Moses was of brown complexion, straight-haired and tall, as if he was from the people of Az-Zutt. Abraham was of similar appearance to your companion (i.e., Muhammad).”In another narration, Muhammad claimed that he saw Jesus performing circumambulation of the Kaaba along with other prophets.(Reference:Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 4, Book 55, Hadith 649; Sahih Muslim, Book 30, Hadith 5834).Historical and Theological Inconsistencies1.Jesus Never Traveled to ArabiaThe New Testament is clear that the ministry of Jesus Christ was limited to Israel and its surrounding regions (Matthew 15:24; Luke 4:43). Nowhere is there evidence—biblical, historical, or archaeological—that Jesus ever set foot in Arabia, much less Mecca.2.Idolatry and the Black StoneJesus consistently condemned idolatry and pagan practices (Matthew 4:10; John 4:21–24). The Kaaba’s rituals, including the kissing of the Black Stone, were rooted in pre-Islamic paganism. To place Jesus in this environment, performing acts of worship associated with idolatry, is an affront to His divine mission and biblical teaching.3.Contradiction with the Biblical Image of ChristJesus is portrayed in Scripture as thesinless Son of Godwho came to fulfill the Law and reveal the Father (John 14:9). Associating Him with a pagan shrine undermines His divine authority and purity.Contradictions with the Qur’an ItselfEven within Islamic scripture, Muhammad’s hadith about Jesus in Mecca creates contradictions:Qur’an 3:45–46— Jesus is announced asal-Masīḥ, the Messiah, who will speak from the cradle and in maturity. The Qur’an situates His mission entirely in Israel, not Arabia.Qur’an 19:30–33— Jesus declares,“Indeed, I am the servant of Allah. He has given me the Scripture and made me a prophet. And He has made me blessed wherever I am.”This blessing was tied to His mission in Israel, not a pilgrimage to Mecca.Qur’an 5:110— Allah recounts to Jesus His miracles amongthe Children of Israel. No mention of Mecca.Qur’an 43:59— Jesus is said to be “an example to the Children of Israel,” not Arabs.Thus, Muhammad’s hadith about Jesus at the Kaaba not only contradicts the Bible but alsoclashes with the Qur’an’s own testimonyabout Jesus’ identity, mission, and historical setting.Islamic Scholarly Commentary on the HadithMuslim exegetes themselves struggled to reconcile these narrations:Ibn Kathir(inTafsir al-Qur’an al-‘Azim) acknowledged the hadith but treated it as avisionary experiencerather than a literal historical event. He suggested that Muhammad may have been shown symbolic images in a dream. However, this explanation contradicts the way Bukhari presents the hadith as a direct prophetic vision.Al-Tabari(inTarikh al-Rusul wa’l-Muluk) recorded similar reports but left them largely uninterpreted, reflecting the difficulty of reconciling them with known history. His silence indicates the discomfort Islamic historians felt when confronted with these claims.Al-Nawawi(in his commentary on Sahih Muslim) interpreted Muhammad’s vision of Jesus at the Kaaba asmetaphorical, meaning that the prophets were shown as “spiritually affirming” the Kaaba, not physically performing rituals there. Yet this forced allegorical reading departs from the plain wording of the hadith.The fact that Muslim scholars could not agree — and often resorted to metaphor, dream imagery, or silence — shows that the hadith was problematic even for Islam’s own tradition.Theological Implication: A False ProphecyIf Muhammad claimed to have seen Jesus at the Kaaba, this is a false prophecy because it misrepresents the historical Jesus. The Bible warns against false prophets who proclaim lies in the name of God (Deuteronomy 18:20–22; Matthew 24:24). By fabricating such visions, Muhammad undermines his own credibility as a prophet.Allah’s Silence and Theological ConsequencesIf Allah were the true God, he would not allow his supposed prophet to propagate falsehoods about revered figures such as Jesus. Instead, the Qur’an permits and even supports these contradictions. This suggests that Allah of the Qur’an is not the God of the Bible but a different entity altogether—one that failed to preserve divine truth.ConclusionThe hadith claiming that Jesus ran around the Kaaba is historically implausible, theologically offensive, and prophetically false. It contradicts both thebiblical recordand theQur’an’s own testimonyabout Jesus. Furthermore, the discomfort of Muslim exegetes like Ibn Kathir, Al-Tabari, and Al-Nawawi shows that even within Islam this narration was seen as problematic. Rather than affirming divine revelation, such hadith distort the mission of Christ and expose the inconsistencies within Islamic tradition.The God of the Bible does not confuse or contradict Himself (Numbers 23:19; 1 Corinthians 14:33). This evidence strongly supports the conclusion that Muhammad was not a true prophet, but a man speaking visions from his own imagination.ReferencesThe Holy Bible(KJV, ESV, NIV).Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 4, Book 55, Hadith 649.Sahih Muslim, Book 30, Hadith 5834.The Qur’an: 3:45–46; 19:30–33; 5:110; 43:59.Ibn Kathir,Tafsir al-Qur’an al-‘Azim.Al-Tabari,Tarikh al-Rusul wa’l-Muluk.Al-Nawawi,Sharh Sahih Muslim.Deuteronomy 18:20–22; Matthew 4:10; John 14:9; 1 Corinthians 14:33.Cragg, Kenneth.The Event of the Qur’an: Islam in Its Scripture.St. Clair-Tisdall, W.Sources of the Qur’an: Original Materials and the Origins of Islam.✍️ Written byDr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba — Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractA tradition recorded in the major hadith collections describes a vision in which a man identified as “al-Masīḥ (the Messiah), son of Mary” is seen circumambulating the Kaʿbah. That narration has been used within Islamic eschatological literature to support the claim that Jesus will physically return and perform rites associated with Islam. This article examines the textual record, places the narration against the historical record for the life of Jesus, surveys classical and modern Muslim interpretations, and argues that the hadith — read literally and used as proof that Jesus once visited Mecca or that Muhammad reliably reported a real historical visitation — is untenable. The narration is better understood as a dream-vision or eschatological symbol, not as documentary evidence that the historical Jesus ever travelled to the Arabian Peninsula. If the narration is pressed into literal historicity, it raises serious questions about the reliability of the prophetic report and the theological claims built upon it.1. The Text (original hadith fragment and source)A well-attested narration appears in the canonical collections (Sahih Muslim; versions of Sahih al-Bukhari also contain related material). A representative English rendering (paraphrased) reads:“I saw a man, his hair falling on his shoulders and water dripping from his head; he was placing his hands on the shoulders of two men while circumambulating the Kaʿbah. When I asked, ‘Who is he?’ I was told, ‘Al-Masīḥ, son of Mary.’” (Sahih Muslim — narration of a dream/vision). (Sunnah)Note:the wording above is a concise rendering of the hadith narrative; full English translations and the Arabic text are available in the cited hadith collections. (Sunnah)2. Genre and Context: Dreams, Visions, and Eschatology in the Hadith CorpusTwo important contextual facts must be set out before drawing historical conclusions from the narration:The report is presented as a dream/vision.Multiple chains present the episode as something seen in a dream or as part of a prophetic vision; the language of “I saw in my sleep / in a dream” recurs in the narrations. Dreams and symbolic visions occupy a recognized place in prophetic literature and classical Muslim hermeneutics—many early exegetes treat such reports as eschatological imagery rather than straightforward, empirical reportage. (Sunnah)The wider eschatological corpus frames the event.The narration appears in passages that discuss the end-times (the return of ʿĪsā, the coming of al-Dajjāl, the Mahdī, the dismantling of the Kaʿbah, and related signs). Eschatological literature in Islam is highly symbolic and interpolated over centuries; commentators (classical and modern) offer a range of readings — literal, symbolic, local, and universal. See surveys in contemporary scholarship on Islamic eschatology. (Tilburg University Research Portal)3. Historical Evidence on Jesus’ Life and Travel — The Weight of the SourcesThe canonical gospels — the primary historical sources used in mainstream historical Jesus scholarship — consistently locate Jesus’s public ministry in Galilee, Judea and parts of the immediate Levant. There is no independently attested evidence in the earliest Christian texts that Jesus ever travelled to the Hijaz (the region containing Mecca and the Kaʿbah). Major scholarly overviews of the historical Jesus (and standard readings of the Gospels) place his activity in Capernaum, Nazareth, Jerusalem and surrounding regions. (Bible Gateway)Archaeological and epigraphic evidence does attest to Christian presence in parts of Arabia by late antiquity, but that is centuries after the life of Jesus and does not supply evidence that the historical Jesus ever visited Mecca. Recent finds show early Christian inscriptions in Arabia, yet these document later Christian communities — not first-century travels by Jesus himself. (Biblical Archaeology Society)Conclusion from historical evidence:there is no credible independent historical basis (from Christian or secular records) to assert that the historical Jesus visited Mecca or ever “kissed the Black Stone.” The hadith portrayal, taken as a claim about first-century events, conflicts with the better attested portrait of Jesus’s geographical activity. (Bible Gateway)4. Interpretive Options within Islamic Tradition (summary)Scholars and traditions within Islam have approached these hadiths in a few different ways:Literal eschatological reading:Some traditional commentators accept a literal reading — that Jesus will return in the last days, will appear in Arabia, and may perform tawāf or speak near the Kaʿbah (or be seen in visions there) as part of the end-time events. This is a common reading among many Sunni commentators. (Sunnah)Visionary/metaphorical reading:Other interpreters (and movements inside Islam, e.g., some reformist or Ahmadiyya commentaries) read the narration as symbolic: the “circling” may represent spiritual influence or the struggle between truth and falsehood centered symbolically on the Kaʿbah. In such readings the hadith is not evidence that a first-century Jesus physically travelled to Mecca. (ahmadianswers.com)Late interpolation and eschatological development:Modern academic work on hadith formation and apocalyptic literature shows that eschatological motifs were subject to significant development and editing over time; hence late eschatological reports must be evaluated against textual history and genre. (MDPI)5. Problems with a Literal, Historical Reading — Critical ObjectionsGenre mismatch:the report’s dreaming/vision framing undermines its use as straightforward historical testimony. Dreams are inherently subjective and symbolic; treating them as literal historical records requires additional independent corroboration, which is absent here. (Sunnah)Lack of corroboration in contemporaneous sources:canonical Christian sources and near-contemporary historical records contain no trace of a journey by Jesus to the Hijaz. Mainstream historical Jesus scholarship emphasizes Galilean and Judean activity, not long journeys to the Arabian Peninsula. The burden of proof therefore lies on those asserting a literal first-century voyage to Mecca. (Bible Gateway)Eschatological later-stage development:the hadith participates in a corpus of apocalyptic literature that developed over generations. Apocalyptic texts often use symbolic action and inversion (e.g., good and evil both appearing near sacred centres) and should be read with methods suited to prophetic/eschatological genres. (Tilburg University Research Portal)Doctrinal consequences and epistemic risk:if a prophet’s report is read literally and leads to a claim that contradicts historical evidence, that raises the question of prophetic reliability. If one treats the hadith as a factual, eyewitness report of an event outside the prophet’s temporal range of knowledge (and it cannot be independently verified), then a serious epistemological tension arises for those who claim inerrant prophetic reportage. The tension is magnified if the report is used to assert historical facts about Jesus’s past movements. (This is the central critical point of this article.) (Hadith Collection)6. Scholarly Conclusion and Theological Implication (argument summary)The narration in Sahih Muslim and related streams is best read aseschatological vision-literaturerather than reliable historical testimony that Jesus physically went to Mecca in the first century. The genre, chain of transmission framing, and lack of extraneous corroboration all support a non-literal reading.If, however, the narration is pressed into a literal historical claim about Jesus’s pre-existing movement in the first century, it contradicts stronger historical evidence (the Gospels and patristic/archaeological record) and thereby undermines the epistemic status of the report. For those who argue that prophetic claims must be held to high standards of veracity, this tension calls into question whether such a hadith can sustain the weight of historical or theological claims made in its name.Theologically, readers must choose: treat the hadith assymbolic/eschatological(which avoids a contradiction with the historical Jesus) or treat it asliteral and historical(which generates a stark historical conflict and raises issues about the report’s reliability). The more intellectually responsible posture for scholars committed to historical method is to take the symbolic/vision interpretation, or else to acknowledge the hadith’s limits as a source for reconstructing first-century events.

(Biblical Archaeology Society)Final Note (authorial stance)This paper takes a critical, evidentiary approach: it does not aim to denigrate sincere belief, but to subject specific textual claims to historical and hermeneutical scrutiny. When a prophetic report appears to conflict with a robust body of independent historical evidence, scholars have an obligation to distinguishvisionary/eschatological literaturefromhistorical reportage. In the absence of independent attestation that Jesus ever visited the Hijaz in the first century, the hadith in question cannot be used as reliable historical evidence that Jesus once ran around the Kaʿbah. Read in context and with genre awareness, the narration poses no necessary contradiction with the historical Jesus; read uncritically and literally for first-century events, it produces a problematic historical claim and a serious challenge to claims of infallible prophetic reportage.",

    "full_content": "Pork in the Qur’an: A Theological and Textual ExaminationBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThe dietary laws in Islam have long been debated among scholars, with the prohibition of pork standing at the center of controversy. Muslims today universally regard pork as haram (forbidden), yet the Qur’an itself presents a complex testimony that raises questions regarding this absolute prohibition. A closer reading of the Qur’an demonstrates that (1) pork is referred to as a“good thing”, (2) its prohibition is historically tied to the Jews as a punishment, not as a universal law, and (3) Jesus, according to the Qur’an, came to permit such foods. These facts expose significant theological tensions within Islamic doctrine.The Qur’an on the Prohibition of Good Things (Surah An-Nisa 4:160)Surah An-Nisa 4:160 states:“So for the wrongdoing of the Jews, We prohibited for them good things that had been lawful to them, and for their averting from the way of Allah many people.”This verse makes several important theological assertions:The prohibition was directed specifically to the Jews, not to all humanity.The things prohibited were described as“good things.”This suggests that foods such as pork are inherently good and beneficial, but were denied to the Jews as divine punishment.The Qur’an never explicitly extends this punishment to Muslims.Thus, the Qur’an itself implicitly acknowledges that pork is agood thing, contradicting later Islamic jurisprudence that categorically bans it.Jesus in the Qur’an Permitting the Forbidden (Surah Al-Imran 3:50)The Qur’an places Jesus in direct contrast to the Torah’s restrictions:“And [I have come] confirming what was before me of the Torah and to make lawful for you some of what was forbidden to you. And I have come to you with a sign from your Lord, so fear Allah and obey me.”(Al-Imran 3:50)From this, several conclusions emerge:Jesus explicitly permits what had been previously forbidden.Since pork was among the forbidden foods in the Torah, the Qur’an acknowledges that Jesus came to remove such restrictions.Jesus commands obedience:“Obey me.”According to the Qur’an’s own testimony, obedience to Jesus includes recognition of his authority to allow foods such as pork.Therefore, to reject the eating of pork while acknowledging Jesus as a prophet in the Qur’an places Muslims in a theological contradiction.The Food of the People of the Book (Surah Al-Ma’idah 5:5)Further clarity is found in Surah Al-Ma’idah:“This day [all] good foods have been made lawful, and the food of those who were given the Scripture is lawful for you, and your food is lawful for them.”(Al-Ma’idah 5:5)This verse is unambiguous:Allgood foodsare made lawful.The food of the People of the Book (Christians and Jews) is permitted for Muslims.Since Christians eat pork and the Qur’an recognizes their food as lawful, pork is thereby permissible within the Qur’an’s framework.This raises the question: If God declared the food of Christians as lawful, how can pork simultaneously be haram?Theological Contradictions for IslamThe evidence above reveals multiple theological problems for Islam:Historical Limitation of Prohibition: Pork was prohibited to the Jews alone (4:160), not universally.Jesus’ Authority to Permit: The Qur’an affirms that Jesus came to lift dietary restrictions (3:50).Permission of Christian Food: The Qur’an sanctions Christian dietary practices (5:5), which include pork.Taken together, these passages undermine the absolute prohibition of pork in Islam and expose inconsistency in Islamic jurisprudence.ConclusionThe Qur’an itself affirms that pork is agood thing, restricted only as a punishment upon the Jews. Jesus, according to the Qur’an, came to make lawful what had been forbidden, which includes pork. Moreover, the Qur’an permits Muslims to eat the food of Christians, which includes pork consumption.Therefore, the Muslim prohibition of pork is not grounded in the Qur’an, but rather in later Islamic tradition and jurisprudence. This presents a theological calamity for Islam, as it demonstrates inconsistency between Qur’anic testimony and Islamic practice.The central question remains:If Allah called pork a good thing, Jesus permitted it, and the Qur’an allows Christians’ food, why do Muslims continue to forbid what their scripture permits?ReferencesThe Qur’an, Surah An-Nisa 4:160The Qur’an, Surah Al-Imran 3:50The Qur’an, Surah Al-Ma’idah 5:5Guillaume, A.

However, a close reading of both the Qur’an and the Hadith raises serious questions about the identity of this figure. Unlike the biblical Gabriel, who consistently introduced himself by name and declared his divine commission (cf. Luke 1:19; Daniel 8:16), the Qur’anic Jibril never once introduces himself directly to Muhammad with the explicit words:“I am Jibril; I have been sent to you by Allah.”This absence of self-identification stands in stark contrast to the biblical record and undermines the reliability of Muhammad’s claim to prophethood. If Muslims insist that Jesus’ divinity cannot be accepted because he never said verbatim,“I am God, worship me,”then by the same logic, Muhammad’s encounter with the alleged Jibril must also be rejected, since no such explicit self-introduction exists.The Qur’anic Silence on Jibril’s Self-IntroductionA survey of the Qur’an reveals that the nameJibril(orGabriel) appears only in a handful of verses (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:97–98; Surah At-Tahrim 66:4). Yet in none of these does Jibril ever address Muhammad directly, nor does the Qur’an preserve any statement of Jibril introducing himself as God’s messenger.For example:Surah 2:97–98states:“Say, ‘Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel—it is he who has brought it (the Qur’an) down to your heart by permission of Allah…’”This verse speaksaboutJibril but notfromJibril. There is no direct speech where Jibril identifies himself.Surah 66:4mentions Jibril alongside other angelic beings but again, no self-identification is made.The Qur’an itself provides no evidence that Muhammad ever heard the words:“I am Jibril, I have been sent by Allah.”The First Encounter: Squeezing Without IntroductionIslamic tradition (Sahih al-Bukhari, Book 1, Hadith 3) records Muhammad’s first alleged encounter with Jibril in the cave of Hira. Muhammad reports that a being appeared and commanded him to “Read!” (Iqra). When Muhammad replied that he could not, the being violently squeezed him three times before dictating words later included in Surah 96:1–5.Crucially:No introduction is recorded.The being did not say who he was.The encounter was traumatic, not reassuring.Muhammad feared for his life and doubted his own sanity afterward.It was Muhammad’s later assumption—through others—that the figure was Jibril.By contrast, in the Bible, Gabriel always introduces himself:To Daniel:“Gabriel, make this man understand the vision.”(Daniel 8:16).To Zechariah:“I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God, and I was sent to speak to you.”(Luke 1:19).To Mary:“The angel said to her, ‘I am Gabriel…’”(Luke 1:26–27).The biblical Gabriel acts with clarity, reassurance, and divine authority. The Qur’anic figure, however, acted with violence and anonymity.The Satanic Verses and the Question of AuthenticityThe so-calledSatanic Versesepisode, preserved in early Islamic sources (al-Tabari,History of the Prophets and Kings, Vol. 6), recounts how Muhammad once delivered verses endorsing pagan goddesses (al-Lat, al-‘Uzza, and Manat) as intercessors. Later, he retracted them, claiming Satan had deceived him.If Muhammad could be deceived by Satan once, then the legitimacy of his entire encounter with the unnamed “angel” in the cave is suspect. Since this being never identified himself, what guarantee exists that it was not a demonic entity rather than the biblical Gabriel?Applying the Muslim Argument ConsistentlyMuslims frequently reject Jesus’ divinity with the argument:“He never said, ‘I am God, worship me.’”If such a standard of verbatim self-claim is applied to Muhammad, then:Muhammad never heard Jibril say:“I am Jibril, sent by Allah.”The Qur’an never records such a declaration.The Hadith never preserves such a statement.Thus, by their own standard, Muslims must concede that Muhammad never met Jibril.ConclusionThe Qur’an and Hadith fail to provide any explicit evidence that Muhammad ever encountered the angel Jibril. Unlike the biblical Gabriel, who always declared his identity and mission, the Qur’anic “Jibril” remains silent, anonymous, and forceful in his first appearance. This absence of self-identification raises deep suspicions about the true nature of the being Muhammad encountered.If Jesus’ divine nature can be dismissed on the grounds of not making a verbatim claim, then Muhammad’s encounter with Jibril must also be rejected on the same grounds. Without Jibril’s clear testimony, Muhammad’s prophethood rests on uncertain and highly questionable foundations.ReferencesThe Qur’an: Surah Al-Baqarah 2:97–98; Surah At-Tahrim 66:4; Surah Al-‘Alaq 96:1–5.Sahih al-Bukhari, Book 1, Hadith 3.Al-Tabari,History of the Prophets and Kings, Vol. 6.Guillaume, A.

    "full_content": "THE KISSING OF THE BLACK STONE IN ISLAM: A THEOLOGICAL AND HISTORICAL EXPOSITION OF PAGAN CONTINUITYBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis article evaluates the Islamic practice ofkissing, touching, or venerating the Black Stone (Hajar al-Aswad)located in the Kaaba. Through historical analysis, hadith literature, Qur’anic silence, and comparative studies of Near Eastern paganism, this study demonstrates that the Black Stone ritual isnot monotheistic, lacks divine sanction, and is an uninterrupted survival ofpre-Islamic Arabian paganism. By examining the prophetic statements attributed to Muhammad—particularly the hadith describing the Black Stone as a creature that will haveeyes, a tongue, and speak on the Day of Judgment—this article raises essential theological questions about the nature of worship, idolatry, and divine consistency.1. IntroductionAmong all Islamic rituals, none is more strikingly contradictory to monotheistic claims than thekissing of the Black Stoneduring the Hajj. Millions of Muslims annually struggle—sometimes violently—to touch, stroke, or kiss aphysical objectbelieved to possess spiritual power.Yet, neither theTorah, nor thePsalms, nor theGospel, nor any previous prophetic Scriptures ever command the veneration of stones. Rather, the Bible explicitly condemns such acts aspagan idolatry(Deut. 16:21; Lev. 26:1; 2 Kings 23:10).Islamic tradition, however, preserves rituals inherited directly fromArabian pagan worshipof sacred stones, trees, and idols. Even the Qur’an acknowledges that the Kaaba and its rites existedbefore Islam(Qur’an 8:35; 106:1–4), when pagans circled the Kaaba naked, blowing whistles and clapping as religious rites.Thus, the question arises:Why does Islam retain a central ritual rooted in the very pagan practices it claims to abolish?2. The Hadith Evidence: The Black Stone Will Have Eyes and a TongueThe following hadith—gradedhasan(good) by Imam al-Tirmidhi—states:Ibn Abbas narrated:“The Messenger of Allah said about the Black Stone:‘By Allah! Allah will raise it on the Day of Resurrection with two eyes by which it sees and a tongue that it speaks with, testifying to whoever touched it in truth.’”—Jami‘ at-Tirmidhi 961This narration raises profound theological contradictions:A stone will have eyes and a tongue.This contradicts Islamic claims that objects are not divine, conscious, or living.The stone will testify for or against worshippers.This attribute resemblespagan divine intermediaries, not monotheistic purity.Touching a physical object earns spiritual merit.This concept is fundamentally foreign to the monotheism claimed in Islam.The hadith therefore makes the Stone asupernatural creature, endowed with consciousness and eschatological authority—functionally similar to idols in other pagan religions.3. Historical Origins: The Pagan Roots of Stone Worship in ArabiaBefore Islam, the Arabs widely practicedstone-veneration:Tribes keptstone idols(e.g., al-Lat, al-Uzza, Manat).Many tribes carried portable stones from the Kaaba to serve as household gods.Pilgrims venerated stones, circled shrines, and performed kissing rituals.According to early Islamic historians (Ibn Ishaq, al-Tabari):The Black Stone was part of pre-Islamic idol rituals.The Quraysh performedtawaflong before Islam.Muhammad himself participated in pagan rituals before declaring prophethood.Thus, the Black Stone ritual predates Islam by centuries.4. The Qur’an’s Silence and Theological ProblemCritically:The Qur’an never commands Muslims to kiss the Black Stone.It never states that the stone has spiritual power.It never says the stone is from God.It never explains why the stone is necessary for salvation or worship.This exposes a deep inconsistency:If the Black Stone were essential to Islamic faith, why is it absent from the Qur’an?All authority for the ritual comes fromhadith, not Scripture.5. Biblical and Theological Critique: Stone Veneration as PaganismThe Bible clearly condemns the veneration of stones:Leviticus 26:1– “Do not set up an image or asacred stone.”Deuteronomy 16:22– “Do not erect a sacred stone, for the Lord your God hates them.”Isaiah 44:9–20mocks those who worship objects made of created matter.True monotheism forbids:attributing supernatural powers to objects,believing a stone can intercede,performing rituals to earn divine favor through a physical object.Therefore, kissing a stone is not merely unnecessary—it istheologically incompatiblewith the monotheism of previous prophets.6. Umar ibn al-Khattab’s Confession: The Stone Has No PowerThe second caliph, Umar, famously admitted:“I know that you are a stone that can neither harm nor benefit.If I had not seen the Prophet kiss you, I would not kiss you.”—Sahih al-Bukhari 1597This statement confirms:The stone hasno power—yet Muslims kiss it anyway.The practice imitates the Prophet, not God.Even the earliest Muslim leaders struggled to justify it.It contradicts Qur’anic teachings that only Allah benefits or harms.7. Critical Theological Questions for IslamBelow areexpanded academic questionsexposing the contradictions:1. If Allah is all-powerful, why must humans kiss a stone to receive spiritual testimony or blessings?2. Why would a merciful God endow a stone with eyes and a tongue? What is its metaphysical purpose?3. How is kissing a stone fundamentally different from pagan idol-veneration condemned in the Bible?4. Why does the Qur’an remain silent on a ritual so central to Islamic identity?5. If touching the stone “in truth” earns spiritual merit, does this not introduce a form ofworks-based salvationmediated through a physical object?6. What is the mechanism by which a stone recognizes sincerity, truth, falsehood, or faith?7. If the Black Stone will speak on Judgment Day, does it share in divine attributes?8. Why does Islam condemn polytheists for venerating stones, while requiring Muslims to venerate one specific stone?9. If the Stone truly came from heaven, why did Muhammad replace its pagan function rather than abolish it entirely?10. How is Muhammad’s continuation of pagan stone rituals compatible with the Abrahamic faith he claimed to restore?8. ConclusionThe practice of kissing the Black Stone is not grounded in divine revelation, biblical monotheism, or rational theology. Instead, it represents a directcontinuity of Arabian pagan practices, re-packaged within Islamic ritual. The hadith granting the Stoneeyes, a tongue, and eschatological authorityreveals a theological contradiction incompatible with true monotheism.Islam’s attempt to purge paganism is undermined by its preservation of one of the most distinctive pagan symbols of pre-Islamic Arabia.",

IntroductionWithin Islamic theology, the Hadith literature occupies a central position as a secondary but authoritative source for shaping doctrine, ethics, law (Sharia), and Muslim conduct. Among the most cited compilers areSahih MuslimandSahih al-Bukhari, considered by Sunni Islam as the most authentic collections after the Qur’an. Because of this elevated status, the ethical and doctrinal content found in these books can have profound implications for Islamic moral instruction.One of the most contentious ethical themes present in these texts concerns theIslamic conceptualization of adultery (zina)and its theological inevitability. The following analysis examines two canonical hadiths that assert thatevery human being has a fixed and unavoidable portion of adultery, allegedly decreed by Allah. These texts raise serious questions regarding moral responsibility, divine justice, and the concept of sin, especially when contrasted with the biblical view of holiness, human agency, and divine righteousness.This chapter critically examines these hadiths from an academic, theological, and comparative-religion perspective.2. Primary Hadith Texts Describing \"Inevitable\" Adultery2.1 Sahih Muslim, Book 33 (Destiny), Hadith 6421In the chapter entitled“The measure of the son of Adam in regard to adultery,”Abu Huraira narrates:“Verily Allah has fixed the very portion of adultery which a man will indulge in, and which he of necessity must commit. The adultery of the eye is the lustful look, and the adultery of the tongue is the licentious speech; the heart desires and yearns, which the parts may or may not put into effect.”This passage presents three theological claims:Allah has predetermined a fixed portion of adulteryfor every person.This adultery is described as something one “of necessity must commit.”Adultery is broadly defined to include:Lustful looking (zina of the eyes),Lustful speech (zina of the tongue),Internal desire,Actual physical adultery.2.2 Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 8, Book 77 (Divine Will), Hadith 609A similar narration is attributed to Ibn ʿAbbas through Abu Huraira:“Allah has written for the son of Adam his inevitable share of adultery whether he is aware of it or not… The adultery of the eye is looking (at what is unlawful), the adultery of the tongue is uttering (what is unlawful), the inner self wishes and longs for adultery, and the private parts either fulfill that act or refrain from it.”This second reference reinforces the first and emphasizes theinevitabilityandpre-written natureof each individual’s involvement in adultery.3. Doctrinal Implications of the Hadith Claims3.1 The Concept of Divine Decree (Al-Qadar)These hadiths locate adultery within the larger Islamic doctrine ofal-qadar—the belief that all events are pre-written by Allah. The explicit statement that adultery is “written,” “fixed,” and “inevitable” suggests that human moral agency is overshadowed by divine determinism.In classical Islamic theology, the tension between divine decree and human freedom is well-known. However, these particular hadiths push the argument further by assigninga mandatory divine portion of a moral sinto every human being.3.2 Ethical ConsequencesIf Allah decrees adultery as:inevitable,fixed, andsomething a man must commit,then several ethical problems arise:Human responsibility is undermined.If sin is divinely mandated, accountability becomes philosophically incoherent.Moral agency collapses.A predetermined moral failure cannot be genuinely considered a sin in any meaningful sense.Divine justice becomes contradictory.Punishing individuals for actions they were divinely compelled to perform contradicts universal principles of justice.3.3 Redefinition of AdulteryThe hadiths also expand the definition of adultery to include internal temptation, desire, and involuntary reactions such as looking. This redefinition results in:A blurring of categories betweentemptationandsin,Assigning guilt to normal human cognition,Presenting desire as something divinely decreed rather than morally chosen.This sweeping definition stands in sharp contrast to biblical teaching, which distinguishes:Temptation(which is not sin),Consent to sin,The act of sin itself.4. Comparative Theological Reflection (Islam vs. Bible)4.1 Human Responsibility in ScriptureThe Bible consistently affirms that:Sin is a human choice (Genesis 4:7),God does not tempt or compel anyone to sin (James 1:13–15),Moral responsibility is inseparable from free will (Joshua 24:15).In Christian theology, God is holy (Leviticus 11:44; 1 Peter 1:16) and cannot “fix a portion of sin” for anyone. Sin arises not from divine decree but from human desire misaligned with God’s will.4.2 Jesus’ TeachingJesus’ teaching on adultery (Matthew 5:27–28) acknowledges that lustful intent is sinful, but He never teaches that such sin is:Inevitable,Divinely assigned, orNecessitated by God.Instead, Christ calls believers to holiness empowered by the Spirit (Galatians 5:16–17).4.3 Divine Justice and HolinessThe biblical view of divine holiness is incompatible with a deity who ordains moral transgression. Holiness in Scripture means:God is morally perfect,His commands are righteous,Human beings are responsible moral agents.These fundamental biblical doctrines clash directly with the theological implications of the hadiths cited.5. Academic AssessmentFrom an academic, historical, and theological standpoint, these hadiths reflect:An internal Islamic struggle to reconcile deterministic theology with moral ethics,A worldview where divine decree overrides human moral agency,A significant departure from Judeo-Christian views of holiness, free will, and sin.Furthermore, the presence of such teachings inSahih MuslimandSahih al-Bukhari—sources held by Sunni Islam to be second only to the Qur’an—raises critical questions about the moral framework guiding Islamic anthropology and ethics.These hadiths have been used throughout Islamic history to defend deterministic understandings of human behavior, often leading to theological interpretations that minimize personal accountability.",

    "full_content": "The Misrepresentation of the Trinity in the Qur’an:A Theological Refutation of the Claim that Mary is Part of the GodheadBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteIntroductionOne of the most startling and historically inaccurate assertions in the Qur’an is its depiction of the Christian doctrine of the Trinity. InSurah al-Ma’idah 5:116, the Qur’an records Allah as allegedly questioning Jesus:“And [beware the Day] when Allah will say, ‘O Jesus, son of Mary, did you say to the people, ‘Take me and my mother as deities besides Allah?’”This verse implies that Christians worship a triad consisting of Allah, Jesus, and Mary. The theological problem with this portrayal is obvious: at no point in the two millennia of Christian doctrine—whether in Scripture, Patristics, Catholic, Orthodox, or Protestant theology—has Mary ever been considered a member of the Trinity. This Qur’anic statement is not only a misrepresentation of Christian faith but also evidence that the Qur’an is not divine revelation. A true God would not misrepresent the faith of His people.The Christian Doctrine of the TrinityChristianity has always confessedone God in three co-eternal persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit(cf. Matthew 28:19; 2 Corinthians 13:14). From the Nicene Creed of 325 A.D. to the Athanasian Creed, this Trinitarian confession has been universally held. Mary, while venerated as theTheotokos(“Mother of God” in the sense of giving birth to Christ in His humanity), has never been elevated to divine status within orthodox Christianity.Even in the highest forms of Marian devotion within Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox traditions, Mary remains acreature, a servant of God, and never a deity. To suggest otherwise is to invent a caricature of Christian theology.The Qur’an’s ErrorThe Qur’an’s reference to Mary as a member of the divine triad demonstrates either:A profound misunderstanding of Christian doctrineon Muhammad’s part.A deliberate distortionintended to ridicule Christian belief.Both options disqualify the Qur’an as divine revelation. For if Allah were truly omniscient, He would not misrepresent what Christians believed. This is a theological impossibility—God cannot lie (Titus 1:2; Numbers 23:19).Thus, if the Qur’an asserts that Christians worship Mary as part of the Godhead, when no Christian sect in history has ever held such a belief, then the Qur’an has borne false witness. This exposes both the Qur’an and Muhammad as unreliable and false.Patristic and Historical WitnessThe writings of the early Church Fathers (e.g., Irenaeus, Tertullian, Athanasius, Augustine) consistently articulate the Trinitarian doctrine. The Cappadocian Fathers (Basil, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory Nazianzen) refined Trinitarian theology, distinguishing between essence (ousia) and persons (hypostases). At no point is Mary included.Even apocryphal and heretical sects never suggested Mary was divine. The Qur’anic accusation is, therefore, not based on history, but on afabricated polemic.Theological Consequence: Allah as a False DeityIf the Qur’an misrepresents Christian theology, then Allah—the speaker of the Qur’an—is a deceiver. The Bible clearly teaches that Satan is the father of lies (John 8:44). Therefore, the god of the Qur’an cannot be the true and living God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, but a counterfeit spirit.If Muhammad proclaimed this distortion as revelation, he stands exposed not as a prophet of God but as afalse prophet(Deuteronomy 18:20–22).ConclusionChristians never claimed Mary is part of the Trinity. The Qur’an’s portrayal of Mary as a deity reveals historical ignorance and theological falsehood. Since God cannot err, lie, or misrepresent, the Qur’an cannot be divine. Consequently, Muhammad is not a prophet of the true God, and the Qur’an must be rejected as revelation.The true Trinity remains:Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—the eternal God who saves.📖ReferencesHoly Bible, ESV.Nicene Creed(325 A.D.);Athanasian Creed.Augustine,De Trinitate.Basil of Caesarea,On the Holy Spirit.Al-Ma’idah 5:116, The Qur’an.",

    "full_content": "Are Camels “Devils” Yet Eaten? A Theological & Critical InquiryBy Dr Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis article examines several hadiths and Qurʾānic/biblical texts which appear to label camels as “created from devils” (shayāṭīn), yet simultaneously affords camels products (meat, milk, sometimes even urine) that are used or consumed by Muslims. The paper raises theological, ethical, and scriptural questions: Are these contradictions or resolvable tensions? What do classical and modern scholars say? And how do these positions affect faith, practice, and interreligious dialogue, especially when compared with Judaic/Christian dietary law (e.g. Leviticus)? This is meant as a challenging debate piece.Background: Texts & ClaimsHadith: “Camels’ resting-places … they were created from the devils.”Sunan Ibn Majah 769 records that the Prophet Muhammad said:“Perform prayer in the sheep’s resting-places and do not perform prayer in the camels’ resting-places,for they were created from the devils.” (prophetmuhammad.com)Camel urine / milk as medicineAnother hadith narrates that some tribes (e.g. ‘Urainah / Ukl) found the climate of Medina unfit for them; the Prophet allowed them to drink camel milk andurineas a medicine, and they recovered. Scholars differ about whether this makes camel urine “najis” (ritually impure), and whether medical use is allowed. (Pejabat Mufti Wilayah Persekutuan)Camel meat is considered halalThe general position in Islamic jurisprudence is that camels are lawful (halāl) to eat, since they are among theAnʿām(cattle/grazing animals) that are non-predatory and have flowing blood. (IslamQA)Biblical law forbidding camels’ consumptionIn Leviticus 11:3-8 and Deuteronomy 14:7-8, the Hebrew Bible states that animals which chew the cud but do not have divided (split) hooves (e.g. camels, rabbits, rock badgers) are ritually unclean and forbidden to be eaten. (YouVersion | The Bible App | Bible.com)Key Tensions & QuestionsThe following are points of tension or apparent contradiction, leading to critical questions:TensionObservationsQuestions / ChallengesLabeling camels as “created from devils” vs. using them for foodIf camels are “from devils” in some sense, what does that mean? Is it literal (they are progeny of devils), metaphorical, linguistic/poetic, or functional (because they behave in some “evil” way)? Yet camels’ meat, milk, riding, etc., are widely accepted in Islam.1. If camels are “devils,” does that render them impure, or morally suspect?  2. If “devils” implies spiritual evil, how is it consistent that they are lawful to eat? 3. Could eating camels imply eating something tainted by “devil” essence? 4. Do scholars interpret “created from devils” strictly, or as a metaphor for stubbornness, mischief, or disruptive behavior? 5. Does this hadith override or conflict with Qurʾānic verses that praise camels (e.g. as signs, for transport)?Camel urine, a “medicine,” vs purity / ritual lawThe hadith permitting camel urine as medicine is taken by some scholars as an exceptional measure in an emergency context. Meanwhile, many scholars consider animal urine “najis,” especially under certain schools. There is also modern scientific research on potential antibacterial etc. effects, but with caveats. (E-JOURNAL)1. If camel urine is impure in most cases, how can it be medicinally prescribed? 2. Was this allowance meant as general, or as specific to time/place/emergency? 3. If modern camels eat different diets and are in polluted environment, is the same ruling still valid? 4. Is there proof (beyond hadith) that the cure was effective, or is this taken on faith? 5. How do Muslims reconcile concerns of purity with use of something considered impure for treatment?Biblical law vs Islamic law re camelsThe Hebrew Bible forbids eating camels on ritual purity grounds; Islam explicitly permits camel meat. This creates a strong point of difference in interreligious theological debates.1. If some faiths classify camels as unclean, why did Islam allow them? 2. Did Muhammad reject or reinterpret biblical purity laws, or does Islam claim independent revelation that changed the rules? 3. Do Jewish and Christian prohibitions still carry moral weight, or are they superseded according to Muslim belief? 4. How do Muslims dialogue with Jews/Christians when the same creature is called forbidden in one faith but lawful in another?Scholarly Interpretations & ResponsesTo avoid caricature, here are how Islamic scholars have responded to those tensions:The fatwa on IslamWeb regarding the hadith “camels created from devils” clarifies that this does not mean camels are literally offspring of devils (jinn), but that the expression refers to their nature or behavior — e.g. camels may behave in ways that disturb prayer when they run away, or cause issues in places they rest. (islamweb.org)On drinking camel urine: it is generally treated as an exceptional case for medical necessity; many scholars assert that while the hadith is authentic, it does not establish a general rule that camel urine is pure or to be regularly consumed. (Pejabat Mufti Wilayah Persekutuan)On meat: there is consensus among Sunni schools that camel meat is halal. As long as the animal is slaughtered according to Islamic law, it is lawful. The fact that some animals are labelled “filed under Anʿām” (grazing beasts) in Qurʾān supports that camels are part of the lawful category. (IslamQA)Additional Critical Questions for DebateBelow are further questions that push at the contradictions more deeply, suitable for scholars, theologians, and students to consider.Semantic vs Literal Meaning: When a text says camels were “created from devils,” is this a metaphor? If so, what criteria do scholars use to determine metaphorical language in hadiths? If literal, then how does that square with other hadiths or Qurʾān that treat camels positively?Authority and Interpretation: Who determines whether a hadith’s phrase is literal, metaphorical, or hyperbolic? How much weight do linguistic, contextual, cultural, historical, and medical knowledge play in interpreting these hadiths today?Medical vs Religious Norms: When a hadith prescribes a remedy (milk + urine), is that command religious or medical? What are the implications if science now shows risks, or if environmental changes make the remedy dangerous? Can religious law adapt?Purity and Ritual Impurity: If something labeled “from devils” might be considered spiritually impure, does that influence ritual law (e.g. wudu, prayer, handling, etc.) regarding camel meat, urine, or their resting places?Moral and Ethical Implications: What are the ethical implications of eating animals associated with “evil” in scripture? Does this morally stain the consumer? How is this justified in Islamic theology?Interreligious Dialogue: How do Muslims respond when interlocutors point to biblical injunctions forbidding camels, to challenge the legitimacy of Islamic law? Is there a theological account of divine revelation supersession, continuity, or divergence?Consistency and Coherence: Islamic law makes various judgments: camels are lawful, meat is permissible, milk is beneficial, yet some hadiths caution against certain conditions (resting places, urine, etc.). Do all these form a coherent system, or are there internal contradictions?Contextualization & Time-Boundness: To what extent were these hadiths shaped by the environment (7th-century Arabia) and cultural practices? Could some rulings or sayings have been more applicable then than now? If so, what happens when contexts change (public health, environment, veterinary science, etc.)?Reliability and Grading of Texts: How strong are the chains of narration for the relevant hadiths? Do weak or less-accepted hadiths contribute to misunderstandings? For example, is there disagreement among scholars about the strength of the hadith that camels are from devils?Practical Outcomes for Believers: Given these tensions, how are ordinary Muslims supposed to behave? Should they avoid praying in camel resting places? Should they eat camel meat as usual? Should they avoid camel urine even when it was traditionally used? How much of this is theological vs legal vs cultural?ConclusionThe texts concerning camels in Islamic tradition present challenging tensions: on the one hand, sayings that seem to cast camels in a negative light (“from devils”); on the other hand, camels are lawful animals whose products (meat, milk) are used, and in some cases urine has been permitted in medical contexts.These contradictions are not necessarily fatal; many theological systems allow for metaphor, specificity, exception, and context. But they raise serious questions:Are some hadiths being misunderstood or taken out of context?Are certain practices (eating camel, using camel urine) justified on grounds of necessity, revelation, or medical benefit, even if they clash with intuitive notions of purity?How do Muslims reconcile these texts with their faith in the consistency and moral coherence of their scripture?This piece is offered not as an attack but as a call for rigorous scholarly debate. For honest dialogue, clarity of interpretation, transparency about levels of authority (Qurʾān vs hadith vs juristic opinion), and sensitivity to how believers understand these texts are essential.",

This foundational claim underscores both the divine identity of Christ and His role in revealing the ultimate reality of human existence. Through His truth, individuals are granted insight into their inherent identity as children of God, regardless of past experiences, adverse circumstances, or personal misconceptions.The Christian understanding of human identity emphasizes that the lies and distortions imposed by others or even internalized by oneself cannot supersede the reality of divine truth (John 16:13). In Christ, believers are acknowledged as children of God, endowed with spiritual authority and purpose to accomplish works that glorify God (Ephesians 2:10). This divine affirmation conveys acceptance, love, and empowerment, revealing that every believer has a strategic role in advancing the kingdom of God on earth. The promise of God’s Spirit to guide believers into all truth ensures that His followers are continually aligned with His divine purposes and truths, shaping a life of spiritual effectiveness and eternal significance.In conclusion, the life of a Christian is anchored in the truth of Jesus Christ, whose divinity and teachings provide not only the way to salvation but also the foundation for living a life of empowered purpose and eternal hope. Recognizing this truth enables believers to overcome deception, embrace their divine identity, and anticipate the great works God has prepared for them.ReferencesHoly Bible, English Standard Version.

Yet the Qurʾān itself contains verses that — when read plainly and in their exegetical context — speak of Jesus’ death (and later resurrection/raising). Likewise, some ḥadīth literature and classical tafsīr treat his death as an eventual reality (whether before or after the eschatological return). This article lays out the Qurʾānic and ḥadīth evidence that supports the proposition “Jesus dies,” asks why a straightforward reading is often resisted, and invites Muslim scholars to reconcile apparent tensions honestly and transparently.1. Plain Qurʾānic Statements that Speak of DeathTwo Qurʾānic verses are central to this discussion:Sūrat Maryam (19:33).The infant ʿĪsā speaks: “And peace be upon me the day I was born, the day I die, and the day I shall be raised alive.” This is an explicit first-person declaration that includes the day “I die.” The verse appears in the cradle-speech narrative and is unambiguous in wording. (Quran.com)Sūrat Āl ʿImrān (3:55).In many translations and readings this verse contains the verbmutawaffīka(I will cause you to die / will cause you to be taken in death) followed byrafiʿuka(I will exalt you). Numerous readers and exegetes point out that the sequence—death followed by exaltation—naturally reads as death preceding the elevation. (Those who argue for an interpretation that means “I will cause you to be taken up alive” must explain the grammatical and contextual difficulty such readings introduce.) (Al Hakam)These two verses together form strong textual ground for the claim that the Qurʾān envisages a genuine death for ʿĪsā (either in history or as a final event).Load-bearing claim citation:the literal text of 19:33 and the wording and readings of 3:55 are primary evidence. (Quran.com)2. The Commonly Cited Verse of Denial (4:157) — What It Says and What It Does NotSūrat An-Nisāʾ (4:157) reads in many translations: “And [for] their saying, ‘Indeed, we killed the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary’ — but they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him; it was made to appear so to them…” This verse is the scriptural basis for the widespread Muslim claim that Jesus was neither crucified nor killed. (Quran.com)However, there are several interpretive pathways Muslims have taken:Apparent substitution theory:someone was made to resemble Jesus and was crucified in his stead (classical view).Apparent-vision theory:the crucifixion was an illusion; Jesus was neither crucified nor killed.Spiritual/representational readings:the verse denies any salvific or ontological significance to the crucifixion rather than denying an actual bodily death.Each interpretation attempts to reconcile 4:157 with other Qurʾānic statements. But none of these interpretive moves removes the plain meaning of 19:33 or 3:55; rather, they read 4:157 as denying the Jewish/Christian boast “we killed him,” while still permitting Jesus’ eventual death in God’s timing. Readers should face the cognitive tension: how do we reconcile a verse that plainly says “I die” with another that says “they did not kill him”?Load-bearing claim citation:the language of 4:157 and the existence of multiple classical readings. (Quran.com)3. Classical Tafsīr and Scholarly Notes That Recognize Jesus’ DeathClassical exegetes register the wording of 19:33 and treat it as significant. For example, Ibn Kathīr and other commentators note the phrase “the day I die” and discuss narrations and readings that speak of Jesus’ death and his being raised. Some modern Muslim writers also point to 3:55’s wording (mutawaffīka) as an admission of death followed by exaltation. Tafsīr collections and commentaries often wrestle with how to harmonize these verses with 4:157. (QuranX)Thus, there is a long exegetical history that acknowledges the textual problem and treats Jesus’ death as a theologically meaningful datum in some senses.Load-bearing claim citation:tafsīr references for 19:33 and 3:55. (QuranX)4. Ḥadīth and Later TraditionsSeveral post-Qurʾānic traditions and Muslim histories treat Jesus’ earthly existence as culminating in death (especially after his eschatological return). Works that collect prophetic reports or later historical accounts — for instance, writings that quote earlier exegetical traditions — sometimes assert that ʿĪsā will return, live a period of years, and then die and be buried. Ibn al-Jawzī’sAl-Wafāʾand related reports preserve traditions that the Prophet (or early transmitters) spoke of Jesus’ eventual death and burial. While hadith evidence varies in strength and provenance, the presence of such traditions in the Muslim corpus complicates the absolutist claim “the Qurʾān and ḥadīth uniformly deny Jesus’ death.” (Hadith of the Day)Load-bearing claim citation:presence of post-Qurʾānic traditions speaking of death after return. (Hadith of the Day)5. Questions for Muslim Theologians and BelieversHow do you reconcile 19:33’s plain “the day I die” with a strict, universal denial that Jesus ever died?If 19:33 is literal, whose death is being referenced if not Jesus’?What grammatical and contextual arguments justify readingmutawaffīkain 3:55 as other than death?Several exegetes take that verb to mean “cause to die” — if so, why prefer interpretive moves that avoid death?Does 4:157 deny only the Jewish/Christian boast (“we killed him”) rather than every possible death of Jesus?If so, what interpretive mechanism distinguishes “they did not kill him” from “he will never die”?When later Muslim traditions speak of Jesus returning and then dying, how are those traditions to be weighed against the common modern claim that Islam uniformly denies Jesus’ death?Are those traditions to be dismissed, explained away, or accepted?These are not mere rhetorical questions: they are invitations to fuller exegesis and to honest engagement with texts and traditions.6. Expository Commentary: A Concise Argument That Jesus DiedLiteral reading of 19:33— the infant Jesus’ words include “the day I die.” A literal, face-value reading affirms death. (Quran.com)Syntactic reading of 3:55— the phrasemutawaffīkais commonly rendered “I will cause you to die/ I will take you in death”; the sequencing (death then exaltation) favors death preceding exaltation. (Al Hakam)4:157 does not necessarily preclude death— it emphatically denies thattheykilled him or that they achieved the boastful claim “we killed the Messiah.” It can be read as a denial of the perpetrators’ claim, not a metaphysical denial of any death. (Quran.com)Historical/traditional layers— later Muslim writings and some hadith strands describe Jesus’ return, subsequent life, and eventual death — indicating that at least some streams within Islamic tradition accept the concept of Jesus’ death. (Hadith of the Day)Taken together, these points make a strong prima facie case that the Qurʾān and Islamic tradition do not unambiguously require a perpetual denial of Jesus’ death.7. Conclusion and an Open Scholarly ChallengeIf Muslims insist on a total and perpetual denial that Jesus ever died, they must offer robust explanations for:the plain wording of 19:33 (“the day I die”);the grammatical implications of 3:55 (mutawaffīka); andthe existence of later traditions that speak of Jesus’ death after his return.I invite Muslim exegetes to publish careful, fully documented responses that engage the verses and narrations above directly — not by assertion, but by argument.

    "full_content": "The Historical Treatment of Christians under Islamic Rule: Lessons for Contemporary Western PolicyBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis paper examines the historical status of Christian communities under Islamic governance, particularly during the so-called “Golden Age of Islam.” It highlights the social, legal, and economic challenges faced by Christians asdhimmi(“protected but subjugated people”) within the Islamic caliphates. The discussion then extends to contemporary Western policies on religious coexistence and migration, urging policymakers to reflect on historical precedents in order to safeguard religious freedom and cultural identity.1. IntroductionThroughout history, relations between Muslims and Christians in the Middle East have been complex and often asymmetrical. While Islamic civilization is frequently lauded for its intellectual and scientific advancements during the medieval era, less attention is given to the social realities experienced by non-Muslims, particularly Christians, who formed the majority population in regions such as Egypt, Syria, and Mesopotamia before the Islamic conquests of the 7th century (Lewis, 1984).2. The Dhimmi System and Its ImplicationsUnder Islamic law (sharia), Christians and Jews were recognized asAhl al-Kitab(“People of the Book”) and permitted to practice their religion; however, they were subjected to thedhimmacontract, a system of protection in exchange for political and social subordination. This included the payment of a special poll tax known asjizya(Qur’an 9:29), which symbolized their inferior status and served as a visible marker of their submission to Islamic authority (Bat Ye’or, 1985).Historical records indicate that non-Muslims were restricted in various ways:They were prohibited from building new churches or repairing old ones without official permission.They were required to wear distinguishing clothing or badges in certain regions.They were sometimes compelled to step aside or walk behind Muslims in public spaces.Legal testimony by Christians was often invalid in Muslim courts (Lewis, 1995; Stillman, 1979).Such measures contributed to systemic social inequality, often leading to the gradual decline of Christian communities in the Middle East. Many converted to Islam under economic or political pressure, while others migrated to preserve their faith and freedom.3. Historical Consequences for Christian Civilization in the EastThe cumulative impact of these restrictions led to a significant demographic and cultural transformation. Once-flourishing centers of Christian thought — such as Antioch, Alexandria, and Edessa — witnessed the erosion of their religious identity. By the late Middle Ages, Christians had become minorities in lands where they had previously been dominant (Shaw, 1970).This historical pattern invites reflection on the fragility of religious coexistence under ideologically exclusive systems. The experience of Eastern Christians serves as a cautionary tale for societies that value pluralism and equality under the law.4. Implications for Modern Western SocietiesIn modern Europe and North America, where Christianity has historically shaped cultural and moral foundations, policymakers face the challenge of balancing religious tolerance with the preservation of national identity and security. Immigration and multicultural policies must be informed by historical awareness — ensuring that openness does not lead to cultural erosion or the marginalization of Christian values that underpin Western civilization (Huntington, 1996).The lessons of history suggest that tolerance must be coupled with prudence. Genuine coexistence depends not merely on goodwill but on mutual respect, legal reciprocity, and the rejection of supremacist ideologies from any quarter. The West must ensure that religious liberty remains a two-way principle: freedom for all, not submission for some.5. ConclusionHistory demonstrates that imbalance in religious and political power can erode the fabric of coexistence. The plight of Middle Eastern Christians under Islamic rule offers vital insight for contemporary governance: liberty must be protected by law, informed by history, and guided by justice. Western nations, while remaining compassionate and inclusive, must also preserve the moral and cultural foundations that have enabled freedom, prosperity, and faith to flourish.ReferencesBat Ye’or.The Dhimmi: Jews and Christians under Islam.

    "full_content": "Title: A Scholarly Debate on Ishmael’s Lineage and the Ethnic Origins of MuhammadBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThe Islamic tradition holds that the Prophet Muhammad is a direct descendant of Ishmael, the son of Abraham and Hagar. This genealogical claim is foundational to Islamic identity, as it connects Muhammad—and therefore Islam—to the Abrahamic covenantal line. However, when examined through both scriptural and historical lenses, this claim raises several inconsistencies. A critical question arises:if Ishmael’s mother was Egyptian and his wife was also Egyptian, does this not imply that his descendants—if traceable—would be African rather than Arabian?This academic inquiry aims to provoke a theological and historical debate by juxtaposing the biblical narrative with Islamic claims. The purpose is not to diminish faith but to invite reasoned dialogue rooted in textual integrity and historical truth.1. The Biblical Account: Ishmael’s African ConnectionAccording toGenesis 16:1–12andGenesis 21:9–21, Hagar, the mother of Ishmael, was an Egyptian handmaiden of Sarah. Later, asGenesis 21:21records, Hagar took a wife for Ishmaelfrom the land of Egypt. This means Ishmael was the child of an Egyptian mother and married an Egyptian woman—making both his maternal and marital lines African in origin.Rabbinic commentary inGenesis Rabbah 53:15reinforces this by citing the proverb:“Throw a stick into the air, and it will always fall on its end.”In context, this saying means that Hagar, being Egyptian, naturally chose an Egyptian wife for her son.Thus, if Ishmael’s lineage continued biologically,his offspring would have carried Egyptian (African) blood.2. The Islamic Claim: Muhammad as a Descendant of IshmaelIslamic tradition asserts that Muhammad descended from Ishmael through his sonKedar(Qidar). This claim, however, lacks direct historical documentation before Islam emerged in the 7th century CE. There existsno continuous genealogical recordlinking Ishmael to Muhammad. The genealogy is largely retrospective—constructed after Muhammad’s lifetime to affirm his prophetic legitimacy within the Abrahamic line.Critical Questions:Where is the documented genealogical chain from Ishmael to Muhammad found before the 7th century?How can Ishmael’s African lineage be reconciled with the claim that Muhammad was purely Arab?If Arabs claim descent from Ishmael, does this not also imply that they share African ancestry through Hagar?Why do many Muslims reject any notion that Muhammad could have had African blood when their own tradition connects Ishmael to Egypt?3. Historical and Ethnological AnalysisThe termEgyptianin the biblical sense refers to people ofNorth African descent, part of the Hamitic line (Genesis 10:6). Therefore, Ishmael’s genealogy is partly Hamitic through Hagar and his Egyptian wife, and partly Semitic through Abraham. Any claim of pure Semitic descent through Ishmael ignores this dual heritage.Furthermore, ancient Arab tribes such as theQedariteswere nomadic groups in northwestern Arabia, but their ethnic composition was not uniform. Archaeological and linguistic evidence suggests significant African influence and intermarriage in those regions.If we accept the Islamic claim that Muhammad descended from Ishmael,logic dictates that Muhammad’s ancestry was at least partially African.Yet, this conclusion is often rejected in Islamic discourse, revealing a contradiction between faith-based genealogy and ethnological reality.4. The Debate: A Call for ConsistencyMuslims must face one of two possibilities:If Muhammad is indeed a descendant of Ishmael, then by scriptural and historical reasoning, he carried African (Egyptian) blood.If Muhammad was not African, then the claim that he descended from Ishmael collapses, since Ishmael’s lineage is inextricably tied to Egypt.Therefore, the question remains:“Can Islam uphold Muhammad’s Ishmaelite heritage without acknowledging his African ancestry?”If not, then perhaps the genealogical claim itself was theological rather than historical—a symbolic link to Abraham to grant Muhammad prophetic legitimacy.5. Scholarly ConclusionThis debate exposes a fundamental tension in Islamic historiography: the desire to connect Muhammad to Abraham through Ishmael, while distancing him from Africa through Hagar.But the biblical record is unambiguous—Hagar and Ishmael’s line began in Egypt.Hence, the argument concludes:Either Muhammad was an African by descent through Ishmael,Or he hadno genealogical connection to Ishmael at all.Until verifiable historical evidence bridges this 2,500-year genealogical gap, the claim remainsa theological assertion rather than a historical fact.Final Provocative Question:If Islam insists on an Abrahamic lineage through Ishmael, will it also embrace the African heritage inherent in that lineage—or continue to deny it in pursuit of an Arabized identity?By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteOrlando, Florida, USA",

    "full_content": "Divine Uncertainty in Qur’an 47:28: A Theological Inquiry into Allah’s “Installation”By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis article investigates the peculiar expression inQur’an 47:28, where Allah is portrayed as “installing” or “setting” (imlāʾ) something within the disbelievers, which raises profound questions about divine certainty, omniscience, and intentionality in the Qur’anic text. The study employs comparative theological analysis, hermeneutical exegesis, and linguistic critique to uncover whether the verse implies divine uncertainty or a reactive, rather than sovereign, mode of action in Allah’s dealings with human beings.1. Introduction: The Problem of Divine Intention in Qur’an 47:28Qur’an 47:28 states:“That is because they followed what angered Allah and disliked what pleased Him, so He made their deeds fruitless.”(Qur’an 47:28, Sahih International)However, several classical and modern translations also render key verbs in ways that suggestinstallation,deliberate placement, orallowance— terms which carry semantic connotations of gradual process, testing, or even hesitation. The Arabic phrasefa-ahbaṭa a‘mālahum(“so He made their deeds fruitless”) and related interpretive commentaries imply an intervention that occursafter observation, not by predetermined decree.This raises critical theological questions:If Allah’s omniscience is perfect, why must He “install” or “set” reactions after observing human choices?Does this imply that Allah’s judgment is contingent upon unfolding events?How can an all-knowing deity “test” what He already knows with absolute certainty?2. Linguistic and Exegetical Analysis of “Installation” (إملاء)The Arabic termimlāʾ(from the rootm-l-y) occurs in several Qur’anic passages (e.g., 3:178; 7:183), often translated as “granting respite,” “installing,” or “allowing delay.” This verb is sometimes used to describe Allah’s extended patience toward sinners before punishment.Yet, the morphology of the word suggestsprocessrather thanfinality. It depicts a deity who acts through stages, waiting, observing, and then implementing outcomes based on human response.In classicaltafsīrworks (e.g.,Tafsir al-Tabari,Tafsir al-Qurtubi), scholars attempted to reconcile this with Allah’s omniscience by claiming thatimlāʾrefers to divine testing (ibtilāʾ). However, testing presupposes uncertainty about the test’s result — a philosophical contradiction to omniscience.This invites deeper inquiry:Why does Allah “grant time” or “install” disbelief rather than instantaneously decreeing it?Doesimlāʾreflect a temporal learning process within Allah’s actions?Can a timeless being operate within temporal delay?3. Theological Implications: Is Allah Reactive or Proactive?The Qur’an often portrays Allah asreactingto human behavior: rewarding faith, cursing disbelief, or altering decrees based on obedience (Qur’an 13:39; 8:53). InQur’an 47:28, this reactive tendency is evident — Allah responds to their dislike of what pleases Him by nullifying their deeds.In contrast, the Biblical God declares,“I am the Lord, I change not”(Malachi 3:6) and“Known unto God are all His works from the beginning of the world”(Acts 15:18). The Biblical framework depicts omniscience as an eternal constancy, not adaptive reaction.Hence, the question arises:Does the Qur’an’s Allah act sequentially, responding to events as they occur?If so, can divine knowledge in Islam be truly eternal and unchanging?Does Allah’s “installation” of delay suggest dependence on human decision-making to complete His will?4. The Problem of Divine Psychology: Is Allah Testing Himself?If Allah’s “installation” implies that He must observe before judging, this introduces a divine cognitive process resemblinghuman reasoning. This anthropomorphic depiction contradicts the classical Islamic doctrine oftanzīh(absolute transcendence), which asserts that Allah is beyond time, space, and human emotion.Yet, Qur’an 47:28 and related verses describe Allah as being angered, pleased, or testing believers. Such human-like emotions raise theological tension:Can an immutable being become “angry” or “pleased”?Is Allah’s decision-making process an evolving response rather than a predetermined decree?If Allah installs disbelief or guidance progressively, is He learning from human actions?5. Comparative Reflection: Divine Certainty in the Bible vs. Qur’anIn the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures, God’s foreknowledge precedes creation itself (Isaiah 46:10; Romans 8:29). There is no notion of divine installation or delay because God’s decrees are absolute, not observational.By contrast, the Qur’anic Allah’s behavior appears inconsistent with omniscient sovereignty. He “tests” to know (Qur’an 47:31), “changes” decrees (Qur’an 13:39), and “installs” or “grants time” (Qur’an 47:28; 3:178).Thus, the philosophical debate centers on whether the Qur’anic portrayal of Allah reflectsepistemic limitation— an unfolding divine consciousness tied to time and human action — or whether these are merely metaphors misunderstood by interpreters.6. Conclusion: A Call for Re-examining Qur’anic TheismQur’an 47:28 exposes deep theological ambiguity. The “installation” language challenges the coherence of Allah’s omniscience, sovereignty, and immutability. The Qur’an’s God appears to operate within temporal frameworks, responding to human choices rather than governing from eternal certainty.This invites broader philosophical and theological questions:If Allah must install, test, or wait, can He be truly omniscient?Is the Qur’an’s deity engaged in temporal trial and error?Does this reveal an evolving concept of God in early Islamic theology?Or does it point to a fundamentally human authorship behind the Qur’an, reflecting psychological projection rather than divine omniscience?ReferencesThe Qur’an, Surah 47:28, 3:178, 7:183, 13:39, 8:53, 47:31.Al-Tabari,Jāmiʿ al-Bayān ʿan Taʾwīl Āy al-Qurʾān.Al-Qurtubi,Al-Jāmiʿ li-Aḥkām al-Qurʾān.Ibn Kathir,Tafsir al-Qur’an al-ʿAzim.Cragg, Kenneth.The Event of the Qur’an: Islam in Its Scripture.

Drawing from both biblical and Qur’anic texts, the study argues that while Jehovah (Yahweh) demonstrates universal love and equality toward all humanity, the Allah of Islam appears to exhibit favoritism, particularly toward the Arabs. The paper further examines the implications of this theological contrast for global salvation, divine justice, and the universality of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.1. IntroductionOne of the core attributes of the Judeo-Christian God is Hisimpartiality—His equal love and redemptive invitation extended to all people without ethnic, racial, or national distinction. The God of the Bible is revealed as the Creator of all humankind, offering salvation through Jesus Christ universally.Conversely, when one studies the Qur’an, it becomes evident thatAllah’s favor is often directed specifically toward the Arabs, the initial recipients of Islam. This contrast invites an important question in comparative theology:Can a deity who favors a single ethnic group truly represent the universal Creator of all?2. The Biblical Foundation of Divine ImpartialityThe doctrine of God’s impartiality is deeply rooted in both the Old and New Testaments.Romans 2:11explicitly states:“For there is no respect of persons with God.”Likewise,Acts 10:34–35affirms:“Then Peter opened his mouth and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons: but in every nation he that feareth Him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with Him.”These verses underscore a fundamental truth: God’s relationship with humanity is based on faith and righteousness—not ethnicity, nationality, or social status.From Genesis to Revelation, Jehovah’s redemptive plan is inclusive and global. Through Jesus Christ, the “second Adam,” humanity is offered reconciliation and eternal life (Romans 5:18–19).3. The Qur’anic Depiction of Allah’s FavoritismIn contrast, the Qur’an portrays Allah as a deity who demonstratespreferential treatment toward a specific group, often the Arabs or the followers of Islam.A critical verse that reveals this selective favor is found inSurah Al-Ma’idah (5:3):“This day I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favor upon you, and chosen for you Islam as your religion.”The phrase“chosen for you Islam”(Arabic:wa radiytu lakumu al-islāma dīnan) suggests a divinely selective endorsement—addressed to a particular people, primarily those within Muhammad’s Arab community.The question arises:If Allah’s love and redemption are limited to those who submit to Islam, where does that leave the rest of humanity?Such exclusivity contradicts the concept of a universally loving Creator and raises serious theological and moral implications regarding divine justice and equity.4. The God of the Bible: Universal Love and RedemptionIn sharp contrast, the God of the Bible reveals Himself as a God ofuniversal compassion and inclusivity. The most well-known verse in Christian theology declares:“For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.”—John 3:16The following verse adds:“For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.”—John 3:17Here, divine love is unconditional and global—embracing all nations, languages, and peoples. Salvation through Jesus Christ transcends geographical, ethnic, and cultural barriers.Jesus’ Great Commission further reinforces this universal mission:“And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.”—Matthew 24:14Thus, biblical theology presents a God who is not ethnocentric, but cosmocentric—whose love envelops the entire world.5. Comparative Theological AnalysisAttributeJehovah (God of the Bible)Allah (God of the Qur’an)Nature of LoveUniversal, unconditionalSelective, ethnically centeredScope of SalvationAll humanity through Christ (John 3:16)Only those who submit to Islam (Surah 3:85)Impartiality“No respect of persons” (Romans 2:11)Prefers specific groups (e.g., Quraysh Arabs)MissionGlobal evangelization (Matthew 28:19)Islamic expansion by submission or conquestRelationshipFatherly love and graceMaster-servant relationshipThis comparative framework illustrates thatthe Biblical God is universal in scope, whereasAllah’s theological model is restrictive—defined by cultural, linguistic, and geographical limitations.6. Theological ImplicationsThe concept of divine impartiality is central to understanding God’s justice and love. A God who shows favoritism cannot be the moral and eternal standard of righteousness. The biblical narrative reveals that God’s desire is that“none should perish, but that all should come to repentance”(2 Peter 3:9).Therefore, the exclusivity of Allah in the Qur’an presents amoral and theological contradictionto the universal benevolence revealed in Scripture. It confines divinity to an ethnocentric construct, undermining the universality of divine love and redemption.7. ConclusionThe study concludes thatJehovah, the God of the Bible, stands as the only truly impartial and universally loving God. His redemptive plan through Jesus Christ is inclusive of all humanity, irrespective of ethnic origin or geographical boundary.On the other hand, theQur’anic Allah exhibits partiality, favoring specific peoples and religious adherents, thereby contradicting the very essence of divine justice and love.Therefore, the Christian message remains urgent and universal:“Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.” —Hebrews 13:8Let us, then, fulfill the divine mandate to proclaim the Gospel to all nations until the return of our Lord Jesus Christ.ReferencesThe Holy Bible, King James Version (KJV).The Qur’an.Surah Al-Ma’idah (5:3); Surah Aal Imran (3:85).Romans 2:11,Acts 10:34–35,John 3:16–17,Matthew 24:14,Hebrews 13:8,2 Peter 3:9–WordProject Bible Online.Shimba, Max.Comparative Theology and the Abrahamic Faiths.Orlando: Shimba Theological Institute Press, 2022.Watt, W.

However, a critical reading of the Qur’an reveals an absence of explicit declaration where Allah directly calls Jibril anangel(malak). The question arises: If the Qur’an is the ultimate source of truth, why does it never clearly say, “Jibril is one of the angels”? This article engages in a theological and exegetical debate challenging the conventional Islamic interpretation, particularly through the lens ofSurah Al-Baqarah 2:98, where Jibril and Michael (Mikail) are mentioned separately from “the angels.”1. Introduction: The Foundational QuestionThe Qur’an, in Surah Al-Baqarah (2:98), states:“Whoever is an enemy to Allah, and His angels, and His messengers, and Jibril and Mikail, then indeed, Allah is an enemy to the disbelievers.”This verse explicitlydistinguishesbetween “angels” (mala’ikah) and “Jibril and Mikail.” The immediate linguistic and theological question is:If Jibril and Mikail are indeed angels, why are they mentioned separately from ‘the angels’?In classical Arabic rhetoric, separation of nouns within a list usually indicatescategorical distinctionrather than redundancy. Hence, this verse invites critical scrutiny:Was Jibril truly considered an angel by the Qur’an’s author, or was his nature conceptually different?2. The Missing Declaration: “Jibril is an Angel”Unlike the Bible, where Gabriel is explicitly called“the angel Gabriel”(Luke 1:26, Daniel 8:16), the Qur’annever oncedescribes Jibril using the titlemalak(angel).There isno versein the Qur’an where Allah says:“Jibril is one of My angels.”This silence raises profound theological and linguistic questions:Why is Jibril’s angelic status assumed rather than stated?If Jibril were truly an angel, why does the Qur’an not use the same grammatical structure it uses for other angels, such as the angels of death, punishment, or recording?Could Jibril have been a different class of celestial being—a spirit, or a divine messenger distinct from the angelic order?3. Qur’anic Terminology: Jibril as “Ruh” (Spirit)In multiple verses, Jibril is calledRuh al-Qudus(the Holy Spirit) orRuh al-Amin(the Trustworthy Spirit):“Say, the Holy Spirit has brought it down from your Lord in truth”(Surah An-Nahl 16:102)“The Trustworthy Spirit has brought it down upon your heart”(Surah Ash-Shu‘ara 26:193–194)If Jibril is consistently identified as aRuh(Spirit) and never explicitly as aMalak(Angel), one must ask:Are “Ruh” and “Malak” identical terms in the Qur’an?If not, why has Islamic theology merged the two into one category?Moreover, the Qur’an inSurah Al-Qadr (97:4)says:“The angels and the Spirit descend therein by permission of their Lord.”Here again,the Spirit (Ruh)is listedalongsidethe angels, implying adistinct being, not one of them.4. The Linguistic Distinction and Theological ImplicationsArabic linguists and Qur’anic commentators have long recognized thatwhen two entities are mentioned separately, it indicatesdifference of essence or category.Thus, when the Qur’an says:“The angels and the Spirit,”it cannot mean “the angels including the Spirit.”Rather, it suggests:“The angels (a class of beings) and another distinct being known as the Spirit.”Therefore, from a purely linguistic standpoint, the Qur’an consistently differentiates Jibril (the Spirit) from the angelic hosts.This raises further theological questions:If Jibril isthe Spirit, how can he simultaneously bean angel?Did early Muslims or the Qur’an’s redactors misunderstand the original Judeo-Christian references to the Holy Spirit and the angel Gabriel as separate entities?Could the conflation of “Ruh” and “Malak” reflect a later interpretive tradition rather than the Qur’an’s original intent?5. Comparative Scriptural ContextIn theBible, Gabriel is clearly defined as an angel:“I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God” (Luke 1:19).“The man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision, came to me in swift flight” (Daniel 9:21).In contrast, the Qur’an never uses such clarity.Instead, it attributes the Qur’an’s revelation toRuh al-QudusandRuh al-Amin, titles that align more with the Christian understanding of theHoly Spiritthan with an angelic messenger.Hence, one might debate:Did the Qur’an adopt the name “Jibril” from Judeo-Christian sources but reinterpret his role to fit Islamic theology?Was Jibril originally conceived as the Spirit of Revelation, not an angelic being, and only later identified as one through Islamic exegesis (tafsir)?6. Debate Questions for Muslim ScholarsTo stimulate further scholarly debate, the following critical questions should be addressed:Where in the Qur’andoes Allah directly call Jibril anangel(malak)?Why doesSurah Al-Baqarah 2:98separateJibril and Mikail from “the angels”?Why does the Qur’an refer to Jibril asRuh al-QudusandRuh al-Amin, but neverMalak Jibril?IfRuhandMalakare the same, why are they consistently distinguished in Qur’anic grammar and syntax (e.g., Surah Al-Qadr 97:4, Surah An-Nahl 16:2)?Could “Jibril” in the Qur’an represent ametaphor for divine inspiration or spirit, rather than a literal angelic being?How does Islamic theology reconcile the Qur’anic “Ruh” with the Christian concept of theHoly Spirit?7. ConclusionThe Qur’an’s portrayal of Jibril raises significant linguistic, theological, and hermeneutical questions. Nowhere is Jibril explicitly called anangel; rather, he is identified asthe Spirit. Moreover, Qur’anic verses consistently separate him from “the angels,” suggesting a distinct identity or nature.Thus, the Islamic assumption that Jibril is an angel appears to stem not from Qur’anic revelation itself but frompost-Qur’anic interpretation and theological construction.This invites a re-examination of Islamic angelology and the origin of revelation within the Qur’an’s framework—questions that remain unresolved within orthodox Islamic scholarship.Author:Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteOrlando, Florida, USA",

This turning point is not confined to one nation or culture; it is a divine work unfolding on a daily basis as hearts are being transformed by the living Christ.Former Muslims testify of visions, dreams, and miraculous encounters with Jesus, affirming the truth of the Gospel. Others are being led through the faithful witness of Christian believers who courageously share God’s Word. Each confession of faith is a victory for the Kingdom of God, and a reminder of Christ’s promise:“And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself”(John 12:32).Christians worldwide should rejoice in these testimonies. God’s Spirit is moving in unprecedented ways, breaking down barriers of fear, tradition, and cultural bondage. Yet, with this awakening comes a responsibility. The Church must rise to provide ex-Muslims with access to the Gospel, discipleship, and the solid teaching of God’s Word. These new believers, often facing rejection and persecution, need the warmth of Christian fellowship, pastoral care, and the foundation of biblical truth to grow strong in faith.AtShimba Theological Institute, we recognize this as both a prophetic sign and a divine mandate. We call upon Christians everywhere to support this movement through prayer, discipleship initiatives, and missions outreach. The harvest is plentiful, and the Lord of the harvest is at work. Let us, as the body of Christ, welcome our brothers and sisters with open arms and partner with heaven in this global revival.“The Lord has done great things for us, and we are filled with joy.”– Psalm 126:3📖Shimba Theological InstituteEquipping the Church.

    "full_content": "Title:Miracles and Prophetic Integrity: A Theological Comparison between Jesus and MuhammadAuthor:Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis article explores the nature, purpose, and theological authenticity of the miracles attributed to Jesus Christ in the Bible and those ascribed to Muhammad in Islamic sources. Grounded in Christian and Islamic textual analysis, this study argues that the miracles of Jesus were acts of compassion and divine confirmation, while the miracles associated with Muhammad—often supernatural in form—lack historical corroboration and deviate from biblical prophetic tradition. Furthermore, the study critiques apocryphal attributions that portray Jesus as performing trivial wonders, suggesting such accounts are inconsistent with the nature of biblical revelation.IntroductionThe use of miracles in religious texts often serves as divine validation of a prophet's message. However, not all miracle claims are equal in theological coherence, moral intent, or historical verification. Within Christian theology, miracles are acts of divine mercy and signs pointing to the kingdom of God (John 20:30-31). In contrast, many miracles attributed to Muhammad in Hadith literature are either unverifiable or serve no clear salvific or compassionate function. This article seeks to examine the authenticity, purpose, and theological consistency of such miracles by comparing biblical narratives of Jesus and the apostles with Islamic traditions surrounding Muhammad.1. Jesus' Miracles: Divine Power with CompassionJesus' miracles, as recorded in the New Testament, are rooted in love, compassion, and the affirmation of His divine mission. His first miracle—turning water into wine at Cana—was not for spectacle but to spare a poor couple from social disgrace (John 2:1–11). His acts of healing the blind (Mark 10:46–52), cleansing lepers (Luke 17:11–19), feeding multitudes (Matthew 14:13–21), casting out demons (Mark 5:1–20), and raising the dead (John 11:1–44) reflect divine compassion rather than showmanship.Significantly, Jesus never performed miracles for entertainment. His ministry emphasized the kingdom of God, repentance, and reconciliation (Luke 4:18–19). Unlike pagan miracle-workers or mythological figures, Jesus’ signs were consistent with Old Testament prophecy (Isaiah 35:5–6) and served to authenticate His identity as the Messiah and Son of God.2. Apocryphal Accounts and the Clay Bird StoryThe Qur’an presents a story in which Jesus creates a bird from clay and breathes life into it (Qur’an 3:49; 5:110). This narrative does not appear in the canonical Gospels but closely resembles stories from theInfancy Gospel of Thomas, a non-canonical text composed in the second century and rejected by the early Church as heretical.Church Fathers such as Irenaeus and Origen dismissed these writings as Gnostic fabrications with no apostolic authority. Scholars note that these stories reflect a distorted image of Jesus, portraying Him as a child magician rather than the Messiah (Ehrman, 2003). Thus, the Qur'anic inclusion of such narratives, while affirming Jesus’ miraculous birth, borrows from apocryphal sources rather than from divinely preserved Scripture.3. Old Testament Prophets: Purposeful and Verifiable SignsBiblical prophets such as Moses, Elijah, and Elisha performed miracles as signs of divine authority and for the deliverance of God's people. Moses parted the Red Sea to save Israel (Exodus 14), Elijah called down fire to affirm the true God (1 Kings 18), and Elisha raised a child from the dead (2 Kings 4). These were not acts for spectacle but pivotal moments in redemptive history.In the New Testament, Jesus’ disciples—especially Peter and Paul—continued this prophetic tradition. Peter healed the lame (Acts 3:1–10), and Paul raised the dead (Acts 20:7–12), but always to authenticate the Gospel.4. Muhammad's Claimed Miracles: Lack of Historical and Theological SubstanceIslamic tradition attributes various miracles to Muhammad, such as water flowing from his fingers, trees weeping, and the alleged splitting of the moon (Sahih Bukhari 4.56.831; Qur’an 54:1). Yet these claims are conspicuously absent in the Qur’an itself, which presents Muhammad primarily as a \"warner\" (Qur’an 88:21) and not as a miracle-worker.The lunar splitting miracle (Qur’an 54:1–2), interpreted by some Muslims as literal, lacks external historical confirmation, especially from civilizations such as the Romans, Persians, or Chinese, who meticulously recorded astronomical events. Furthermore, many of Muhammad’s miracles—like riding the Buraq to Jerusalem (Isra and Mi’raj)—are unverifiable visionary experiences (Qur’an 17:1) rather than witnessed, public signs.Unlike Jesus, Muhammad did not perform any miracle to heal the sick, restore sight to the blind, or raise the dead. Even Muslim scholars like Al-Ghazali acknowledged the Qur’an itself as Muhammad’s primary \"miracle\" (i’jaz), making his signs more literary than supernatural.5. Moral Contrasts and Prophetic IntegrityProphetic integrity involves not only public works but private character. Jesus lived a sinless life (Hebrews 4:15), called others to humility (Matthew 5–7), and demonstrated sacrificial love. In contrast, Muhammad’s life raises ethical questions: multiple wives (Qur’an 33:50), including a marriage to a minor (Sahih Bukhari 5.58.234), and controversial political and military actions (Ibn Ishaq,Sirat Rasul Allah).Christian theology holds that prophets do not merely speak God's Word but embody it (John 1:14). Therefore, when prophetic character contradicts divine holiness, the authenticity of the messenger is called into question.ConclusionThis comparative study illustrates that the miracles of Jesus Christ, rooted in love and historical testimony, stand in stark contrast to the often unverifiable and theatrically styled miracles attributed to Muhammad. Moreover, Jesus' actions consistently reflected divine compassion and moral perfection, qualities essential to true prophetic identity. The apocryphal distortions of Jesus as a magician—and the adoption of such tales into the Qur'an—only serve to emphasize the distance between biblical theology and later religious innovations. Real prophets, as shown in Scripture, act not to impress but to serve.ReferencesEhrman, B. D. (2003).Lost Scriptures: Books that Did Not Make It into the New Testament.

    "full_content": "Temporary Marriage in Early Islam: A Critical Analysis of Sahih al-Bukhari 4615By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaAbstractThis paper examines the controversial hadith narrated inSahih al-Bukhari 4615, which recounts the Prophet Muhammad’s (ﷺ) permission for his companions to engage in temporary marriages during military campaigns. By analyzing the historical, theological, and ethical implications of this practice, the study argues that such acts closely align with the modern definition of prostitution. This raises critical questions regarding the moral consistency of Islamic teachings, especially in comparison with biblical and universal ethical frameworks.1. IntroductionThe canonical hadith collections of Sunni Islam are widely considered by Muslims as authentic historical records of the sayings and actions of Prophet Muhammad. Among them,Sahih al-Bukhariholds the highest authority after the Qur’an. However, certain narrations within it raise profound moral and theological questions. One such narration,Hadith 4615, describes the Prophet’s companions requesting permission for castration to avoid sexual temptation during military expeditions, only for Muhammad to instead allow them to marry women temporarily—even for as little as the price of a garment.This study seeks to critically examine the implications of this narration, arguing that the practice sanctioned therein mirrors prostitution by definition and undermines the ethical claims of Islamic moral superiority.2. Textual Background of Sahih al-Bukhari 4615The hadith reads:“Narrated `Abdullah: We used to participate in the holy wars carried on by the Prophet (ﷺ) and we had no women (wives) with us. So we said (to the Prophet (ﷺ)), ‘Shall we castrate ourselves?’ But the Prophet (ﷺ) forbade us to do that and thenceforth he allowed us to marry a woman (temporarily) by giving her even a garment, and then he recited: ‘O you who believe! Do not make unlawful the good things which Allah has made lawful for you.’”(Sahih al-Bukhari 4615, Vol. 6, Book 60, Hadith 139)This hadith explicitly acknowledges that Muhammad sanctioned temporary unions, later referred to asMutʿah. Such unions were short-term contractual arrangements with women, involving financial or material compensation in exchange for sexual access.3. Mutʿah and the Question of ProstitutionFrom a sociological and ethical standpoint, prostitution is defined asthe exchange of sexual services for material compensation without intent of a lifelong marital commitment. The narration in question meets these criteria:Temporary arrangement: The union lasted only for the duration of need, such as during military campaigns.Compensation: The hadith specifies that even a garment was sufficient as payment.Lack of permanence: Unlike traditional marriage, these unions did not involve lifelong commitment, family establishment, or enduring responsibility.Thus, despite being couched in religious terminology, the practice reflects institutionalized prostitution.4. Theological and Ethical TensionsThe Qur’an itself presents marriage as a solemn covenant (mithaqan ghalidhan, Qur’an 4:21), rooted in permanence, fidelity, and mutual responsibility. By contrast,Mutʿahundermines this vision by reducing women to objects of temporary sexual gratification.Moreover, Muhammad’s prohibition of castration in favor of temporary marriage raises serious theological questions: Was sexual restraint impossible without institutionalized prostitution? Did divine morality prioritize male satisfaction over female dignity?Christian ethics, in contrast, emphasize chastity, self-control, and marriage as a lifelong covenant (Matthew 19:6; 1 Corinthians 7:2). The divergence highlights significant moral inconsistencies between Islamic and biblical frameworks.5. Historical Interpretations and Sunni-Shi’a DivideWhile Sunni Islam eventually prohibitedMutʿah, Shi’a Islam continues to permit it to this day, citing the very hadith in Bukhari and other canonical sources. Sunni apologetics often claim that Muhammad later abrogated the practice. However, the historical record reveals confusion and contradiction, as some companions—including Ibn Abbas—continued to defend its permissibility after Muhammad’s death.The persistence ofMutʿahin Shi’a tradition further illustrates the moral ambiguity of its origins. If the Prophet truly sanctioned prostitution-like arrangements, questions arise regarding his role as a “perfect moral example” (Qur’an 33:21).6. Ethical Implications for WomenTemporary marriage reduces women to disposable objects, legitimizing exploitation under a veneer of religious law. In wartime contexts, where vulnerable women were already displaced or enslaved, this practice risked institutionalizing abuse. The material exchange (“even a garment”) underscores the transactional nature of the act, stripping it of genuine relational or spiritual significance.7. ConclusionThe narration inSahih al-Bukhari 4615raises profound moral, theological, and historical questions about the foundations of Islamic sexual ethics. By sanctioning temporary sexual unions, Muhammad blurred the line between legitimate marriage and prostitution. From a critical academic perspective, this practice stands in tension with universal moral principles of dignity, fidelity, and responsibility.Thus, while Muslims holdSahih al-Bukharias sacred history, this hadith challenges the claim of Muhammad as the ultimate moral exemplar and invites deeper comparative theological reflection.ReferencesAl-Bukhari, Muhammad ibn Ismail.Sahih al-Bukhari, Hadith 4615.Qur’an 4:21, Qur’an 33:21.Cook, D.Muslim Apocalypticism.

What they imply is that the Qur’an today is a trustworthy word of God while the Bible is not. The Bible indeed has many textual variants with minor differences, but evidence of doctrinal corruption is extremely weak. The Qur’an, however, contains far stronger evidence of corruption—according to Ubai, abrogated verses, ‘Uthman’s recension, and other Qur’anic problems. Yet the greatest doctrinal corruption in the Qur’an, introduced by Muslims themselves, is “the daughters of Allah.”SummaryThe Christian websiteanswering-islam.orgsays:“One of the most embarrassing incidents in Muhammad’s life occurred when Satan put his words into Muhammad’s mouth. Muhammad spoke Satan’s words as if they were God’s words. This event is documented in writing by several early Muslim authors and is mentioned in both the Hadith and the Qur’an. Later Muslims, ashamed that their self-proclaimed prophet had uttered the words of Satan, denied that this ever happened. Countless excuses and denials were offered by later Muslims to cover over Muhammad’s sinful error.”It is important to understand that the incident of the “Satanic Verses” was not invented by non-Muslims. It is recorded in the earliest Islamic sources that existed during Muhammad’s lifetime. No one should think this story was fabricated by opponents of Islam. It is an account found directly in the earliest Islamic records.This remains one of the most controversial subjects in Islam: Satan caused Muhammad to speak his (Satan’s) words as if they were God’s.What Did the Qur’an Originally Say?Surah al-Najm (Chapter 53), verses 19–20 says:“Have you considered al-Lat and al-‘Uzza, and the third one, Manat?”Allah was already known in Arabia before Islam as a god with three daughters: al-Lat, al-‘Uzza, and Manat. (Note: “al-” means “the.”)Four early biographers of Muhammad wrote that originally these verses were followed by:“These are the exalted cranes (intercessors) whose prayers are to be hoped for.”Meaning:The daughters of Allah were thought to be heavenly beings who could intercede on behalf of others. The “lofty cranes” were their metaphor. The alternative wording for “to be hoped for” (turtaja) is “approved and confirmed” (turtada). (From Alfred Guillaume’s translation ofThe Life of Muhammadby Ibn Ishaq, p. 166.)Later, this passage was removed and replaced with what we read today:“What! For you the male, and for Him the female? That, then, is an unfair division.” (Qur’an 53:21–22)Meaning:Those who believed Allah had three daughters were treating Allah unjustly, since they preferred sons for themselves yet ascribed only daughters to Him.These are what came to be known as the“Satanic Verses.”In modern times, Salman Rushdie used the phrase only as the title of his fictional novel, but the Qur’an itself refers to the original event. The historical question remains: how can anyone, Muslim or non-Muslim, know what the original verses were? The rest of this document presents both direct and indirect evidence that the Satanic Verses were original, alongside nine major Islamic objections and replies.Evidence that the Satanic Verses Were Original1. From the Qur’an ItselfSurah al-Hajj (22:52) says:“We never sent a messenger or prophet before you, but when he desired, Satan threw (words) into his recitation. But Allah abolishes what Satan throws in, then Allah establishes His verses; Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.”This verse openly admits that Satan influenced prophets, including Muhammad, by inserting words into their recitation. The verse then claims Allah cancels Satan’s additions. But if Satan could truly inspire Muhammad’s speech, it raises the question: how can one be sure which verses in the Qur’an are from Allah and which were not?2. From the HadithSeveral Hadith collections, though not included in the later “canonical six,” preserve the incident. Early narrators did not shy away from reporting it. The embarrassment only arose later when Muslims wanted to defend Muhammad’s infallibility (ismah).3. From Early BiographersThe earliest Islamic historians confirm it:Ibn Ishaq (d. 768 CE), author ofSirat Rasul Allah, the earliest biography of Muhammad, includes it.al-Waqidi (d. 822 CE)and his studentIbn Sa’d (d. 844 CE)both mention it.al-Tabari (d. 923 CE)in hisTarikh al-Rusul wa al-Muluk(“History of the Prophets and Kings”) also records it.These are among the most respected authorities in early Islam. Their inclusion shows the story was widely accepted before later Muslims tried to suppress it.4. From Non-Muslim SourcesChristian and other writers living during Muhammad’s era and shortly after also referred to this event, showing that the story was not just an internal Islamic tradition but something known broadly at the time.Islamic Objections and RepliesOver time, Muslims who were uncomfortable with the idea of Muhammad speaking Satan’s words raised objections. Here are the main ones, with replies:Objection:The isnad (chain of narration) is weak.Reply:Multiple early sources with different isnads preserve the same account. When numerous independent chains exist, weakness in one does not invalidate the whole.Objection:Allah promised to protect the Qur’an (15:9).Reply:This verse was likely added later, after the scandal of the Satanic Verses, as a theological correction. Surah 22:52, by contrast, proves that Satan did interfere.Objection:Prophets are infallible.Reply:Infallibility (ismah) was a later doctrine. Early Muslims had no problem recording Muhammad’s mistakes — even major ones like this.Objection:The verses are not in the Qur’an today.Reply:Precisely because they were removed. The question is not whether they remain, but why early sources unanimously testify they were once there.Objection:The story insults Muhammad.Reply:Historical truth is not judged by whether it flatters someone. If multiple early sources — Muslim and non-Muslim — attest to an event, historians must consider it seriously.More Islamic Objections and RepliesObjection:The wording “exalted cranes” (gharaniq) is strange and un-Qur’anic.Reply:The Qur’an itself has many unique words. “Gharaniq” was a common Arabic metaphor for high, noble beings like birds soaring in the heavens. It fits the poetic style of Surah 53.Objection:If Muhammad praised idols, why would Quraysh later persecute him?Reply:The historical record shows that after Muhammad recited the Satanic Verses, the Quraysh were pleased and even joined him in worship. Only after he retracted and condemned the idols did hostility resume. This sequence explains the otherwise puzzling shift in Quraysh’s attitude.Objection:The verses contradict Islamic monotheism (tawhid).Reply:Exactly. That is why they were later removed. But their presence in the earliest sources shows that Muhammad at one point allowed polytheistic compromise, then reversed course.Objection:Later Muslims unanimously rejected the story.Reply:This proves the embarrassment, not the falsity. Early Muslims accepted it; later Muslims tried to erase it to protect Muhammad’s reputation. Suppression is not evidence of truth but of shame.Objection:Satan cannot overpower a prophet.Reply:The Qur’an itself (22:52) says otherwise — Satan does put words into prophets’ mouths, which Allah then cancels. This verse would make little sense unless such an event had actually occurred.Theological Significance of “The Daughters of Allah”The Satanic Verses expose a major doctrinal problem: Muhammad once allowed the worship of Allah’s “daughters” — al-Lat, al-‘Uzza, and Manat — as legitimate intercessors. These were not just tribal goddesses; they were revered across Arabia. By affirming them, even briefly, Muhammad compromised the central doctrine of Islam:tawhid(absolute oneness of God).Later Muslims tried to erase this by:Removing the verses from the Qur’an.Replacing them with condemnation of ascribing daughters to Allah.Developing doctrines of prophetic infallibility.Reinterpreting history to claim the event never happened.But the earliest Islamic records remain stubborn evidence that the verses were real.ConclusionThe story of “the daughters of Allah” — the Satanic Verses — is not a fabrication of Islam’s critics but an event preserved by the earliest Muslim historians, confirmed by the Qur’an (22:52), and remembered even outside Islamic circles. It reveals that Muhammad once spoke words inspired not by God but by Satan, then later reversed himself.For Christians, this raises an unavoidable question: if Satan could inspire part of the Qur’an, how can any Muslim know which verses are truly from God? By contrast, the Bible has stood the test of history with integrity and transparency, despite minor textual variations, and it never compromises the nature of God.The incident remains one of the most damaging proofs that the Qur’an is not the infallible word of God but a human book — subject to error, revision, and satanic influence.",

    "full_content": "Apostle Paul vs. Muhammad: Who Stands as the True Messenger?By Dr. Maxwell Shimba | Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionMuslims often accuse the Apostle Paul of being a false apostle, a corrupter of Scripture, and even claim he was the one who first called Jesus “God” and established Christianity as we know it today. These are serious allegations that warrant a careful, scriptural response. In this study, we shall weigh the lives, callings, teachings, and spiritual fruit of both Paul and Muhammad by the standards of divine revelation. Who truly stands as a legitimate apostle of God?1. The Birth and Heritage of Paul and MuhammadPaul’s Birth and HeritagePaul declares in Acts 22:3,“I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia…”Tarsus was a significant city under Roman rule, famous for its intellectual culture and skilled artisans. As such, Paul was born not only into Jewish nobility but was also a Roman citizen by birth (Acts 22:25-28). Paul traces his lineage to the noble tribe of Benjamin, making him a true descendant of Abraham—the patriarch through whom all nations were to be blessed (Genesis 12:1-4; 22:15-18, Romans 11:1). Paul himself describes his credentials:“…circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; in regard to the law, a Pharisee.” (Philippians 3:4-5)Muhammad’s Birth and HeritageMuhammad was born in 570 AD in Mecca, in the Arabian Peninsula. The Qur’an (41:44) acknowledges his Arab descent. According to Qur’an 34:44, no scripture or prophetic warning had ever been given to his people before him, meaning both Muhammad and his Arab contemporaries were born into spiritual ignorance, with no revealed book or knowledge of the true God. Islamic tradition records that pre-Islamic Arabs worshipped many idols and even objects such as attractive loaves of bread.Theological Reflection:Paul was born into a lineage of God’s covenant people, trained in the knowledge and worship of the one true God. In contrast, Muhammad emerged from a people who had neither knowledge of God nor His revelation.2. The Education of Paul and MuhammadPaul’s EducationPaul testifies,“I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city [Jerusalem]. I studied under Gamaliel and was thoroughly trained in the law of our ancestors.” (Acts 22:3)Gamaliel was one of the most respected teachers of Jewish law (Acts 5:34). Paul excelled above his peers in zeal and knowledge (Galatians 1:14) and went on to author thirteen epistles by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit (Galatians 6:11; 2 Peter 3:15-17).Muhammad’s EducationThe Qur’an itself acknowledges that Muhammad was “unlettered” (Qur’an 7:157, 62:2), unable to read or write. Islamic sources confirm that neither Muhammad nor his tribe, the Quraysh, were educated in reading or writing.His lack of formal knowledge led to teachings that diverge from common sense and sound doctrine, such as the recommendation to use dust for ritual purification (Qur’an 5:6) or the infamous hadith instructing followers to fully submerge a fly in a drink, asserting that one wing carries disease and the other cure (Mishkat al-Masabih, vol. 2, p. 152).Theological Reflection:Whereas Paul was equipped with both spiritual and academic formation, Muhammad’s lack of knowledge is not presented in the Qur’an as a sign of humility, but as a limitation—contrary to biblical standards for prophetic leadership (Ezekiel 13:3).3. The Faith of Paul and MuhammadPaul’s FaithPaul was raised as a devout Jew, strictly adhering to the Law and the prophets before his conversion (Galatians 1:13; Acts 26:4-5). Even after his encounter with Christ, he continued teaching from the Law and the Prophets to prove Jesus is the Messiah (Acts 28:23).Muhammad’s FaithBefore Islam, Muhammad was a pagan among the Quraysh, worshipping the 360 idols of the Kaaba, including the black stone and deities like al-Lat, al-Uzza, and Manat (Qur’an 53:16-23).Theological Reflection:Paul’s faith was rooted in the progressive revelation of the one true God; Muhammad’s was rooted in polytheistic traditions before claiming prophetic status.4. The Calling to ApostleshipPaul’s CallingPaul was directly commissioned by the risen Jesus Christ on the road to Damascus (Acts 9:1-8). Christ’s command was later confirmed to Ananias in a vision (Acts 9:11-15), and Paul’s apostleship was validated by his preaching before nations and kings (Galatians 1:17; Acts 9:19-20, 17:16-22, 18:19, 28:16-30; Romans 15:24-28).Muhammad’s CallingAccording to early Islamic biographies, Muhammad received his calling through a mysterious encounter in a cave, where an unknown being (later identified as Gabriel) commanded him to “read.” Terrified, Muhammad returned home trembling and feared he was possessed or bewitched. His wife Khadijah and her cousin Waraqa bin Nawfal reassured him that he was a prophet, essentially bestowing the prophetic title upon him. There is no direct divine commissioning as seen with biblical prophets, and Muhammad himself doubted the nature of his experience.Theological Reflection:True prophetic calls in Scripture are direct, clear, and bring assurance, not confusion or terror. God forbids divination and fortune-telling (Deuteronomy 18:10-12), practices that surround Muhammad’s alleged calling.5. Signs and MiraclesPaul’s Miracles“God did extraordinary miracles through Paul, so that even handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched him were taken to the sick, and their illnesses were cured and the evil spirits left them.” (Acts 19:11-12)Muhammad and MiraclesThe Qur’an explicitly denies that Muhammad performed miracles, instead claiming that miracles belong to Allah alone and are given at His discretion (Qur’an 29:50). Islamic sources further report that Muhammad was himself afflicted by sorcery (Bukhari, Sahih Muslim).Theological Reflection:Biblical prophets are validated by signs and wonders; Muhammad performed none, and even suffered affliction by sorcery—contrary to the pattern of God’s messengers.6. Reception of Revelations (Visions/Wahy)PaulPaul received clear visions and direct messages from the Lord (Acts 16:9-10, 18:9, 26:19).MuhammadMuhammad described his experiences of “wahy” (revelation) as physically distressing, often likening them to the ringing of bells, leaving him disoriented (see Islamic sources).7. The Danger of Rejecting the Apostle PaulPeter warns,“Bear in mind that our Lord’s patience means salvation, just as our dear brother Paul also wrote you with the wisdom that God gave him. He writes the same way in all his letters… His letters contain some things that are hard to understand, which ignorant and unstable people distort, as they do the other Scriptures, to their own destruction…” (2 Peter 3:15-18).Rejecting Paul’s apostleship and gospel is tantamount to rejecting the very foundation of salvation in Christ, bringing condemnation (Romans 2:16).ConclusionThose who deny the apostleship of Paul and the gospel he preached are described by Scripture as ignorant, unstable, and doomed to judgment. In every measure—heritage, education, faith, divine calling, miracles, revelation—Paul stands as a true apostle, whereas Muhammad’s claim is undermined by history and theology alike.Come to Jesus, the true Savior!Muhammad is found wanting before Paul.It is all bluster—nothing more.Shalom.For further studies, visit Shimba Theological Institute or contact Dr. Maxwell Shimba.",

The Qur’an, in Surah al-Ma’idah 5:116, accuses Christians of worshiping a trinity ofAllah, Jesus, and Mary. It claims that our Lord Jesus told people to take His mother as a deity. Let me say it clearly:this is a lie from the pit of hell!No Christian in history, no Church Father, no council, no denomination—Orthodox, Catholic, or Protestant—has ever declared Mary as God. She is blessed among women, yes; she is the mother of our Lord in His humanity, yes; but she is a servant of God, not part of the Godhead.The True TrinityThe Bible is clear:One God in three persons — Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.Jesus commanded baptism“in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit”(Matthew 28:19).Paul blessed the Church with“the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit”(2 Corinthians 13:14).Mary’s name is never in this divine formula. The Trinity is eternal, holy, and perfect — and Mary is a created being redeemed by her own Son.The Qur’an’s ErrorNow, if the Qur’an truly came from God, it could not misrepresent the faith of Christians. God is all-knowing. God is truth. God cannot lie.But the Qur’an does lie. It puts words in the mouth of Jesus that He never spoke. It fabricates a false trinity. And by doing so, it exposes itself asa counterfeit revelation.This means that Allah, the god of the Qur’an, is not the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The god of the Qur’an is a deceiver. And Muhammad, who spread this deception, is not a prophet of God but afalse prophet—for the Bible says in Deuteronomy 18:20:“But the prophet who presumes to speak a word in my name that I have not commanded him to speak…that prophet shall die.”The Call to TruthChurch, the truth remains unshaken:God the Father— the Creator of heaven and earth.God the Son— Jesus Christ, eternal Word made flesh, our Savior and Redeemer.God the Holy Spirit— the Comforter, our Guide, our Seal of salvation.This is the holy Trinity, the true God, revealed in Scripture, worshiped by the Church, and confessed by the saints throughout the ages.Therefore, let us boldly proclaim: The Qur’an is false. Muhammad is not a prophet. And Allah is not the true God. The living God is revealed in Jesus Christ our Lord — the same yesterday, today, and forever.Conclusion & ProclamationBrothers and sisters, lift your voices in faith:We do not worship Mary.We do not worship a false trinity.We worship the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit — one God in three persons, blessed forever.Let the world hear it:“Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is One”(Deuteronomy 6:4), and that one Lord has revealed Himself fully in Jesus Christ.Amen and Amen!",

To claim otherwise is to misrepresent two thousand years of Christian faith.Now, here is the problem for Islam: If Allah is truly God, He should know what Christians believe. If the Qur’an is truly revelation, it should represent the Christian doctrine truthfully. But the Qur’an does not. It fabricates a false trinity and puts false words in the mouth of Jesus. That is not divine revelation; that iserror.And if the Qur’an contains error, then Allah is not all-knowing, and Muhammad is not a prophet of the true God. By contrast, the Bible tells us that God cannot lie (Titus 1:2), His Word is truth (John 17:17), and His revelation is perfect (Psalm 19:7).Therefore, the conclusion is unavoidable:The Qur’an is false, Muhammad is a false prophet, and Allah is not the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.But there is good news. The true God has revealed Himself in Jesus Christ, the eternal Word made flesh, who died for our sins and rose again. He is alive, He reigns, and He saves all who call upon His name.So I leave you with a challenge:Follow the book that misrepresents history, or follow the Savior who conquered death.Trust in a prophet who lied, or trust in the Son of God who is the Truth.As for me, I will stand with the Triune God — Father, Son, and Holy Spirit — the only true and living God, forever praised.Thank you.",

    "full_content": "A Critical Analysis of Qur’an 21:107:\"We have not sent you (O Muhammad) except as a mercy to all the worlds\"IntroductionThe Qur’an makes a striking claim in Surah al-Anbiyā’ 21:107:“And We have not sent you, [O Muhammad], except as a mercy to the worlds (لِّـلْعٰلَمِيْنَ).”Muslim tradition interprets this verse as affirming Muhammad’s universal mission and his embodiment of divine mercy. However, when critically examined in light of historical evidence, linguistic analysis, and theological comparison with Biblical revelation, several issues arise. The verse reveals inconsistencies in the Qur’an’s presentation of Muhammad, raises questions about the meaning of “mercy,” and introduces the problematic term‘worlds’(plural), which lacks scriptural or historical coherence.1. The Concept of “Mercy” in Qur’an 21:107In Islamic exegesis (tafsīr), the Arabic termraḥmah(mercy) is often interpreted as divine compassion manifested through Muhammad’s mission. Classical commentators like al-Ṭabarī (d. 923) and Ibn Kathīr (d. 1373) describe this mercy as Muhammad’s role in guiding humanity to Islam, thereby saving them from eternal punishment. However, this interpretation is inconsistent with historical evidence.Historical Violence: The biography of Muhammad (sīrah) andhadithliterature record numerous acts of warfare, executions, and forced conversions (see Ibn Hishām,Sīrat Rasūl Allāh; al-Bukhārī,Ṣaḥīḥ). These raise the question: in what sense can such actions be defined as “mercy”?Contrast with Jesus Christ: In Christian theology, Jesus embodies mercy through sacrificial love and forgiveness (John 3:16; Matthew 5:44). Unlike Muhammad, Jesus never employed violence as a means of spreading faith.Thus, the Qur’anic claim that Muhammad was “mercy” requires scrutiny when juxtaposed with historical accounts of his actions.2. The Plural “Worlds” (لِّـلْعٰلَمِيْنَ)The Qur’an frequently refers to God as “Lord of the worlds” (Rabb al-‘Ālamīn) (Qur’an 1:2). However, this raises critical issues:Ambiguity of “Worlds”: In both Hebrew (olam) and Greek (kosmos) biblical texts, the world is consistently singular in reference to creation. The idea of multiple “worlds” is absent in the Bible, which speaks of “heaven and earth” (Genesis 1:1) but not “worlds.”Historical Incoherence: Neither Jewish nor Christian Scripture, nor extra-biblical ancient literature, records the existence of multiple “worlds” to which a prophet might be sent. Muhammad himself lived in a geographically limited context in Arabia and never interacted with other “worlds” or civilizations beyond his immediate environment.Later Cosmological Influence: Some Muslim theologians interpret “worlds” as encompassing humans, jinn, angels, and all of creation (al-Rāzī,Mafātīḥ al-Ghayb). However, this is a post-hoc theological rationalization. Historically, Muhammad did not address angels or extraterrestrial beings; his preaching was confined to the Arabian Peninsula.This linguistic and theological vagueness undermines the claim of universal “mercy.”3. Mercy or Terror?The critical question is whether Muhammad’s mission resulted in mercy or coercion.Mercy in the Qur’an?The Qur’an repeatedly commands fighting against non-believers (Qur’an 9:5; 9:29). Far from universal mercy, these verses promote hostility toward Jews, Christians, and polytheists.The Sword versus the Cross: Historical expansion of Islam through jihad contrasts starkly with the New Testament’s call for evangelism through persuasion and love (Matthew 28:19–20).Thus, what the Qur’an frames as “mercy” may in fact be more accurately described as political conquest.ConclusionQur’an 21:107 asserts that Muhammad was sent as a “mercy to the worlds,” yet historical, linguistic, and theological analysis exposes the fragility of this claim. The plural “worlds” has no biblical or historical foundation, and the violent aspects of Muhammad’s mission contradict the very essence of mercy. In contrast, the biblical portrait of Jesus Christ presents true mercy—self-giving love, forgiveness, and redemption for all humanity. Therefore, Qur’an 21:107 serves less as evidence of divine revelation and more as an example of Muhammad’s self-ascribed prophetic authority.References and Bibliographyal-Bukhārī, Muḥammad ibn Ismā‘īl.Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī.

This article evaluates the verse on two fronts: (1) its literary-historical intent and the range of traditional interpretations; and (2) the biological record on “two hearts,” from human anomalies and surgical cases to animals with multiple cardiac pumps. I then pose a series of theological and scientific questions intended to sharpen debate across confessional lines and to clarify what, exactly, the verse is—and is not—asserting.1) Text and Immediate ContextQur’an 33:4 (Al-Aḥzāb)in a widely used modern English rendering reads:“Allah does not place two hearts in any person’s chest; nor does He regard your wives as your mothers [by your saying ‘you are as my mother’s back’], nor your adopted sons as your [biological] sons…” (Quran.com)Classical and modern tafsīr link 33:4–5 to two reforms: (a) invalidatingẓihār(a pre-Islamic formula likening a wife to one’s mother to dissolve marital obligations) and (b) correctingadoption/namingcustoms associated with Zayd ibn Ḥāritha, whose case is further discussed in 33:37. (QuranX,Islam Stack Exchange,Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research)Notably,al-Jalālaynsays the opening clause refutes those who boasted they had “two hearts” (i.e., superior intellect/resolve), situating the line as arhetorical denialrather than a literal foray into anatomy. Maudūdī’sTafhīmlikewise reads it as an emphatic negation placed alongside the reforms of ẓihār and adoption. (QuranX,Surah Quran)2) Linguistic ConsiderationsThe verse says“God has not placed two hearts in any man/person (min rajulin) within his chest.”On its face, it universalizes toany human. Yet in idiomatic Arabic, “two hearts” functioned as afigure of speechfor divided allegiance or an alleged mental superiority. Thus, the line plausibly means:a person cannot be of two minds in ultimate loyalty,dovetailing with the adjoining legal-ethical reforms. This reading is consistent with major tafsīr. (QuranX,Quran.com)Still, because the verse usesconcrete anatomical wording, questions arise aboutscope: Is the statement (a) purely idiomatic; (b) a generalization about natural human anatomy; (c) a theological axiom about undivided devotion; or (d) more than one of these at once?3) Biology: What Do We Know about “Two Hearts”?3.1 HumansNaturally occurring two complete heartsin a single human being (from conception) is not a recognized viable phenotype in medical literature. Congenital anomalies can produce complex hearts (incorrect chambering, duplication of parts, situs disorders), but not a fully duplicated, independent second heart. (Circulation Journals,Translational Pediatrics)Conjoined twinscan present with two hearts within a shared thoracic complex, but that istwo individualsbiologically. (This article focuses on single individuals.)Heterotopic heart transplantation(a “piggy-back” procedure) can result inone patient living with two hearts(the native and the donor heart) functioning simultaneously for years or decades—a medical reality since the late 20th century. Clinicians and case reports explicitly describe “living with two hearts.” (Temple Now,PMC,Oxford Academic)Implication:If 33:4 were read as a strict, timeless anatomical claim, heterotopic transplants form an interesting boundary case:a single person with two functional hearts in one chest by medical intervention.3.2 AnimalsMultiple “hearts” (or heart-like pumps) do occur in other species:Octopuses and squids: typicallythree hearts—one systemic heart and two branchial hearts that pump blood across the gills. (Natural History Museum)Hagfish: one principal heart plus several accessory pumps (some accounts enumerateup to five “hearts”when counting auxiliaries). (The Lancet,Labroots)Earthworms: often misdescribed as having “five hearts,” but these areaortic arches—contractile vessels, not homologous to a vertebrate heart. (CK-12 Foundation,A-Z Animals)Popular science outlets continue to highlight animals with multiple pumping organs, underscoring that “more than one heart” is a real, well-documentednon-humanadaptation. (WorldAtlas,The Times of India)4) Theological Readings and Points of TensionRhetorical/Idiomatic Reading (dominant in tafsīr):The verse negates themetaphorof dual hearts to insist upon undivided loyalty and to anchor legal reforms. On this reading, the statement isnota propositional claim about anatomy, and neither conjoined twins nor heterotopic transplants are relevant. (QuranX,Surah Quran)Literal-Anatomical Reading (minor but possible):If taken as a universal claim aboutcreation, then (a) natural human development indeed does not produce two separate hearts; yet (b) modern surgery can placetwo heartsin one chest with both beating—raising the question whether the verse intended to preclude such a state “for any human”in principle, or speaking ofhow God originally fashions humans(pre-intervention). (PMC)Meta-Ethical Reading (allegiance):The “one heart” motif functions as a theological axiom:God does not design humans to sustain ultimate dual loyalties.This coheres with the immediate legal corrections (ẓihār, adoption naming) as acts that requiredcleavingfalse equivalences (wife ≠ mother; adopted son ≠ biological son) to restore moral clarity. (My Islam)5) A Structured Challenge: Questions for DebateA. Theological QuestionsScope of Universality:Does “any person” (min rajulin) intendall humans across all times and conditions, or onlynatural formationabsent postnatal intervention? How do exegetes justify one scope over the other from the Arabic and the context? (Quran.com)Genre and Intent:If the clause is rhetorical, what markers in 33:4–5 signalmetaphorrather thanempirical claim? How does this affect Muslim claims that Qur’anic statements routinely align with scientific discovery? (QuranX)Coherence with Reforms:In what way does “one heart” theologically underwrite the reforms on ẓihār and adoption—i.e., is the verse primarily aboutmoral non-equivalence(you cannot treat Xas ifY), rather than about biology? (Surah Quran,Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research)Providence and Technology:If God says no person has two hearts, how should a Muslim theologian account forheterotopic transplantsthat produce precisely that state? Is the verse restricted tooriginal creation(fitra), allowing technology to create exceptions, or is ittimeless and exceptionless? (Temple Now,PMC)Hermeneutical Consistency:When should verses be readmetaphoricallyversusliterally? What criteria—language, context, consensus (ijmāʿ), or scientific data—decide the matter?B. Scientific QuestionsDefinitional Rigor:What counts as a “heart”? Vertebrate single pump vs. invertebrate multiple pumps;accessoryvs.principalhearts (e.g., hagfish). How should claims about “two hearts” control forhomologyandfunction? (The Lancet,CK-12 Foundation)Human Boundary Cases:Doconjoined twins(two hearts in shared anatomy) orheterotopic recipientsfalsify a blanket, literal reading? If not, why not? (Temple Now,PMC)Developmental Biology:Are there any documented human cases ofcardiac duplication(a truly second, independent heart) compatible with postnatal life? Current literature points to complex malformations, not full duplication. What would such a case imply for scriptural interpretation? (Circulation Journals)Comparative Physiology:Given that octopuses havethree heartsand hagfish havemultiple pumps, how should theology engagenon-human diversityin God’s creation without retrofitting texts intoscientific concordism? (Natural History Museum,The Lancet)Surgical Theology:Does the success oftwo-heart physiologyin heterotopic transplants suggest that “two hearts” isbiophysically viablefor humans (with assistance), thus challenging readings that treat the state as inherently impossible? (PMC)6) Synthesis and PositionHistorically and exegetically, 33:4 functions as arhetoricalandethicalpivot: “two hearts” negates divided allegiance and undergirds reforms to marriage and adoption practices. This is well attested in classical tafsīr. (QuranX,Surah Quran)Empirically, no naturally developed human is known to possesstwo fully independent hearts; however,medicine can—and does—produce a two-heart statein one chest via heterotopic transplantation, sometimes for decades. Thus, astrictly literal, exceptionlessreading that outlaws the very possibility is difficult to maintain without narrowing the claim tonatural formationonly. (PMC,Temple Now)Comparative biologydemonstrates thatmultiple hearts are a real featureof God’s broader creation (octopus, hagfish, etc.), underscoring that the Qur’anic clause, if read as a universal biological principle, cannot extend beyondhumanswithout qualification. (Natural History Museum,The Lancet)7) ConclusionA careful, scholarly reading suggests Qur’an 33:4 is best understood asrhetorical theologyin service of moral-legal reform, not as a blanket scientific assertion about anatomy. Nevertheless, because the verse usesanatomical language, it invites empirical scrutiny and, with modern cardiothoracic practice, yieldsborderline counterexamples(two hearts in one person post-transplant). Theologically, Muslim scholars can preserve the verse’s integrity by anchoring it inidiom and intention(undivided allegiance, rejection of false equivalences), while acknowledging thatmedical technologycan generate physiological states that the verse wasnotaddressing. From a debate standpoint, the key isclarifying scope and genre—and resisting the urge to stretch the text into a universal scientific maxim.Selected ReferencesQur’an text and translations with notes: Qur’an 33:4–5.

    "full_content": "A Theological Critique of Islamic Revelation: An Academic PerspectiveBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteReligious claims must be evaluated through historical analysis, theological consistency, textual reliability, and the moral fruit they produce. Within Christian scholarship, one of the enduring debates concerns the origin of Muhammad’s revelations and the legitimacy of Islam’s claim to divine authority. This article presents a Christian apologetic argument asserting that the revelations received by Muhammad were not from the God of the Bible and that Christianity alone presents the true and salvific revelation of God.1. The Question of Revelation: Divine or Non-Divine?The central claim of Islam is that Muhammad received revelations directly from Allah through the angel Jibril (Gabriel). However, from a biblical perspective, this claim raises significant theological difficulties. The content of Muhammad’s revelations—particularly their denial of the deity of Christ, the crucifixion, and the Trinity—stands in stark contradiction to the previously revealed Scriptures (Torah, Psalms, and Gospel), which the Qur’an itself acknowledges as divine.According to classical Christian theology, any revelation that contradicts prior revelation from the true God cannot originate from Him. This echoes the apostolic warning:“Even if an angel from heaven should preach a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed.”(Galatians 1:8)Thus, Christian scholars historically concluded that Muhammad’s revelations cannot be considered divine in origin.2. Islam and the Question of PeaceIslam often identifies itself as a religion of peace. However, the historical and textual evidence within the Qur’an and early Islamic tradition reveals a more complex picture. Several passages advocate the use of force in spreading the faith, and Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) historically integrates religious authority with political and military power.By contrast, Jesus Christ preached a message of peace rooted in transformation of the heart, forgiveness of enemies, and the separation of spiritual authority from political coercion:“My kingdom is not of this world.”(John 18:36)Thus, Christian theologians conclude that the ethical framework of Christianity is fundamentally different from that of Islam, particularly on issues of violence, salvation, and human dignity.3. The Exclusive Claim of Christianity: Jesus as the Only WayChristianity stands on the historic and theological foundation thatJesus Christ is the sole and final revelation of God, the fulfillment of all prophecies, and the only mediator between God and humanity. Jesus declared:“I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.”(John 14:6)Unlike the claims surrounding Muhammad, the ministry of Jesus is supported by fulfilled prophecy, miraculous works, eyewitness testimony, and the resurrection—a historical event that no other religion can parallel.Christianity is not merely a belief system; it is the culmination of God’s redemptive plan through Christ. Therefore, any later religious movement that denies the identity and mission of Jesus cannot be considered a continuation of God’s revelation.4. ConclusionFrom a Christian theological standpoint, Islam does not represent a divinely inspired faith. Its teachings conflict with the established revelations of the Bible, its portrayal of Jesus contradicts historical and prophetic truth, and its doctrine deviates from the character of God revealed through Scripture. Christianity—grounded in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ—remains the only true path to salvation.This critique is presented not out of hostility toward Muslims as individuals but out of commitment to biblical truth and sound theological inquiry. The Christian mission remains the proclamation of Christ’s saving grace to all peoples, including those within the Islamic world.",

    "full_content": "THREE (3) REASONS WHY MUHAMMAD IS NOT A PROPHETBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteThe source of a matter is its beginning and its foundation. Roots are always underground; for this reason, people often ignore what is hidden below and only focus on what appears above the ground. A person suffering from a toothache needs to know the cause—the root of the tooth. If the root has decayed, it must be examined, or else the whole tooth will remain painful. The root of the tooth cannot be seen, yet you know it is there because the pain is severe.The world today is in pain, and that pain will not end until we understand the source. If I simply believe something without investigating its origin, I will remain with lifelong pain. Because faith is central to human life, I must carefully examine whether the source of Muhammad's message is true. Does he have the qualities of a prophet? Do his actions prove that he is truly a prophet? Does Muhammad possess power like the other prophets? These are many questions, but they are important in order to believe what is right.If I believe without knowing the source, I remain with permanent pain.I have three important reasons that make me question whether Muhammad is truly a prophet. Why do such things exist in his story? Is the source of the matter genuinely divine, or is there something behind it? Can I trust a foundation filled with contradictions?1. WHY DID MUHAMMAD NOT STRIKE THE ANGEL—AS PROPHET MOSES DID?Bukhari, Muslim, and others narrate:It is reported from Azzuhry, through ‘Urwah ibn Zubair, from Aisha (the wife of Muhammad), that Angel Jibreel came to Muhammad in the cave of Hira and told him, “Read.”Muhammad replied, “I do not know how to read.”Muhammad said the angel then seized him tightly until he was overwhelmed. The angel again commanded, “Read.”Muhammad repeated, “I do not know how to read.”The angel squeezed him again with great force and said, “Read in the name of your Lord who created—created man from a clot of blood. Read, and your Lord is the Most Generous.”(Qur’an 96:1–3)After this, Muhammad returned to his wife Khadija trembling with great fear. When he entered, he threw himself down saying, “Cover me! Cover me!”When he calmed down he said, “I am afraid—something terrible may happen to me!”Khadija comforted him saying: “No! By Allah, God will never disgrace you…”But compare this with another narration:Sahih Bukhari Hadith 1339shows the Angel of Death complaining to Allah:“You sent me to a servant who does not want to die.”Abu Huraira narrates that Allah sent the Angel of Death to take the soul of Moses. Moses struck him with a blow that knocked out his eye! The angel returned to Allah saying, “You sent me to Your servant who does not want to die; he struck me and removed my eye.” Allah restored his eye…(References: Sahih Bukhari 1339; Sahih Muslim; Musnad Ahmad; Al-Musannaf; Sunan An-Nasa’i; Al-Bidaya wan-Nihaya; Tarikh At-Tabari)These accounts contradict each other, but the question remains:Why did Jibreel seize and squeeze Muhammad until he nearly fainted?Why did Muhammad only agree to “read” after being violently pressed the third time?Why didn’t he accept the command the first time—before the suffering?And why did he return home trembling in great fear?Was Muhammad unable to strike the angel as Moses did?Moses removed the eye of the Angel of Death, yet Muhammad was powerless before Jibreel?It is impossible that a true prophet would be weaker than Moses, who defeated an angel with a single blow.2. HIS PROPHETHOOD WAS CONFIRMED BY A SORCERER (WITCH-DOCTOR)Khadija once consulted a traditional healer (a sorcerer) who had given her a piece of paper to bring to Muhammad. The healer claimed that if Muhammad’s strange condition was caused by madness, he would be healed.When Khadija returned home, she found Muhammad reciting the Qur’an. She took him to the sorcerer, who examined Muhammad and uncovered his back. He then saw the so-called “seal of prophethood” between his shoulders.(References: Tarikh al-Khamis; Al-Sira al-Halabiyya; Al-Sira al-Nabawiyya)If asorcerer—who has no power from God—is the one confirming Muhammad’s prophethood, can such a testimony be trusted?How can Jibreel and a witch-doctor lead to the same conclusion?What spirit was truly involved?3. MUHAMMAD ATTEMPTED TO COMMIT SUICIDEMuhammad himself confessed that during those experiences he climbed to the top of a high mountain intending to throw himself off and die.(Reference: Al-Musannaf J.5 p.323)I have deeply reflected on this:What secret was Muhammad hiding that drove him to such an extreme step?Why would he want to kill himself if the message truly came from the real God?Would a true prophet attempt suicide?This forces me to examine what Muhammad saw in that cave.Waraqa bin Nawfal told Khadija:“Ask Muhammad who is coming to him—if it is the angel Mikael, then he brings peace. But if it is Jibreel, then he brings war and captivity.”When Khadija asked Muhammad, he answered, “It is Jibreel.”Khadija then struck her own face in distress.(Reference: Tarikh al-Ya’qubi)Why did Khadija strike her face after learning it was Jibreel who had seized Muhammad?With all this evidence, can anyone still claim that Muhammad’s revelations came from the true God?**Think.Examine.Seek the truth.Come to Jesus.**",

However, as I was reading the Qur’an, I was astonished to discover that Allah speaks harshly and disgracefully to Muhammad, His so-called messenger. The Qur’an itself contains verses where Allah rebukes Muhammad openly and uses embarrassing language against him, as shown in the following passages:“You, Muhammad, will die, and your people will also die.”Surah Az-Zumar 39:30“Then on the Day of Resurrection, you will dispute before your Lord.”(Again affirming Muhammad’s mortality)Surah Az-Zumar 39:31“Say, ‘I am only a human being like you.’”Surah Al-Kahf 18:110“Ask forgiveness for your sin and for the believing men and believing women.”The Qur’an never states that Muhammad or his followers were forgiven.Surah Muhammad 47:19“You cannot guide whom you love.”Surah Al-Qasas 28:56“Even if you ask forgiveness for them seventy times, Allah will never forgive them.”Surah At-Tawbah 9:80“Why has no angel been sent down to us? Why do we not see the angels?”The Qur’an never shows Muhammad presenting an angel as proof.Surah Al-Hijr 15:6–7“O People of the Book, you are on nothing until you uphold the Torah and the Gospel…”Allah confirms that the Jews and Christians must follow their Scriptures, not Islam.Surah Al-Ma’idah 5:68“What kind of messenger is this, who eats food and walks in the markets?Why was an angel not sent down with him? Is he bewitched?”Surah Al-Furqan 25:7–8“There is none of you who will not pass over Hell; this is an irrevocable decree.”Surah Maryam 19:71“Then We will save those who feared Allah and leave the wrongdoers within it.”Surah Maryam 19:72Critical Questions1. Who are the ones saying “We will save those who fear Allah”?Muslims believe only Allah saves. Why then does Allah speak as if others share this role?2. Why does Allah send His believers into Hell—both the righteous and the sinners?If all Muslims must enter Hell first, does this not prove there is no true Islamic Heaven except Hell itself, a place entered by believers and evildoers alike?3. Why does Allah use offensive and humiliating words toward His own messenger?This is a serious theological contradiction.Throughout the Qur’an, Allah praises Isa (Jesus) far more than Muhammad. Yet the same Qur’an records Allah speaking harshly, humiliatingly, and offensively to Muhammad.In contrast, the God of the Bibleneverspeaks disgracefully about Jesus Christ.The Qur’an’s portrayal of Allah belittling Muhammad is deeply embarrassing for the Muslim community.Why does Allah disgrace Muhammad in this manner?Reflect.Question everything.Take action.—Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

Go to your fields however you wish.”What the Bible Teaches About WomenThe Bible uplifts women with honor:“He who finds a wife finds a good thing and obtains favor from the LORD.” (Proverbs 18:22)Women are allowed to preach and minister (1 Corinthians 11:1–5).Jesus commissioned a woman—Mary Magdalene—as the first witness of His resurrection (John 20:16–18).The Contradiction of Islamic Punishment for AdulteryThe punishment for adultery in Islam has two conflicting laws:1. Qur’anic LawSurah An-Nur 24:2commands:“Flog both the male and the female adulterer with 100 lashes, in the presence of the believers.”The Qur’an givesthe same punishmentfor:married adulterersunmarried adulterersBut:2. Hadith Law (Muhammad’s Law)The Hadith—Sahih al-BukhariBook 8, No. 805—teachesstoning to deathfor adulterers.Most Qur’an translations avoid the word “stoning” becauseit is not found anywhere in the Arabic Qur’an, the original language. It only appears in Hadith.So which is stronger?Allah’s law in the Qur’an?Or Muhammad’s law in the Hadith?Why did Muhammad’s law override Allah’s law?Why did the 100-lashes punishment get replaced by stoning?These contradictions expose a system that punishes women far more severely.Islam Allows Female Genital Mutilation (FGM)While many nations fight against FGM, Islamic nations continue the practice.According to Muhammad in:Sunan Abu DawudBook 41, Hadith 5251Ahmad ibn Hanbal 5:75Abu Dawud Adab 167Circumcision of women is described as an “honor.”InJuly 2014, the newly formed Islamic State in Iraq ordered thatall women aged 11 to 46 must be circumcisedaccording to Islamic Sharia.To this day, the Islamic State has never denied or reversed this order, nor has any major Islamic authority condemned it.The Islamic Heaven (Jannah)The Islamic idea of paradise stands in complete contrast to the Christian Heaven.Surah Al-Waqi’ah 56:10–40describes Jannah as a place where:Muslim men drink wineenjoy fruits like bananaseat birdsand receive virgins with special physical featuresNothing in these verses explains whatMuslim womenwill enjoy in paradise.Surah Az-Zukhruf 43:70says that men will enter paradisewith their wives.So what happens to:Muslim women who were never married?Married Muslim women whose husbands receive heavenly virgins?Women who lost their husbands?Widows?Divorced women?And another disturbing contradiction:Surah Maryam 19:71–72says thatevery Muslim, including Muhammad, must pass through Hell.So how can Muslims go to Jannahwith their wives, when Allah has already decreed that all of them—including Muhammad—must first enter Hell?The Hadith adds even more confusion.Riyadh as-SalihinNo. 1859 says that one of the rivers of paradise flows out of Muhammad’s house—yet Islamic theology teaches that Allah hasno likeness or partner(Surah 112:4).In contrast:The Bible teaches that Heaven is for both men and women equally.Matthew 22:30John 14:1–31 Thessalonians 4The Christian Heaven is holy, eternal, and centered on God’s presence—not sensual reward.My Questions to YouWhy did Allah permit female genital mutilation?Where did the stoning punishment really come from—Allah or Muhammad?Is Muhammad’s law stronger than Allah’s law?Why was the 100-lashes law cancelled by Hadith?Will unmarried Muslim women in paradise receive 72 husbands the way Muslim men receive 72 virgins?Reflect.Question everything.Take action.And finally…Come to Jesus.He loves women.He honors them.He saves them.And He offers eternal life—not based on gender, but on grace.",

But before questioning this practice, we must first understand the history of kohl and lipstick: When did their use begin? Historically, it is believed that these practices originated in the Arab world, with ancient Egyptian women being particularly skilled in applying cosmetics. This was part of a longstanding cultural tradition that carried deep significance within society.For example, among some African communities such as the Wanyamwezi, Wadigo, and Wabondei, when a girl approached puberty, she was secluded, her body covered in ash, and upon emerging the women would applywanjato her eyes. This ritual signified that the girl was now ready for marriage. A similar cultural meaning existed in the ancient Arab world.Therefore,wanjaheld great symbolic value in early societies, and although the meaning has faded in modern times, among Arab communities a woman wearing kohl and red lipstick traditionally sent a message to men: she was expressing sexual desire. Her facial lips, painted red, represented the swelling and reddening of the genital lips when a woman was sexually aroused. This signaled to men that the woman was experiencing sexual longing.Classical scientists and scholars such asDeus HansandDesmond Morris(19th-century writers) have acknowledged this symbolic connection: when a woman applies kohl and red lipstick, it mimics the appearance of the female genitalia during sexual arousal, when they become swollen and red.Although today most women wear makeup simply as beauty enhancement without implying anything sexual, during the time of Muhammad, the use of kohl and lipstickdidcarry these cultural messages—either sexual desire or readiness for marriage.Islamic sources record that Muhammad himself used kohl. InSunan Ibn Majah, Hadith No. 309, we read:“Muhammad used to carry a horn comb with which he combed his hair. He had oil, and he had a mirror in which he looked at himself, and a container of kohl (wanja) which he applied to himself at night before sleeping. He loved using fragrances…”(Description of the clothing and personal grooming of Muhammad, Section 26)According to the cultural norms of the Arabs at that time, what did it mean for Muhammad to adorn himself in this way?If kohl and lipstick symbolized sexual readiness in women, what was Muhammad’s intention in using them?This raises serious questions within Islamic tradition.Insults are a sign that one has run out of intellectual argument.Bring evidence, not abuse.This is a major theological crisis for Islam.",

These terms did not exist in any historical, linguistic, or religious context prior to the rise of Muhammad in the 7th century CE. Furthermore, there is no extra-Qur’anic or extra-hadith evidence indicating the presence of such terminology or religious identity before Muhammad’s lifetime.1. IntroductionIslamic tradition asserts that all prophets—from Adam to Jesus—were Muslims and taught Islam. While this theological claim is internal to Islamic belief, it does not reflect historical or biblical evidence. The question addressed here is not theological interpretation, buthistorical accuracy. When examined within historical, linguistic, and scriptural frameworks, the assertion that biblical messengers were Muslim is unsupported.This study investigates the origins of the termsMuslimandIslam, their absence in pre-Islamic literature, and the religious identities of biblical figures within their own historical contexts.2. Linguistic and Historical Origins of “Islam” and “Muslim”The termsIslam(submission) andMuslim(one who submits) derive from the Arabic trilateral rootS-L-M. The earliest recorded usage of these terms appearswithin the Qur’an itself, which emerged in the early 7th century CE under Muhammad.2.1 Absence of Islamic Terminology in Ancient SourcesExhaustive examinations of the following literatures revealno occurrenceof the wordsIslam,Muslim, or any semantic equivalents referring to an organized religion prior to the Qur’an:Hebrew Bible / Old Testament (ca. 1400–400 BCE)New Testament (1st century CE)Dead Sea Scrolls (3rd century BCE–1st century CE)Greek, Roman, and Jewish historical works (Herodotus, Josephus, Philo, Tacitus, etc.)Ancient Near Eastern inscriptions from Mesopotamia, Egypt, Canaan, Arabia, and PersiaPre-Islamic Arab poetry (Jāhiliyyah poetry)There isno linguistic evidencethat the termMuslimexisted as a religious identifier before Islam’s emergence.3. Religious Identity of Biblical MessengersEvery messenger in the Bible existed within well-documented historical religious traditions that predate Islam.3.1 Patriarchs (Abraham, Isaac, Jacob)The patriarchs belonged to the ancient Near Eastern Semitic culture and the early Yahwistic tradition. The Bible repeatedly identifies them as worshipers ofYHWH, the God of Israel (Genesis 12:1; Genesis 26:24; Genesis 28:13).Nowhere in the Hebrew Bible is any patriarch described using Arabic religious terminology.3.2 Mosaic Prophets (Moses, Joshua, Samuel, David, Isaiah, Jeremiah, etc.)Moses and the prophets operated within the Israelite covenantal framework established in Exodus, defined by:Torah lawLevitical priesthoodTemple worshipCovenant identity of IsraelThis system is historically and theologically distant from Islam, which appears 2,000 years later.3.3 Jesus and the ApostlesJesus of Nazareth was aJew, born under Jewish law (Galatians 4:4).The New Testament depicts Him teaching in synagogues, attending Jewish festivals, and affirming the Hebrew Scriptures (Matthew 5:17; John 5:39).The apostles, likewise, were Jewish followers of Jesus who proclaimed the gospel within a Jewish and Greco-Roman environment—not an Islamic one.There is no textual or historical evidence that Jesus or His disciples used Arabic religious terms or self-identified as Muslims.4. Pre-Islamic Arabia and the Non-Existence of IslamHistorical studies of Arabia prior to Muhammad reveal a mixture of:Arabian polytheismJewish communitiesChristian groups (Nestorian, Monophysite)Hanifs (monotheistic seekers with no organized system)None of these groups used the termIslamorMuslimas a formal religious identifier.The oldest inscriptions in Arabic—such as the 6th-century Namara inscription—containno referencesto Islam or Muhammad, confirming the religion’s non-existence at the time.5. The Qur’an as the First Appearance of Islamic TermsThe earliest attested use ofIslamandMuslimappears within the Qur’an, including passages such as:Qur’an 3:19: “Indeed, the religion with Allah is Islam.”Qur’an 33:35: “The Muslims, men and women…”Qur’an 22:78: “He named you Muslims…”However, these referencesdo not reflect pre-Islamic usage. Rather, they establish Islam’s theological retrojection—Islam asserts the earlier prophets were Muslimsas a doctrinal claim, not as a historical fact.6. Absence of Extra-Qur’anic EvidenceEven within Islamic historiography, early Muslim historians such as al-Tabari, Ibn Ishaq, and Ibn Hisham admit that:Islam began with MuhammadThe Qur’an is the source of the identity “Muslim”Pre-Islamic Arabs did not use Islamic terminologyThere areno inscriptions, manuscripts, or historical citationsoutside Islamic scripture and tradition that mentionIslamorMuslimbefore Muhammad’s prophetic career.7. ConclusionHistorical, linguistic, and scriptural evidence leads to a definitive conclusion:1. No messenger in the Bible was a Muslim.Their identities were rooted in ancient Israelite and early Christian traditions.2. The termsIslamandMuslimdid not exist before Muhammad.They appear first in the Qur’an in the 7th century CE.3. There is no historical evidence—biblical, archaeological, linguistic, or extra-Qur’anic—to support the idea that Islam existed before Muhammad.Thus, the claim that biblical prophets were “Muslim” is a theological assertion internal to Islamic doctrine,not a historical fact.",

One of the most persistent efforts has come from Islamic theology, which claims continuity with the Judeo-Christian revelation while fundamentally diverging from its core tenets. Islam asserts thatAllahis the same deity worshipped by Christians and Jews; however, this claim warrants serious theological scrutiny.From a biblical and doctrinal standpoint, the God revealed in the person of Jesus Christ — the incarnate Son of God and the second person of the Holy Trinity — is fundamentally distinct from the Allah described in the Qur’an. The Christian understanding of God emphasizes divine love, relationality, and incarnation, culminating in the redemptive work of Christ (John 1:1–14; Colossians 1:15–20). Conversely, the Islamic conception of Allah explicitly denies the Trinity and the Sonship of Christ (Qur’an 4:171; 5:116–117), positioning itself in direct theological opposition to the essence of Christian revelation.This persistent attempt to merge Islamic monotheism with Christian theology represents not a harmonious synthesis, but a form of doctrinal infiltration — an effort to obscure the uniqueness of the Christian faith. The Church must, therefore, remain vigilant in guarding the integrity of its message. As Scripture commands, believers must “contend for the faith that was once for all delivered to the saints” (Jude 1:3). The distinct identity of the Christian God — Father, Son, and Holy Spirit — must be upheld without compromise or confusion.The safeguarding of Christian orthodoxy demands theological clarity, spiritual discernment, and unwavering commitment to the truth revealed in Christ alone (John 14:6). The Church must resist all attempts, however subtle, to conflate the God of the Bible with theological constructs that deny His triune nature and redemptive work through Jesus Christ.",

    "full_content": "Nikāḥ ḥalālah (tahlīl) — an academic overviewBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis short paper explains the Islamic legal rule commonly callednikāḥ ḥalālah(alsotahlīl): the situation in which a woman who has become permanently divorced from her first husband (after a third, irrevocabletalaq) may only remarry him if, after that final divorce, she lawfully marries another man and that marriage is consummated and then ends. The note summarizes the scriptural bases (Qurʾān and ḥadīth), the classical juristic rationale, the prohibition ofpre-arrangedormanufacturedhalālah, and ethical implications. Key primary sources from the hadith corpus are cited.1. Scriptural and textual basisQurʾānic text.The principal Qurʾānic verse is explicit: “And if he has divorced her (the third time), then she is not lawful unto him thereafter until she has married another husband.” (Qurʾān 2:230). This verse is the foundational legal text that creates the condition requiring an intervening marriage after an irrevocable third divorce. (Quran)Prophetic practice and explanatory ḥadīth.The Prophet’s practice and sayings further explain what “another husband” and the required condition mean. Sahih reports narrated in collections such as Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī describe instances and rulings where the Prophet explained that the subsequent husband must consummate the marriage for the woman to become lawful again for her first husband. For example, Bukhārī records the Prophet’s reply that a wife who was divorced and then married another man can only return to her first husband if the second marriage was consummated in the normal way. (Sunnah.com)2. The classical juristic rationaleClassical jurists (Hanafi, Shāfiʿī, Mālikī, and Ḥanbalī schools) read Qurʾān 2:230 together with the Prophet’s explanations to achieve two objectives:Protection against abuse.The rule prevents husbands from treating pronouncements of divorce as a reversible threat (pronouncing and then rescinding talaq capriciously) to coerce wives. The third, irrevocable divorce with the intervening-marriage condition is a deterrent against such abuse.Affirmation of marital sanctity.The requirement of a bona fide intervening marriage and consummation underscores that the woman cannot be made “lawful” again to her first husband by arrangement or artifice; rather a genuine change of marital status must occur. Classical manuals thus emphasize that the intervening marriage must be genuine and not a sham. (See classical commentaries on Kitāb al-Talaq and the works of jurists explaining Qurʾān 2:230.) (Quran)3. Prohibition ofpre-arrangedhalālah (manufactured tahlīl)While the Qurʾān and Sunnah set theconditionfor returning after an irrevocable divorce, the Prophetic literature also contains clear condemnations ofmanufacturedhalālah — that is, when a man marries a divorced woman with the explicit intention of divorcing her solely so that she becomes lawful for her former husband. A hadith reported in Sunan Abī Dāwūd (and reported elsewhere) records the Prophet as saying, in reference to such conduct, “May Allah curse themuhalliland themuhallal lahu” — that is, the man who performs the intervening marriage as a trick and the man for whom this is being done. This hadith has been authenticated by many scholars and is widely used by jurists to declare pre-arranged tahlīl unlawful and morally condemned. (Sunnah.com)Scholarly fatwās and juristic texts therefore distinguish sharply between:A lawful intervening marriage(entered sincerely, consummated, and not undertaken as a ruse), which makes remarriage to the first husband legally possible; andA sham/contracted halālah(a marriage contracted with the explicit, pre-agreed purpose of making the woman lawful for her ex-husband), which is condemned and invalid as a means to circumvent the law. (Islam-QA)4. Representative ḥadīth evidence (select primary references)Qurʾān 2:230— the foundational verse establishing the intervening-marriage condition. (Quran)Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī (Book of Divorce)— narrations describing that the married-again husband must consummate the marriage for return to the first husband to be permissible. (See Bukhārī, Book of Divorce, relevant hadiths). (Sunnah.com)Sunan Abī Dāwūd 2076 / Sunan Ibn Mājah 1934 (and related chains)— the tradition recording: “May Allah curse the muhallil and the muhallal lahu,” used by classical jurists to proscribe pre-arranged halālah. (These reports have been assessed and authenticated to varying degrees by later scholars; they are widely cited in fiqh discussions on nikāḥ halālah.) (Sunnah.com)Note:jurists also consult additional narrations and the context in which early Companions and the Prophet ruled on real cases; see classical commentaries on Kitāb al-Talaq for fuller chains and legal argumentation. (IIUM)5. Practical and ethical considerations for contemporary applicationDo not arrange or instrumentalize another person.Islamic legal ethics and the explicit prophetic condemnation caution strongly against arranging an intervening marriage as a device to reverse an irrevocable divorce. Such behavior is described as sinful in the Prophetic traditions and undermines the moral aims of the law. (Sunnah.com)Protect the vulnerable.In many contemporary contexts, women are at risk when husbands use talaq irresponsibly or when economic and social pressures push women into exploitative arrangements. Scholars emphasize protective measures: family counseling, legal reform where necessary, and community education about the consequences of rash divorces.Authenticity of the second marriage matters.If, after a legitimate and consummated second marriage, that marriage ends (by divorce or death), reunification with the first husband is legally possible — provided the intervening marriage was entered into sincerely and not merely as a pretext. The law thus preserves an objective procedural reality (a genuine change of marital status) while discouraging circumvention. (Pfander Center)6. ConclusionNikāḥ ḥalālah as a legal institution is rooted in Qurʾān 2:230 and expounded in the Sunnah and classical jurisprudence: it permits a woman, after an irrevocable triple divorce, to be lawful again for her first husband only after a genuine interposing marriage that was consummated. However, the prophetic condemnations recorded in the ḥadīth literature make clear thatpre-arrangedorinstrumentaluses of such intervening marriages to circumvent the law are forbidden, morally condemned, and—according to the ḥadīth—cursed. Ethical application therefore requires both fidelity to the text and protection of human dignity.Select bibliography & primary sources (recommended reading)Qurʾān 2:230 (exegesis and classical commentators).

    "full_content": "Islamic Halal Slaughter: A Theological and Ethical CritiqueBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaFrom both a theological and ethical standpoint, the practice of halal slaughter without stunning raises serious moral and scientific concerns. Within Islamic jurisprudence, halal slaughter (dhabiha) requires that the animal be fully conscious at the moment of death, and that its throat be cut while invoking the name of Allah. This process, however, stands in stark contrast to modern principles of animal welfare and humane treatment, which emphasize the reduction of pain and suffering in sentient creatures.Scientific studies in veterinary neurology and physiology have consistently demonstrated that animals subjected to slaughter without stunning experience acute distress, intense fear, and prolonged pain due to the delay in loss of consciousness following exsanguination. The release of catecholamines and corticosteroids—stress hormones triggered by terror and pain—contaminates the bloodstream and muscle tissue, potentially affecting the biochemical composition of the meat. From a biological perspective, such stress responses are not inconsequential; they have measurable implications for both meat quality and public health.Theologically, for Christians, the concept ofhalalcannot be reconciled with Biblical dietary ethics. Acts 15:29 and 1 Corinthians 10:25–28 clearly prohibit the consumption of meat sacrificed to another deity. Therefore, any slaughter performed as a ritual act of devotion to Allah—who is not the Triune God of Christian revelation—renders the meat spiritually unclean (haram) to Christians. The Apostle Paul emphasized that believers must abstain from foods offered in pagan contexts, for participation in such practices implies spiritual fellowship with the altar of another faith (1 Corinthians 10:20–21).In light of these ethical, scientific, and theological realities, halal slaughter without stunning cannot be defended as a humane or theologically neutral act. It represents not only a violation of animal welfare principles but also a fundamental conflict with Christian doctrine concerning sanctified food and worship. Thus, while modern societies continue to advance in moral and scientific understanding, the persistence of ritual slaughter practices that enshrine suffering stands as a relic of antiquity—ethically indefensible, spiritually incompatible, and scientifically harmful.",

    "full_content": "Title: Unequal Equality? A Critical Examination of Race, Gender, and Hierarchy in Early Islamic TextsBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstract:Islam is often presented as a religion promoting universal equality and social justice. Yet, a careful analysis of early Islamic texts—including the Qur’an, Hadith literature, and biographical sources such as Ibn Ishaq’sSirat Rasul Allah—reveals persistent hierarchies based on race, gender, and Arab identity. This article examines these texts critically, exposing tensions between Islam’s theological claims of equality and the practical implications of its early interpretations.1. IntroductionIslamic theology frequently emphasizes that all humans are equal before God. Yet, a deeper exploration of foundational texts shows that equality is often framed in a selective or hierarchical manner. Certain passages appear to marginalize specific groups—most notably women and Black communities—both in moral and eschatological terms. By analyzing these texts in historical and cultural context, this article seeks to understand how early Islamic literature constructs social hierarchies and the implications for contemporary interpretations.2. Race and Moral SymbolismQur’an 3:106 describes the blackening of faces in the context of divine judgment. While some commentators interpret this as symbolic of shame or moral failure, historical reception demonstrates that such imagery has frequently been racialized. Early Islamic narratives, including Ibn Ishaq’sSirat Rasul Allah, at times link Blackness with demonic imagery, creating an association between racial identity and moral corruption. These constructions contribute to a subtle but persistent racial hierarchy that privileges Arab identity over non-Arab peoples.3. Gender and EschatologyHadith literature, particularly Sahih Bukhari, asserts that women constitute the majority of Hell’s inhabitants. Exegesis often attributes this to women’s supposed moral or spiritual failings, including ingratitude or disobedience. This depiction mirrors broader 7th-century Arabian social norms in which women were frequently assigned subordinate roles, yet the theological framing extends these limitations into the eschatological realm. Such narratives reinforce the perception of women as inherently more prone to failure in spiritual and moral terms.4. Arab Supremacy and Cultural HierarchyThe Qur’an repeatedly underscores the primacy of Arabs, emphasizing their role as preservers of the Arabic language and genealogical lineage. This Arab-centric framework intersects with both racial and gender hierarchies, creating a multi-layered social stratification: Arabs at the top, women and non-Arabs often positioned as morally or spiritually inferior. Consequently, the text’s universalistic claims of equality coexist uneasily with these culturally specific hierarchies, revealing a tension between theological ideals and historical realities.5. Theological and Ethical CritiqueThe hierarchical treatment of race and gender in early Islamic texts raises significant ethical and theological questions. While Islam purports to advocate universal equality, textual evidence suggests that equality is conditional, favoring Arab men while subordinating women and Black communities.Racial Implications:Associating moral failure or divine punishment with Blackness undermines the universality of God’s justice. Such interpretations implicitly validate historical racial hierarchies and may contribute to systemic inequities in societies influenced by these texts.Gender Implications:Portraying women as the majority of Hell’s inhabitants contradicts the claim of spiritual equality and imposes a moral burden based on gender alone. This framework perpetuates patriarchal structures under the guise of divine authority.Ethical Tensions:The intersection of race, gender, and Arab identity illustrates a selective application of divine justice. Textual hierarchies create ethical dilemmas: if equality before God is truly universal, why do these texts consistently privilege certain groups over others?This critique demonstrates that Islam’s proclaimed egalitarianism is complicated by historical, textual, and interpretive factors that elevate certain communities while marginalizing others. Addressing these contradictions is essential for any contemporary theological or ethical engagement with Islam.6. ConclusionThis study reveals a persistent tension between Islam’s theological assertion of equality and the hierarchical treatment of race, gender, and Arab identity in foundational texts. Women and non-Arab communities, particularly Black individuals, are disproportionately associated with spiritual failure, while Arab men are positioned as morally and culturally superior. Recognizing and critically analyzing these textual hierarchies is vital for scholars, theologians, and practitioners seeking a more equitable understanding of Islamic ethics and theology.ReferencesThe Qur’an.Sahih Bukhari.Ibn Ishaq,Sirat Rasul Allah.Rahman, F.

In contrast, theQuranic depiction of Allahpresents a being whose attributes, actions, and relationship with humanity differ substantially from the Biblical revelation of God.From aBiblical standpoint, Yahweh is not only the Creator but also arelational and redemptiveGod, revealed through His Son,Jesus Christ(John 1:1-14). Christianity holds that God’s ultimate revelation is incarnated in Christ, who embodies divine love and truth. Conversely,Islamic theology explicitly deniesthe divinity and sonship of Jesus (Quran 4:171), emphasizing absolute monotheism (tawḥīd) in a way that excludes any Trinitarian understanding.Scholars such asNorman GeislerandAbdul Saleeb(Answering Islam: The Crescent in Light of the Cross, Baker, 2002) have argued that, although the termGodmay appear linguistically similar, theontological essence and moral attributesof Allah and Yahweh diverge significantly. TheBiblical Godreveals Himself aslove(1 John 4:8), while theQuranic Allahis primarily characterized bypower and transcendencerather than personal communion.Therefore, the assertion that Allah and Yahweh are the same being is theologically untenable within classical Christian doctrine. Any attempt to conflate the two diminishes theuniqueness of the Trinitarian revelationand the redemptive role of Jesus Christ. For Christians,Yahweh aloneis the one true God, self-revealed in the Scriptures and in His Son—the incarnate Word.",

IntroductionIn the Judeo‑Christian tradition, one of the most momentous revelations of the Divine Name occurs in Exodus 3:14‑15. Moses asks God: “What is Your name?” (3:13). God replies:“I AM WHO I AM” (Hebrew:’ehyeh ’asher ’ehyeh) — “Thus you shall say to the children of Israel: ‘I AM has sent me to you.’” (3:14)Then:“The LORD, the God of your fat",

IntroductionIn the Judeo‑Christian tradition, one of the most momentous revelations of the Divine Name occurs in Exodus 3:14‑15. Moses asks God: “What is Your name?” (3:13). God replies:“I AM WHO I AM” (Hebrew:’ehyeh ’asher ’ehyeh) — “Thus you shall say to the children of Israel: ‘I AM has sent me to you.’” (3:14)Then:“The LORD, the God of your fathers… has sent me to you. This is my name forever, and my memorial to all generations.” (3:15) (Bible Hub)This passage undergirds how God is understood to be self‑existent, eternal, unchanging, and the foundation of covenantal relationship. (Sermon Writer)The question then arises: in the Islamic text, the Qur’an, does God (Allah) ever use the equivalent formula “I AM WHO I AM” or “I am … I am”? If not, why not? That is the thrust of our present reflection.2. Exegesis of Exodus 3:14‑152.1 The Hebrew expressionsIn Exodus 3:14, the Hebrew’ehyeh ’asher ’ehyehis traditionally rendered “I AM WHO I AM” or “I WILL BE WHAT I WILL BE.” Some scholars highlight that the rooth‑y‑hmeans “to be, to become” so the phrase may better reflect God saying: “I will be whatever I will be for you.” (IslamiCity)Then in verse 15 God identifies Himself with the tetragrammaton YHWH (rendered LORD) — “This is my name forever.” Many commentaries take this to mean that the one who declares “I AM” is the same covenant‑keeping God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. (Bible Hub)2.2 The theological import–Self‑existence and aseity: God is not caused, but causes; He simplyis. The “I AM” emphasises that God is independent of the created order. (hub.emmausroadsf.com)–Eternality / immutability: The phrase “This is my name for ever” links God’s name with timelessness and enduring covenant. (Precept Austin)–Covenantal identity: The name YHWH and the “I AM” formula tie the God of Moses to the patriarchal God, signalling continuity of promise. (Logos Sermons)–Revelation of Being: The focus is not just on an attribute but on God’sbeingness. He reveals what He is in Himself and in relation to His people. (abideinchrist.com)2.3 “Memorial to all generations”By declaring “This is my name forever, and this is my memorial to all generations,” God instructs that His name—and what it signifies—be remembered endlessly. The “name” is not merely a label but an invocation of who God is‑‑and what He does. (NEV Bible app with Commentary, free)3. The Islamic side: Names of Allah and “I am” in the Qur’an3.1 Allah’s self‑declarationIn the Qur’an one finds, for example:“Indeed I am Allah. There is no deity except Me; so worship Me and establish prayer for My remembrance.” (Ta‑Ha 20:14) (My Islam)This verse is often cited in discussions of God’s self‑identification in Islam.3.2 Differences in phrasing and emphasisBut while the Qur’an uses “I am Allah,” it doesnotreplicate the exact pattern of “I AM WHO I AM” or an equivalent Hebrew‑style *’ehyeh’ formula. As scholar Christine Schirrmacher notes: “The Koran does not contain any passages which comprise any kind of systematic description of God. … God does not introduce himself in the Koran like he does in the Old Testament with the words ‘I am who I am’.” (islaminstitut.de)3.3 Islamic theology on names and attributesIslamic tradition emphasises that Allah hasbeautiful names(asmâ’ ul‑Ḥusna) and attributes, and that humans may call upon Him by these names. (Islam Religion)The name “Allah” is regarded as the proper name of the one True God in Arabic, but not necessarily as the exclusive name in all languages or traditions. (whoisallah.net)4. Why then does Allah not (appear to) call Himself “I AM WHO I AM”?In light of the above, several observations and scholarly reasons suggest why Islam treats God’s naming somewhat differently.4.1 Linguistic‑cultural context– The Hebrew disclosure in Exodus arises in a specific covenantal, Jewish context, with Hebrew verb forms, Hebrew rooth‑y‑h, and ancient Israelite naming conventions.– The Qur’an is revealed in Arabic, within a different historical‑linguistic milieu. The Arabic phrase “innī anā Allāh, lā ilāha illā anā…” (20:14) means “Indeed I am Allah; there is no god but Me.” The form is different from Hebrew’ehyeh ’asher ’ehyeh.– Because of this the exact Hebrew formula has no direct Arabic parallel in the Qur’an.4.2 Theological orientation– In Judaism/Christianity the “I AM” formula emphasises God’sbeing(ontology) and God’s covenant with Israel.– In Islam the discourse focuses more on God’s unity (tawḥīd), transcendence (tanzīh), and His names/attributes rather than a single ontological self‑formula. The emphasis is onwho Allah isthrough names/attributes rather than a verbal self‑definition of being.– As noted, “Allah” is presented as the proper name for the Creator, and the Qur’an avoids mechanical correspondences with Hebrew theological formulas.4.3 Revelation‑history and continuity– The Torah’s presentation of God’s name is embedded in the Israelite revelation history.– The Qur’an affirms it is the same God of Abraham, Isaac, Ishmael, and Jacob (cf. 28:30; 6:102) but does not reproduce all Old Testament naming conventions.– Some Christian‑Muslim comparative scholars point out that the Qur’an remains “silent” on the Hebrew tetragrammaton and the exact “I AM” self‑designation. (Answering Islam)4.4 Purpose of disclosure– In Exodus, the revelation of the name serves Moses’ mission to deliver Israel, emphasising God’s covenant identity and presence.– In the Qur’an, the self‑statement “I am Allah” serves to assert monotheism, demand worship, and situate prayer for remembrance — a different functional emphasis (see 20:14).– Thus the variant form reflects different redemptive‑historical settings and theological priorities.5. Scholarly Implications for Christian‑Muslim DialogueFrom a theological‑scholarly perspective (as at the Shimba Theological Institute), the following implications emerge:Shared Ground: Both traditions affirm one ultimate Being who exists, sustains, and is to be worshiped. The Exodus “I AM” and Qur’an 20:14 “I am Allah” share the reality of Divine Self‑revelation.Different Emphases: The manner of naming reflects different revelation‑communities: Israel’s covenant identity vs Islam’s universal monotheism.Respectful Recognition: In dialogue, Christians and Muslims can recognise the respective naming‑traditions for what they are—a function of scripture, language, and theology—rather than reductive equivalence.Hermeneutical Caution: One should not impose the Hebrew formula onto the Qur’an or assume its absence implies a deficiency; different revelatory contexts yield different expressions.Opportunity for Deeper Study: Exploring how naming of God functions in each tradition opens up rich fields in theology, comparative religion, and scriptural hermeneutics.6. ConclusionIn conclusion, the fact that the Qur’an doesnotrecord a phrase exactly equivalent to “I AM WHO I AM” (Exodus 3:14) is not evidence of omission or error but ofdifferent revelation‑contexts, languages, theological emphases and purposes. The Hebrew text at Sinai reveals God’s being and covenant name in the heart of Israel’s identity; the Qur’an reveals Allah’s oneness, self‑affirmation and demand for worship in the universal monotheistic framework of Islam.Hence, while Christians may draw meaning from the Exodus revelation of the divine name, Muslims understand Allah through the names and attributes revealed in Arabic, including the statement “I am Allah” — a truth that meets them linguistically and theologically in the Qur’an rather than reproducing the Hebrew phrase verbatim.Bibliography“The Names of God (Part 1 of 3): Who is Allah?” IslamReligion.com.

This paper argues that Jesus’ utterance was a conscious quotation ofPsalm 22, a prophetic psalm fulfilled in His suffering and death. The article explores the linguistic, historical, and theological context of this cry, demonstrating that Jesus’ words reveal prophetic fulfillment and divine intentionality, not divine abandonment. Through a comparative exegesis of Psalm 22 and the Gospel narratives, this study reaffirms the Christological truth that Jesus remained fully aware and obedient to His salvific mission, accomplishing the will of the Father in perfect fulfillment of Scripture.1. IntroductionThe phrase“Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani”—translated“My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?”—has become one of the most debated sayings of Jesus from the cross. Critics within Islamic apologetics have contended that this statement demonstrates that Jesus forgot His mission or lost faith in God at the moment of crucifixion. However, such an interpretation disregards the literary and theological unity of Scripture.Within the Jewish hermeneutic tradition, the opening verse of a psalm often serves as averbal referenceto the entire psalm. Therefore, Jesus’ quotation of Psalm 22:1 must be read as a deliberate invocation of that whole text—a psalm that prophesied the suffering, mockery, piercing, and ultimate vindication of the Messiah.This study argues that Jesus’ quotation was anact of prophetic fulfillment, consciously linking His passion to the messianic prophecy written by David a millennium earlier. Far from being a cry of despair, it was a declaration of divine purpose completed on Calvary.2. The Prophetic Foundation of Psalm 22Psalm 22 stands among the clearest Old Testament anticipations of the crucifixion. It opens with a lament—“My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?”—but progresses toward victory and universal praise. Written around 1000 B.C., it reflects David’s personal suffering while typologically foreshadowing the Messiah’s redemptive agony.The parallels between Psalm 22 and the crucifixion narratives are too specific to be coincidental.Psalm 22 ProphecyFulfillment in the Gospels“All they that see me laugh me to scorn… they shake the head” (v.7)“They that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads” (Matt. 27:39)“He trusted on the LORD that he would deliver him” (v.8)“He trusted in God; let him deliver him now” (Matt. 27:43)“They pierced my hands and my feet” (v.16)“They crucified him” (John 19:18, 20:25)“They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture” (v.18)“They parted his garments, casting lots” (John 19:24)Each of these fulfillments demonstrates that Psalm 22 wasprophetically messianic, and that Jesus intentionally identified Himself as its subject. His utterance, therefore, was ascriptural citationsignaling that the long-foretold suffering servant had come.3. Theological Interpretation of the Cry3.1 Jesus’ Conscious Fulfillment of ScriptureThroughout His ministry, Jesus consistently affirmed that His life and death were in fulfillment of the Law, the Prophets, and the Psalms. InLuke 24:44, He declared,“All things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.”This statement confirms that Jesus viewed His suffering not as failure, but asdivine necessity. His quotation of Psalm 22:1 from the cross must therefore be interpreted as intentional fulfillment, not forgetfulness. By speaking those words, Jesus demonstrated a profound awareness of His mission and a deliberate fulfillment of Davidic prophecy.3.2 The Substitutionary Nature of the CryThe apparent sense of abandonment expressed in“why hast thou forsaken me?”reflects not divine separation, but thevicarious experience of sin. As Paul writes:“For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin.” —2 Corinthians 5:21At that moment, Jesus bore the totality of humanity’s guilt, experiencing the weight of divine justice. The Father did not reject the Son in essence, but the Son endured thefelt absence of communionas He bore sin’s penalty. This was not confusion, but substitution—an atoning act fulfillingIsaiah 53:5:“He was wounded for our transgressions… the chastisement of our peace was upon him.”Thus, the cry representsredemptive identificationwith humanity’s alienation, not divine ignorance.3.3 The Jewish Context and the Invocation of the Entire PsalmIn first-century Judaism, quoting the first verse of a psalm was a recognized method ofinvoking the entire psalm’s message. By utteringPsalm 22:1, Jesus invoked both its lament and its triumphant conclusion. The psalm’s closing verses declare,“For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted… when he cried unto him, he heard” (Psalm 22:24).This demonstrates that Jesus’ cry was not final despair butanticipation of vindication—fulfilled in the resurrection (cf.Hebrews 5:7–9).4. The Fulfillment Pattern in the Passion NarrativesThe New Testament repeatedly emphasizes that every event of the crucifixion fulfilled Old Testament prophecy:Isaiah 53:7–12— The suffering servant prophecy fulfilled in Christ’s death (1 Peter 2:24).Psalm 69:21— “They gave me vinegar to drink,” fulfilled inMatthew 27:34.Zechariah 12:10— “They shall look upon me whom they have pierced,” fulfilled inJohn 19:37.Psalm 31:5— “Into thy hands I commit my spirit,” quoted directly by Jesus inLuke 23:46.Therefore, Jesus’ words from the cross were theculmination of redemptive prophecy, not an emotional lapse. His consciousness of Scripture’s fulfillment underscores His divine mission to complete the work of salvation.5. Refuting the Islamic InterpretationIslamic apologists claim that Jesus’ cry indicates human error or abandonment. This argument fails on three grounds:Christological Context:Jesus, possessing both divine and human natures (Philippians 2:6–8), experienced the full measure of human suffering while remaining omniscient and divine. His cry reveals His humanity’s participation in suffering, not loss of divinity.Scriptural Ignorance of Context:The interpretation ignores the Jewish exegetical practice of psalm invocation and the messianic framework of Psalm 22. Jesus’ words werescriptural identification, not emotional confusion.Consistency with Prophetic Lament Tradition:Even in the Qur’an (e.g., Surah 21:87), prophets such as Jonah express anguish in divine missions. Thus, emotional lament does not indicate forgetfulness but authenticity of suffering in the prophetic experience.Jesus’ cry, therefore, does not disprove His mission—it affirms it. It demonstrates His obedience “unto death, even the death of the cross” (Philippians 2:8), fulfilling the divine plan of redemption.6. The Triumph of the Cross and the Resurrection HopePsalm 22 ends in victory and praise:“All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the LORD” (Psalm 22:27).This prophecy finds its fulfillment in the resurrection and the universal proclamation of the Gospel (Matthew 28:18–20). The cry of“Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani”thus transitions from suffering to triumph—it is thethreshold of victory, soon followed by Jesus’ victorious declaration,“It is finished”(John 19:30).The forsakenness He endured led directly to humanity’s reconciliation. The darkness of Calvary was the necessary prelude to the dawn of resurrection glory.7. ConclusionJesus’ utterance,“Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani,”was not a cry of confusion or divine amnesia but aprophetic citationof Psalm 22. In quoting this psalm, Jesus consciously identified Himself as the suffering Messiah prophesied by David. His words encapsulate both the depth of His atonement and the certainty of His victory.The Christian understanding of this phrase reveals a profound theological truth:God did not forsake Jesus in essence, but through Jesus’ voluntary identification with sin, redemption was made complete.The cry was not abandonment—it was accomplishment.Thus, the Cross was not the end of Christ’s mission but its perfect fulfillment. The Son of God remembered, fulfilled, and completed every word written about Him in the Scriptures.“These things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled” —John 19:36.References and BibliographyThe Holy Bible, King James Version.Augustine,Expositions on the Book of Psalms, Vol. 22.Calvin, John.Commentary on the Psalms.Grand Rapids: Baker, 1996.Brown, Raymond E.The Death of the Messiah.New York: Doubleday, 1994.Carson, D.

If there is, then Muslims, please show it to us.Abu Huraira said,“I heard the Prophet of Allah say, there is no creature born without being touched by Satan. That is why a newborn baby cries loudly when born, because Satan has touched him — except for Mary and her son Jesus. They were never touched by Satan.”Then Abu Huraira said,“And I seek refuge in You (Allah) for her and her offspring from the accursed Satan”(Qur’an 3:36).My brethren, even Muhammad himself admitted thatJesus was never touched by Satan, but he and all Muslims have been touched and influenced by Satan.EVERY MUSLIM HAS A JINN WITHIN THEMJinn have been granted permission to dwell within the body of any Muslim; therefore, every Muslim has at least one Jinn or more. Likewise, Jinn are permitted to dwell in the homes of Muslims. In every house of a believer of that religion, there resides one or more Jinn.It is undeniable that without Jinn there is no Islam — just as without the Holy Spirit there is no Christianity.It was Jinn who took Prophet Muhammad into the valleys for forty days, where they began instructing him on establishing the Islamic faith.NOW LET US STUDY JESUS CHRISTJesus was conceived by theSpirit of God–Matthew 1:18TheHoly Spiritdescended upon Him at His baptism –Luke 3:22Jesus wasled by the Holy Spirit–Luke 4:1Jesus returned to Galileein the power of the Holy Spirit–Luke 4:14Jesus said,“The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me…”–Luke 4:18Jesusrejoiced in the Holy Spirit–Luke 10:21The ministry of Jesus was directed by theHoly Spirit–Acts 2:22He wasanointed with the Holy Spirit–Acts 10:38Heoffered Himself and diedthrough theSpirit–Hebrews 9:14He wasraised to life by the Holy Spirit–1 Peter 3:18UNCLEAN SPIRITS (JINN) WORSHIP ALLAH AND MUHAMMADAccording to the Qur’an, Allah said:“I created mankind and jinn only to worship Me”(Qur’an 51:56; 57:58).The Qur’an also records that in heaven,Jinn who converted to Islam around 620 ADworship Allah (Qur’an 72:14). These “good Jinn” are said to travel and inherit eternal life inAkhirah(the afterlife or underworld).The main goal of Satan and his Jinn is to befriend as many humans as possible so that, through their numbers, he will drag multitudes with him intoHell (Jahannam)(Qur’an 6:128).It is crucial to know thatthe eternal fire was not created for humans but for Satan and his angels(Jinn or demons). They have no opportunity for repentance or forgiveness.Jesus Christ — whom Muslims recognize only as a prophet —had no fellowship with Satan or demons. Instead, He commanded demons (Jinn) to come out of people possessed by them (Matthew 8:29; Mark 5, etc.).When Jesus ascended, He was taken up by a cloud into heaven — upward — as the Qur’an itself confirms that heaven is above.Jesus was able to ascend and enter Heaven, but the Jinn (demons) who try to approach are struck by blazing fire. We see that even the Jinn who “converted to Islam” dwell in theAkhirah— the underworld.So where do you think other Muslims will end up eternally?In Islamic belief, when a Muslim dies, two Jinn are assigned to guard him in the grave.EVERY MUSLIM HAS A JINN WITHIN THEM (Reemphasized)Jinn are permitted to live within Muslims; hence, every Muslim possesses at least one Jinn. Jinn also inhabit their homes. It is an undeniable truth thatwithout Jinn there is no Islam, just as without theHoly Spirit there is no Christianity.It was Jinn who took Muhammad into the valleys for forty days to instruct him concerning the establishment of Islam.MY ADVICE TO CHRISTIANSMy free advice to every Christian is this:Never abandon Christto follow the religions of demons (1 Timothy 4:1–2).Jinn and demons are one and the same; there is no difference between them. All of them rebelled against God and were cast down to earth.The Bible says there isno forgiveness for Jinn, for they have already been judged and are only awaiting eternal damnation in Hell.Satan is still the“prince of the power of the air”(Ephesians 2:2). This means that Satan and the fallen angels can influence our minds and thoughts through music, television, discussions, etc.We are commanded to guard our thoughts and imaginations (2 Corinthians 10:3–5).2 Corinthians 4:4tells us that“the god of this world has blinded the minds of unbelievers so that they cannot see the light of the gospel.”Satan is behind all false religions and worldly doctrines. He will do everything in his power to oppose God and all who follow Him.But the final destiny of Satan is already sealed:the lake of fire forever(Revelation 20:10).God bless you greatly.Shalom.Max Shimba, servant of Jesus Christ the Mighty God (Titus 2:13).",

    "full_content": "Title:Sheikh Arrested for Selling Pork as Lamb: A Case Study in Religious Ethics and Consumer DeceptionBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis article examines a recent case involving a Muslim cleric (Sheikh) who was apprehended for selling pork falsely labeled as lamb in a local market. The incident raises significant ethical, theological, and legal concerns within Islamic jurisprudence and broader interfaith discussions about integrity in religious and commercial practices. The case also illuminates the tension between ritual observance and moral authenticity in religious leadership.IntroductionReligious authority carries an inherent expectation of integrity, especially in the observance of dietary laws. In Islam, dietary regulations (halal and haram) are central to Muslim identity and practice. The deliberate misrepresentation of haram food as halal constitutes not only commercial fraud but also a profound violation ofShariahprinciples. Recently, a Muslim Sheikh was found guilty of selling pork chops under the label of lamb and was subsequently ordered to destroy the prohibited meat. His defense—that the pork had been “halal prepared” and prayed over—has generated public outrage and theological debate.Background and ContextThe Islamic dietary code, as delineated in theQur’anandHadith, explicitly prohibits the consumption of pork.Surah al-Baqarah2:173 states:“He has only forbidden you dead animals, blood, the flesh of swine, and that which has been dedicated to other than Allah.”Similarly,Surah al-Ma’idah5:3 reiterates that the flesh of swine isharamunder all circumstances, regardless of how it is prepared or blessed. The claim that pork can be made permissible through prayer contradicts foundational Islamic theology, which views divine law (Shariah) as immutable and not subject to human alteration.Ethical and Theological AnalysisFrom a theological standpoint, the Sheikh’s justification represents a grave misunderstanding offiqh al-halal wal-haram(jurisprudence of lawful and unlawful). Prayer (dua) or invocation cannot transform the ontological status of what is inherentlyharam. This act, therefore, reflects a deliberate manipulation of religious authority to exploit consumer trust—a direct violation ofamanah(trustworthiness), a virtue highly emphasized by Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), who said:“He who deceives us is not one of us.” (Sahih Muslim 101)Furthermore, in Islamic ethics, the integrity of trade is not merely an economic issue but a moral one. The Prophet himself was a merchant and repeatedly stressed honesty in transactions. This case highlights how commercial deceit within a religious context erodes the moral fabric of the community and damages the credibility of religious leadership.Legal ImplicationsLegally, the Sheikh faces multiple charges, including consumer fraud, misrepresentation, and violation of public health regulations. In many countries with Muslim populations, selling pork under false labeling can constitute both a criminal and religious offense. Moreover, his claim that the pork was “halal prayed over” may constitute an aggravating factor, as it involves blasphemous misuse of religious ritual for economic gain.Societal and Interfaith ImplicationsBeyond the Islamic community, this incident affects interfaith relations by undermining public trust in halal certification and Islamic commerce. Non-Muslims who purchase halal products for ethical or dietary reasons may also feel deceived. The misuse of religious authority for profit risks reinforcing negative stereotypes about religious hypocrisy, further straining relations between faith communities.ConclusionThe case of the Sheikh selling pork disguised as lamb serves as a cautionary example of how religious authority, when abused, can lead to both moral and societal decay. No amount of prayer can render what is intrinsically forbidden as permissible. The incident underscores the need for stronger regulatory frameworks in halal certification, greater accountability among religious leaders, and renewed emphasis onakhlaq(moral character) within Islamic education.ReferencesThe Holy Qur’an, Surah al-Baqarah 2:173; Surah al-Ma’idah 5:3.Sahih Muslim, Hadith No. 101.Al-Ghazali, Abu Hamid.Ihya Ulum al-Din(The Revival of Religious Sciences).Kamali, Mohammad Hashim.Principles of Islamic Jurisprudence.Islamic Texts Society, 1991.Yusuf al-Qaradawi.The Lawful and the Prohibited in Islam.American Trust Publications, 1985.Shimba, Maxwell.Ethics and Deception in Religious Leadership.Shimba Theological Institute Press, 2024.",

    "full_content": "Muhammad, Prophecy, and the Test of a True MessengerAn academic theological critique arguing that Muhammad’s prophetic claims lack verifiable, non-self-fulfilling fulfillmentsBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba — Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis paper evaluates the claim that the Prophet Muhammad produced verifiable, non-self-fulfilling prophecies during his lifetime. Using a working definition of “prophecy” drawn from classical prophetic tests (precision, antecedence, and non-self-fulfillment), the study surveys the principal items commonly cited by Muslim apologetics as Muhammad’s predictions and subjects them to historiographical and methodological scrutiny. The paper concludes that the corpus of alleged prophetic fulfillments is philosophically and evidentially insufficient to demonstrate authentic prophetic foresight in the classical sense; many purported “prophecies” are either (a) recorded long after the events they allegedly predict, (b) stated in vague or symbolic terms, or (c) plausibly self-fulfilling. On that basis the claim that Muhammad was a divinely endowed predictor of future events — a key test used in many theistic traditions to verify genuine prophecy — is not established to the standard expected of a true prophet.1. IntroductionWithin classical theologies that take prophecy to be one of the distinctive marks of divine revelation, certain criteria are typically used to evaluate claims of prophetic authenticity: (1)antecedence— the prediction is recorded prior to the occurrence; (2)precision— the prediction is specific enough to be falsifiable; and (3)non-self-fulfillment— the fulfillment cannot plausibly be explained as the result of human agency acting to bring about the foretold outcome. Applying these criteria to any candidate for prophetic status is an essential cross-check against wishful reading, retrospective interpolation and hagiographic embellishment.Advocates of Muhammad’s prophethood often point to a catalogue of predictions found in the Qur’an and the hadith corpus — for example, predictions about the conquest of Mecca, the future fortunes of Byzantium and Persia, the spread of Islam, and the division of the Muslim community into sects. Apologetic treatments frequently assemble many such items and argue that the number and specificity of fulfilled predictions constitute strong evidence of prophetic access to the unseen (al-ghayb).¹This paper interrogates those claims by asking three questions for each alleged prophecy: (i) is the prediction attested in sources which clearly pre-date the event? (ii) is the prediction specific? and (iii) could the outcome plausibly have been brought about by ordinary human agency (including strategic action, rhetoric, or later redaction)?2. Methodology and SourcesBecause much of the material cited for Muhammad’s predictions appears in the hadith literature, a historiographical approach is necessary. Modern scholarship emphasizes careful dating and textual criticism of early Islamic sources; many hadith were compiled and canonized generations after the Prophet’s death, and some traditions clearly reflect later community memory or theological needs rather than contemporaneous reportage.² For context and scholarly orientation this paper uses representative academic treatments (e.g., W. Montgomery Watt’s studies) and a sample of both apologetic and critical analyses of the prophetic material.³Where possible, primary texts (Qur’anic passages and the earliest hadith collections) are used; where the evidence consists mainly of later compilations, this is noted. This study focuses on the most often-cited \"prophecies\" rather than attempting an exhaustive catalogue, because the methodological problems affecting a representative set will generalize to the broader corpus.3. Defining “Prophecy” for the TestFor the purposes of theological evaluation here, aprophecyis defined narrowly as:a specific, timestamped prediction of a future observable event that (a) was recorded prior to the occurrence, (b) could not be reasonably brought about by the predictor or their immediate agents, and (c) is not so vague that it admits many possible fulfillments.This restrictive definition is intentionally demanding because the standards for verifying prospective, divinely-inspired revelation should be rigorous. Note also that different religious traditions apply different tests; this paper argues from the common classical standard that is, historically, used to validate prophetic claims in Judaeo-Christian theological debate.4. Examination of Representative Alleged Prophecies4.1 The Conquest of MeccaIslamic sources report that Muhammad foretold the Muslims’ eventual control of Mecca (e.g., Qurʾān 48:27 is taken by some as anticipatory). Apologetic accounts present this as a clear, antecedent prediction that was fulfilled when Muslims entered Mecca peacefully in 630 CE.⁴Critical issues.The Qurʾān passage often cited is part of a revelatory discourse produced during the Prophetic mission and was preserved by believers; its dating relative to the conquest is debated, and the text may have been recited or redacted in community contexts that presuppose later events. Moreover, the conquest of Mecca is a plausible political outcome given the trajectory of Muhammad’s career, strategic alliances, and shifting polities in the Arabian peninsula. Thus the event fails the non-self-fulfillment test: human agency (military, diplomatic, and social factors) plausibly explains the outcome without recourse to supernatural prediction. The methodological problem is compounded by the textual transmission gap between utterance and later codification. (For apologetic presentation of this prophecy see Yaqeen Institute’s compilation; for methodological cautions see critical hadith surveys.)(Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research)4.2 The Fall of the Sassanian Empire and Roman MisfortunesSeveral hadith and later Muslim writings attribute to Muhammad predictions that Persia (Sassanian Empire) would be overturned and that Byzantium would suffer and later be weak. Apologists point to the rapid Muslim conquests of Persian territory and Byzantine borderlands as confirmatory.(Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research)Critical issues.The prediction, where attested, is often general and lacks dating. The collapse of Persia was not an unforeseeable miracle in 7th-century Near Eastern geopolitics; both Sassanian and Byzantine polities were strained by prolonged conflict and internal problems. Moreover, many of the hadith that mention such geopolitical developments circulated in contexts after the events became common knowledge. Hence the antecedence and textual reliability are suspect. See scholarly treatments of early Islamic expansion and the historiography of prophetic attributions (Watt).(Internet Archive)4.3 Predictions about the Community — Division into SectsCertain traditions ascribe to Muhammad predictions about the Muslim community dividing into many sects and about the qualities of future groups. These statements are cited as prophetic insight into social-religious developments.(islamawareness.net)Critical issues.These statements are often couched in general terms (“you will be divided into sects”) and could be either observations of sociological tendency or post-factum moralizing readings. Vagueness reduces the claim’s diagnostic value as genuine prophecy.4.4 Other Alleged Predictions (Numbers, Specific Events)Apologetic lists sometimes assemble dozens of alleged fulfilled predictions (e.g., specific battles, the fate of named individuals, long-range eschatological signs). Close examination often shows these items are (a) reported in late hadith compilations, (b) ambiguous or symbolic, or (c) retrospectively reinterpreted to fit outcomes. Critical compilations and surveys of prophetic hadith point out the late and variable nature of many of these reports.(ResearchGate)5. Two Central Methodological Problems5.1 Late Attestation and Textual FormationA substantial body of the so-called prophecies is found exclusively in the hadith literature, which was compiled and canonized decades to centuries after the Prophet’s death. Modern historians emphasize that many hadith reflect the social and theological concerns of later Muslim communities; hence treating them as straightforward eyewitness predictions is epistemically problematic. The late attestation problem undermines antecedence.(WikiIslam)5.2 Vagueness and Self-FulfillmentMany alleged prophecies are framed in broad, morally inflected or symbolic language. Vague predictions generate an interpretive space that can be retrofitted to many outcomes. Additionally, certain statements—particularly those concerning political rise, territorial fortunes, or the survival of a community—can be rendered true through the actions of the prophet and his followers; that is, strategic action can make a “prediction” come true without any supernatural foresight. This undercuts the non-self-fulfillment criterion.6. Comparison with Classical Tests of ProphecyClassical Judaeo-Christian polemics have long insisted that genuine prophecy is specific, antecedent, and non-self-fulfilling (cf. Deut. 18:21–22 and various prophetic tests in the Hebrew Scriptures). When evaluated against these classical criteria, the corpus of Muhammad’s alleged predictive sayings does not, as a whole, meet the standard. Either the textual basis is too late/uncertain, the content is too vague, or the fulfillment can reasonably be explained by ordinary historical causation.W. Montgomery Watt and other modern historians treat Muhammad primarily as a religious and political leader whose actions and sayings shaped the emerging Muslim community; Watt’s careful historiography provides a tempering voice against uncritical acceptance of late hagiographic material.(Internet Archive)7. Objections and RepliesObjection (Apologetic):Muslim scholasticism asserts many authentic prophetic predictions recorded in reliable hadith; numerous fulfilled items demonstrate divine foreknowledge. (Apologetic compilations list dozens of items.)(Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research)Reply:Even if many hadith are sincere community memories, the epistemic question is whether they supply antecedent, precise, and non-self-fulfilling predictions. Apologetic lists frequently fail on one or more of those points. A fair assessment allows that some sayings may be authentic in the narrow sense, but authenticity of transmission is not equivalent to demonstrable divine foresight.Objection (Historicist):Some predictions are attested in Qurʾānic passages that were clearly available before later events.Reply:Where the Qurʾān is unambiguously antecedent, the normative burden is to show the statement is specific and could not be read as a general promise or rhetorical assurance. Many Qurʾānic verses praised ultimate vindication or foretold moral outcomes without the fine grain of a falsifiable predictive proposition.8. ConclusionApplying a strict criterion for what counts as demonstrable prophecy — antecedence, specificity, and non-self-fulfillment — the case for Muhammad as a prophet who produced verifiable, non-self-fulfilling predictions during his lifetime is weak. Much of the material cited as prophetic fulfillment derives from later hadith collections or is too vague or plausibly self-fulfilling to satisfy the classical tests. Therefore, from the standpoint of these classical and epistemic standards, the prophetic credentials of Muhammad judged by predictive demonstration are not established.That said, historical and religious assessment of a figure’s authority may legitimately rely on other kinds of evidence (ethical teaching, socioreligious transformation, scriptural claims, spiritual fruits). This paper has confined itself to the single criterion of predictive demonstration because the user requested an argument focused on prophecy. When judged solely by that test, the available evidence is insufficient to vindicate Muhammad’s status as a predictive prophet in the classical sense.Bibliography & Selected References(Representative works and sources consulted; primary texts and both apologetic and critical secondary literature.)Watt, W.

    "full_content": "Muhammad, Prophecy, and the Theological Criterion of a True ProphetAn academic critique arguing that Muhammad did not fulfill the weightier prophetic expectations of the Judeo-Christian canonical traditionBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba — Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis paper examines the claim—advanced here as a theological hypothesis—that Muḥammad of 7th-century Arabia does not meet the canonical prophetic criteria set forth in the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament and, therefore, from that Judeo-Christian theological vantage point, should be judged a false prophet. The argument proceeds in three stages: (1) articulation of a rigorous theological-hermeneutical criterion for what constitutes a bona fide prophet within the biblical tradition; (2) analysis of the principal prophetic expectations (messianic, covenantal, and eschatological) found in the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament that later figures claiming prophetic status are measured against; (3) a critical appraisal of Muslim claims that Muḥammad fulfills biblical prophecy and of the internal Islamic corpus of prophetic predictions attributed to Muḥammad. The paper concludes that Muḥammad fails to satisfy the substantive prophetic markers (as understood in the canonical Judeo-Christian framework) and therefore, within that framework, must be assessed as a false prophet. Counterarguments are noted and discussed.IntroductionThe question whether a given claimant to prophetic office is genuine or false is not merely historical; it is theological and hermeneutical. For Jews and Christians the test is traditionally not popularity or charisma but conformity to earlier revelation and to the explicit markers of authentic prophecy preserved in Scripture. This study does not attempt to adjudicate the internal piety or moral character of Muḥammad as a historical person; rather it asks whether Muḥammad, as a prophetic claimant, fulfills the canonical prophetic expectations of the Bible and the New Testament. If a claimant fails those criteria, then within that theological system the claimant is properly designated a false prophet (cf. Deut. 13; Deut. 18:15–22; Matt. 7:15–23; 24:24).Methodological premises and theological criteria for “true prophecy”For clarity I adopt the following working criteria drawn from the canonical Jewish and Christian traditions:Conformity to prior revelation (canonical continuity).A true prophet speaks on behalf of YHWH (or, in Christian perspective, in continuity with the self-revelation culminating in Christ). The prophet’s message must cohere with the Torah and the prophetic corpus (Deut. 13; 18:15–22).Christological fulfillment (for Christian assessment).From a Christian hermeneutic, the ultimate test of prophetic authenticity is conformity to the person and work of Jesus Christ. Messianic and soteriological expectations in the Hebrew Bible that Christians read as fulfilled in Jesus are decisive markers.Veracity of predictive prophecy.When a claimant asserts predictive prophecy as a credential, the predictions must be specific, verifiable, and not subject to after-the-fact interpretation. Deuteronomy 18:21–22 gives an empirical test: a prophecy that does not come to pass identifies the speaker as a false prophet.Ethical and theological fruit.Jesus himself taught that the “fruit” (ethical, theological, soteriological effect) of prophetic ministry reveals its origin (Matt. 7:15–20).These criteria will guide the subsequent examination.I. Biblical prophecies often adduced for Muḥammad — close reading and theological assessmentScholars and exegetes (from both Muslim and some Christian apologetic circles) commonly appeal to a small set of biblical passages as prefiguring or predicting Muḥammad. I examine the major ones and evaluate the plausibility of those identifications.1. Deuteronomy 18:15–18 (“a prophet like Moses”)Muslim apologetics often claim that Deut. 18:18 — “I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brethren” — points to Muḥammad. The Christian exegesis traditionally understands the passage within Israelite context (a prophet from among Israel or from “their brethren” — commonly read as a reference to a prophet from within Israel’s own covenantal milieu or, in Christian reading, as anticipation of Christ and the prophetic office culminating in Him). Two interpretive difficulties arise for identifying Muḥammad with this text:Contextual and canonical trajectory.The Deuteronomic promise is embedded within Israel’s covenantal framework and functions as a successor pattern within Israel (cf. Josh. 1; the Moses–Joshua pattern). The broader canonical reading (cf. Acts 3:22–26; 7:37) in the New Testament explicitly applies the promise to Jesus, not to an external non-Israelite figure.Semantic and typological expectations.The figure “like Moses” implies covenantal, mediatorial, and law-giving functions. Muḥammad’s ministry, while legislative in the Islamic corpus, diverges substantially from the typological expectations Christians derive from Moses culminating in Christ.From a canonical Christian hermeneutic, therefore, Deut. 18:15–18 cannot plausibly be read as referring to Muḥammad.2. The “Paraclete” passages in the Gospel of John (John 14–16)Some Muslim interpreters claim that Jesus’ promise of another “Paraclete” (Greek: Paraklētos) is a prophecy of Muḥammad. The Christian theological tradition reads the Paraclete as the Holy Spirit (see John 14:16–17; 15:26; 16:7–15). Arguments against identifying the Paraclete as Muḥammad include:Lexical and contextual exegesis.John's immediate context describes the Paraclete as “the Spirit of truth” who will dwell with and in the disciples (14:17), teach, and guide into all truth (16:13). These are spiritual functions incompatible with a human messenger.Chronological and narrative horizon.The Johannine account situates the Paraclete’s coming as a consequence of Jesus’ ascension (cf. Acts 1–2 and Pentecost), not as an out-of-context arrival centuries later in Arabia.Therefore the Christian exegesis holds that John’s Paraclete is not a prediction of Muḥammad; reading it thus stretches both grammar and narrative logic.3. Old Testament “nations” and ambiguous oracles (e.g., Isaiah, Psalms, Daniel)Apologists sometimes appeal to prognostications about a future “light to the nations” or ambiguous oracles as vaguer anticipations of Muḥammad. Two methodological cautions apply:Vagueness invites retrojection.Highly general texts can be read after the fact to fit many figures; this is not a secure method for establishing fulfilled prophecy according to Deuteronomy’s empirical test.Canonical interpretive tradition.The Jewish and Christian interpretive histories do not point to Muḥammad for these texts; post-biblical identification requires extraordinary hermeneutical justification which is not supplied in the canonical record.II. Internal Islamic prophetic claims: predictive prophecy and empirical verificationIslamic primary sources (Qur’an and Hadith) contain reports of Muḥammad making predictions (e.g., predictions of battles, the conquest of Mecca, the expansion of Islam). From a purely historical perspective some of those purported predictions appear to have been fulfilled. This raises the question: if Muḥammad made verifiable predictions that came to pass, does this satisfy Deuteronomy’s test?Three caveats temper that conclusion:Selective reporting and retrospective narration.Many hadith and sira traditions were compiled decades after Muḥammad’s death and sometimes shaped by occurrences they narrate; therefore retrospective narrator bias and hagiographic shaping must be considered.Vagueness and probability.Some reported predictions are either sufficiently vague or concern events with significant probability (e.g., regional conflicts, shifting alliances), allowing post-hoc fitting.Canonical primacy and theological content.Even if Muḥammad predicted particular events, the biblical test also demands conformity with prior revelation (Deut. 13). Predictions that conflict with prior revelation or that produce theological dissonance with earlier revelation are disqualifying for someone claiming prophetic authority in the Judeo-Christian schema.Thus, the presence of some fulfilled predictions in the Islamic record is not dispositive in favor of genuine prophecy as judged by the biblical canonical standard.III. The central Christian test: Christological fulfillment and soteriological claimsFor the Christian theological posture, the decisive standard is Christological. Biblical prophecy points forward to the work and person of the Messiah and culminates in Christ (cf. Luke 24:25–27; John 5:39). Two central failures appear when evaluating Muḥammad against this standard:Denial of the Incarnation and Atonement.Muḥammad’s message (as recorded in the Qur’an and hadith traditions) rejects the Christian claims regarding the divine Sonship and the atoning, substitutionary work of Christ (cf. Qur’an 4:157–158; 5:72; see also Islamic theological sources). For Christians these doctrines are non-negotiable axis points of redemptive history. By denying them, Muḥammad’s message is theologically incompatible with the trajectory of biblical revelation.Absence of fulfillment of messianic criteria.Messianic expectations traditionally include an everlasting covenant, universal knowledge of God, and the consummation of divine rule (Isaiah 2, 9, 11; Daniel 7). Muḥammad’s career, while establishing a powerful religious and political order, did not fulfill the particular, specific Jewish and Christian eschatological and messianic expectations as those are read in the biblical canon (e.g., unending Davidic reign in the form expected by Israel; universal eschatological reconciliation as interpreted by Christian exegesis).From a Christian theological vantage, therefore, Muḥammad’s message disconfirms rather than confirms the messianic expectations Christians read into Scripture.IV. Ethical and theological fruit: fruit-testing the prophetic ministry (Matt. 7:15–20)Jesus taught discernment by fruit: good trees bear good fruit and bad trees bad fruit. Evaluating fruit must be careful and nuanced; it cannot be reduced to political success or to moral reform alone. Key observations:Mixed ethical outcomes.The expansion of Islam under Muḥammad and the early caliphate involved both socio-religious reforms and practices that Christian ethics critique (e.g., treatment of certain non-Muslim communities, the normative formulations in Islamic law that conflict with Christian moral theology).Doctrinal fruit.Theologically, the replacement of Christology with a radically different soteriology and christology is decisive. For Christians the replacement of the gospel by an alternative soteriology is theological evidence against prophetic authenticity.The fruit test, therefore, when applied within the Christian theological hermeneutic, points away from acceptance of Muḥammad as a true prophet.V. Counterarguments and their assessmentMuslim exegetes and many modern scholars advance several defenses:Muhammad fulfilled prophecies in the Qur’an and hadith and thus is authenticated.Response: internal claims within a religious corpus cannot, by themselves, settle disputes between competing religious canons; external corroboration and conformity with prior revelation remain necessary for a Judeo-Christian assessment.Biblical texts were corrupted or mistranslated; hence Deuteronomy’s promise could refer to Muḥammad.Response: this claim requires proof of wholesale corruption that is historically and textually demonstrable. While textual history is complex, the burden of proof rests with those asserting corruption—or else a claim that invalidates one tradition’s hermeneutical authority cannot be used to validate another.The Paraclete and other texts were mistranslated from Greek/Aramaic and actually refer to Muḥammad.Response: the Greek term paraklētos has a clear semantic range in the New Testament context; merely proposing a different referent undermines the literary and theological coherence of John’s Gospel and of early Christian interpretive history.Where counterarguments raise serious academic questions, they deserve scholarly engagement; however, none meets the canonical and hermeneutical standards articulated above.ConclusionAssessing Muḥammad from the perspective of the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament, and applying those traditions’ own internal standards for prophetic authenticity, leads to the conclusion advanced in this paper: Muḥammad does not satisfy the canonical criteria for a true prophet as understood within the Judeo-Christian theological tradition. He fails the tests of canonical continuity, Christological fulfillment, and (in relevant ways) the empirical and ethical tests laid down in Scripture. Accordingly, within that theological frame, Muḥammad must be judged a false prophet.This conclusion is theological and confessional in nature. It does not assert the illegitimacy of Muslim piety or the sincerity of Muslim faith; rather it applies a particular theological standard (the biblical canon and the Christian reading of it) and finds that Muḥammad does not meet that standard. Honest interfaith dialogue requires clarity about such doctrinal judgments even while upholding charity and scholarly rigor.Selected references and bibliographyPrimary sourcesThe Holy Bible (useful modern translations: New International Version; English Standard Version).The Qur’an.

IntroductionIslam claims theological coherence through the principle ofKhatm an-Nubuwwah—the finality of Muhammad’s prophethood. This concept is foundational to Islamic belief and a cornerstone of Muslim identity. However, the affirmation of Jesus’ second coming introduces a paradox. If Jesus was a prophet before Muhammad and is to return after Muhammad, then logically, Muhammad cannot be thelast prophet.This paper explores whether Islamic doctrine maintains internal consistency in its claims about Muhammad’s finality and Jesus’ eschatological return.2. The Claim of Final Prophethood2.1 Quranic BasisThe central text supporting Muhammad’s finality is:“Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but (he is) the Messenger of Allah and the Seal of the Prophets (Khatam an-Nabiyyin). And Allah has full knowledge of all things.”—Surah al-Ahzab (33:40)Muslim scholars, such as Al-Tabari and Al-Qurtubi, interpretKhatam an-Nabiyyinas the “final and ultimate prophet,” after whom no new prophet shall arise. This verse has been used to reject any subsequent prophetic claims, such as those of the Ahmadiyya movement or other heterodox sects.However, this claim becomes problematic when juxtaposed with Quranic and Hadith passages describing the eschatological return of Jesus (Isa ibn Maryam).3. The Return of Jesus in Islamic Theology3.1 Quranic ReferencesSeveral Quranic verses are interpreted by Muslim exegetes to refer to Jesus’ second coming:Surah al-Nisa 4:159:“There is none from the People of the Scripture but that he will surely believe in him before his death, and on the Day of Resurrection he will be a witness against them.”Surah al-Zukhruf 43:61:“And indeed, he [Jesus] will be a sign for the Hour, so be not in doubt of it.”Surah Ali ‘Imran 3:55:“Allah said, ‘O Jesus, indeed I will take you and raise you to Myself and purify you from those who disbelieve…’”Traditional interpretations (e.g., Ibn Kathir, Al-Jalalayn) claim these verses allude to the eschatological descent of Jesus before the Day of Judgment, where he will rule with justice, break the cross, kill the swine, and restore true religion.3.2 Hadith TestimonyTheSahih al-BukhariandSahih Muslimcollections contain numerous narrations affirming Jesus’ return:“By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, surely (Jesus) the son of Mary will soon descend among you and will judge mankind justly (as a just ruler); he will break the cross and kill the pig and abolish the jizya.”—Sahih al-Bukhari 3448; Sahih Muslim 155This raises theological questions:If Jesus returns tojudge mankindandenforce divine law, are these not prophetic functions? If so, Muhammad’s prophethood cannot be the last.4. The Theological Dilemma4.1 The ContradictionMuslim scholars attempt to resolve this tension by arguing that Jesus will not return as anewprophet, but as afollower of Muhammad. Yet, this reasoning fails under scrutiny. Jesus cannot besubordinateto Muhammad since, according to Islamic doctrine, Jesus was born without sin, performed miracles, and was taken up alive by Allah.If Jesus returns with divine authority, performing prophetic duties, and executing eschatological justice, then by function and title, he remains a prophet. Hence, the claim that Muhammad is the “last prophet” collapses under its own theological weight.4.2 Logical ImplicationsIfJesus returns as a Prophet, Muhammad cannot be the last prophet.IfJesus does not return as a Prophet, what then is his role? A mere man cannot fulfill divine eschatological purposes.IfJesus returns with divine power, Islam inadvertently affirms Hisdivine nature—a direct contradiction to Tawhid (Islamic monotheism).Thus, Islam faces a theological impasse: either contradict the Quran (by affirming another prophet) or contradict its doctrine of monotheism (by affirming Jesus’ divine authority).5. Comparative Biblical PerspectiveThe Bible teaches that Jesus is bothProphetandGod incarnate(John 1:1; Hebrews 1:1–3). His return is not as aprophet succeeding another, but asthe King of Kings and Lord of Lords(Revelation 19:16).The confusion within Islamic eschatology arises because it denies Christ’s divinity yet attributes to Him divine functions — judgment, resurrection, and the final victory over evil — all uniquely God’s prerogatives.6. Why So Many Confusions in Islam?The contradictions between Muhammad’s finality and Jesus’ return illustrate a larger pattern of inconsistency within Islamic theology. These include:Doctrinal inconsistency:Quranic verses interpreted beyond their linguistic and historical context.Theological borrowing:Islamic eschatology borrows heavily from Christian and Jewish apocalyptic traditions but adapts them inconsistently.Prophetic hierarchy confusion:The Quran honors Jesus yet demotes Him below Muhammad, producing conflicting authority structures.In the pursuit of asserting Muhammad’s supremacy, Islam inadvertently undermines its own claim of theological consistency.7. ConclusionIslam’s doctrine of the finality of prophethood collapses when examined in light of Jesus’ eschatological return. Either Islam must accept that another prophet—Jesus—will appear after Muhammad, or redefine its understanding of Jesus in a manner that contradicts its own scripture.The Christian revelation resolves this tension clearly: Jesus Christ is not merely a prophet but the eternal Son of God, who will return not as a messenger, but as divine Judge and King. Thus, the confusion in Islam arises from denying the full revelation of God’s nature in Christ.ReferencesThe Holy Quran,Surah al-Ahzab 33:40; Surah al-Nisa 4:159; Surah al-Zukhruf 43:61; Surah Ali ‘Imran 3:55.Sahih al-Bukhari, Hadith No. 3448;Sahih Muslim, Hadith No. 155.Ibn Kathir,Tafsir al-Qur’an al-Azim, Commentary on Surah 33:40.Al-Tabari,Jami‘ al-Bayan fi Tafsir al-Qur’an, Vol. 20.Al-Qurtubi,Al-Jami’ li Ahkam al-Qur’an, Commentary on Surah 33:40.John 1:1–14; Hebrews 1:1–3; Revelation 19:16 (Holy Bible).Shimba, Maxwell.Shimba Theological Institute Expository Commentaries on Islamic Theology(Orlando: STI Press, 2024).Expository Commentary by Dr. Maxwell ShimbaThe claim that Muhammad is the final prophet is incompatible with the Islamic affirmation of Jesus’ return. Either Jesus returns as a prophet, thereby nullifying Muhammad’s finality, or as divine Judge, thereby affirming His deity—both conclusions contradict core Islamic tenets. Islam, in its zeal to elevate Muhammad, traps itself in a theological paradox that only the divine revelation of Christ can resolve.",

According to this narration, Adam and Moses were engaged in an argument in which Moses blamed Adam for causing humanity to be expelled from Paradise. Adam, in response, claimed that his sin was predestinedforty years before his creation, thereby refuting Moses three times.This account raises profound theological, logical, and philosophical questions—especially when examined through the lens of divine justice, prophetic infallibility, and the nature of human responsibility. From a scholarly and academic perspective, this narration challenges both the coherence of Islamic predestination (qadar) and the moral consistency of divine judgment as presented in the Qur’an and Hadith literature.Text of the Hadith (Sahih al-Bukhari 6614)“Adam and Moses argued with each other. Moses said to Adam, ‘You are Adam whose mistake expelled you from Paradise and caused mankind to come down to the earth.’Adam said to him, ‘You are Moses whom Allah selected as His messenger and as one to whom He spoke directly. Yet you blame me for something which Allah had decreed for me before He created me?’So Adam confuted Moses three times.” (Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 8, Book 77, Hadith 6614).Central Theological Questions1. How did Adam know he was destined to error forty years before his creation?If Adam was not yet created, how could he have knowledge of divine decrees that predated his own existence? Islamic theology teaches that Adam was created as the first human being and received consciousness after being given life. Therefore, it is inconsistent to attribute to him awareness of events or decrees made before his existence.This leads to a crucial theological question:Was Adam’s knowledge revealed to him post-creation, or is this a constructed narrative to justify human sin through divine determinism?2. When did time, days, and years begin in Islamic cosmology?The hadith mentions “forty years” before Adam’s creation. But within Islamic teachings, time itself was created by Allah. If Adam’s error was decreedforty years before creation, this implies a measure of “years” before the creation of time—an internal contradiction.From a Biblical and Christian theological perspective,time began with creation itself(Genesis 1:1). In the Bible, Adam began to ageafterhis disobedience (Genesis 3:17–19), linking mortality directly to sin. Yet the hadith introduces a pre-creation chronology that has no coherent theological foundation.3. Why would Allah create Adam to err and then judge him?If Adam’s sin was predetermined, then judgment becomes morally problematic. How can divine justice hold Adam responsible for an act he was created to commit?This introduces a moral paradox in Islamic theology: if Allah decreed Adam’s fall, then Adam is innocent of moral failure. Conversely, if Adam acted freely, then divine predestination (qadar) cannot be absolute.Thus, the question remains:Is divine justice compatible with a pre-decreed sin?Extended Critical QuestionsIf Adam’s sin was written forty years before his creation, then does human repentance have any real meaning, or is it an illusion under divine predetermination?Does this hadith indirectly absolve Adam of moral responsibility, thereby nullifying the Islamic doctrine oftawbah(repentance)?How can a prophetic figure like Moses, who spoke directly with Allah, be “defeated” three times by Adam in a theological argument that contradicts divine justice?If Allah decreed Adam’s sin, did He also decree Satan’s rebellion? And if so, can Satan justifiably claim innocence under the same logic?Why does this hadith suggest debate and conflict between prophets, contradicting the Qur’anic portrayal of prophets as harmonious servants of Allah’s will (Qur’an 6:84–90)?Is this narration metaphorical or literal? If metaphorical, what divine purpose does it serve? If literal, how can two prophets from vastly different eras converse—does this suggest a temporal collapse that defies known cosmology?If Adam was aware of divine decrees before his creation, was he coexistent with Allah’s knowledge? Would that not imply an eternal consciousness in Adam, thereby contradictingtawhid(Islamic monotheism)?Why is Adam portrayed as “winning” an argument based on predestination, which seemingly undermines the moral accountability of all humankind?Does this hadith support fatalism rather than free will? If so, how can Islam maintain moral order and divine justice?Why is this narration not found in the Torah or the Bible, which describe Adam’s sin as an act of free disobedience rather than divine compulsion?Biblical ContrastIn Biblical theology, Adam’s transgression was not decreed but resulted from the free choice to disobey God’s command (Genesis 3:6–7). Divine justice in Scripture is based onresponsibility, notpredestination. Romans 5:12–19 explains that through one man’s disobedience, sin entered the world, yet redemption through Christ restores what was lost.In contrast, the hadith narrative undermines accountability by implying that Adam had no choice—thus making divine judgment appear arbitrary and unjust.ConclusionThe Adam–Moses debate inSahih al-Bukhari 6614raises serious philosophical and theological inconsistencies when examined critically. It challenges the nature of free will, divine justice, and prophetic harmony within Islamic belief. If Adam’s sin was decreed before creation, then sin, repentance, and divine judgment lose their moral and logical coherence.From a Biblical-theological standpoint, this hadith seems to transfer responsibility for human sin from man to God—a notion that conflicts with the scriptural portrayal of a just and holy Creator who grants humanity true moral agency.The question thus remains:Was Adam truly responsible for his sin—or was he merely fulfilling a divine script written before time began?By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute – Department of Comparative Theology and Apologetics",

    "full_content": "Title: An Academic Inquiry into the Muslim Prayer for Guidance: A Theological and Philosophical AnalysisBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis article explores a central paradox within Islamic devotional practice: the persistent plea for divine guidance found in the MuslimSalah(prayer), particularly in the recitation ofSurah Al-Fatihah—“Guide us to the straight path.” The study raises theological and philosophical questions regarding the implications of this repeated request among adherents who claim certainty in their faith and finality in the prophethood of Muhammad. The analysis aims to engage in a scholarly and interreligious debate concerning the concepts of assurance, faith, and divine direction in Islam.IntroductionIn Islam, Muslims are required to performSalahfive times daily, each beginning with the recitation ofSurah Al-Fatihah, the opening chapter of the Qur’an. A central petition within this chapter is the plea:“Ihdina al-siratal mustaqim”—“Guide us to the straight path” (Qur’an 1:6). This continual request raises theological questions: if Islam is believed to be thefinal and perfectrevelation of divine truth, and if the believer already possesses the complete path through Muhammad’s message, why must one continually ask for guidance? Does this repetition indicate a lack of spiritual assurance or internal uncertainty about salvation and truth?The Central Paradox of Islamic CertaintyIslam presents itself as the culmination of divine revelation, asserting that Muhammad is the “Seal of the Prophets” and that the Qur’an is the uncorrupted word of Allah. Yet, paradoxically, its adherents repeatedly ask for divine direction toward the right path.This contradiction provokes critical theological inquiry:If the Qur’an is thefinal revelationand Islam is thestraight path, why is further guidance necessary?If Muslims already walk in the light of truth, why the daily confession of needing direction?Does this prayer imply a lack of confidence in the sufficiency of Muhammad’s message?Or does it reveal a deeper recognition that human beings, even within Islam, are uncertain of divine favor and salvation?The Christian parallel, by contrast, presents believers as having assurance through Christ—“I am the way, the truth, and the life” (John 14:6)—not needing toask for the way, but rather towalk in it.The Psychological Dimension of Repetitive SupplicationFrom a psychological and existential perspective, continual pleading for guidance may reveal an underlying sense of spiritual insecurity. In Islamic theology, salvation is not guaranteed, and Allah’s judgment remains ultimately unknowable. Therefore, the daily plea, “Show us the straight path,” might be viewed as an expression of fear and uncertainty rather than confidence in divine relationship.This raises further philosophical questions:Can true faith coexist with perpetual uncertainty?If divine guidance must be continually requested, does it imply that Allah has not yet provided a complete revelation?Does the repetitive structure of the prayer suggest a mechanical or ritualized form of devotion devoid of relational assurance with God?Why is there no final rest or peace in knowing one already stands in the “straight path”?Theological ImplicationsIslamic scholars argue thatSurah Al-Fatihahexpresses humility before Allah and continual dependence on His mercy. However, this explanation does not fully resolve the underlying tension. In Christian theology, humility is expressed in thanksgiving for already-received salvation, not in repetitive uncertainty. The Apostle Paul wrote,“Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace”(Hebrews 4:16), highlighting confidence in divine acceptance—something seemingly absent in the Islamic framework of guidance.If Muslims already believe Muhammad’s revelation is thefinal truth, then logically, there should be no need for continued petitions for direction. The perpetual repetition of this plea suggests that even the faithful Muslim remains unsure whether he truly walks in divine favor.Comparative Theological ReflectionA comparison between Islamic and Biblical theology reveals a critical distinction:In Islam, believers seek to find the straight path through obedience, ritual, and guidance-seeking.In Christianity, believers walkonthe path because Christ Himselfisthe path.This distinction underscores the relational difference between knowingaboutGod andknowingGod personally. Christianity emphasizes assurance and intimate fellowship with the Creator, while Islam emphasizes submission and uncertainty about divine acceptance.ConclusionThe Muslim prayer for guidance, repeated five times daily, opens an essential space for academic and theological dialogue. It invites questions that challenge the internal consistency of Islamic theology:If the Muslim already possesses divine truth, why seek it repeatedly?If Allah has already revealed the straight path, why does the believer still plead to be shown it?Does this imply that Muhammad’s revelation was incomplete or that divine truth in Islam is perpetually uncertain?Such questions do not seek to mock Islamic devotion but to encourage deep theological reflection on the nature of faith, assurance, and relationship with the Divine. A religion confident in its revelation would not need to plead continually for what it claims to already possess.ReferencesThe Qur’an,Surah Al-Fatihah(1:1–7).The Qur’an,Surah Al-Baqarah(2:2) – “This is the Book about which there is no doubt, a guidance for those conscious of Allah.”The Bible, John 14:6 – “I am the way, the truth, and the life.”The Bible, Hebrews 4:16 – “Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace.”Al-Ghazali,Ihya’ Ulum al-Din, Vol. 1 – Discussion on prayer and divine guidance.Watt, W.

After thinking for a long time, Khadija (Radhiya Llahu ‘anha) reached the decision to express to Muhammad the affection she had for him. “Even though this feels like a dream, it is still possible,” she thought. “But who can deliver my request to him? And will Muhammad accept me despite my old age?” she whispered to herself with concern.As she was lost in these thoughts, there was a knock at the door.“Who is knocking?”“It is I, your sister Halah.”Khadija welcomed her sister:“Ahlan wa sahlan, welcome Halah.”Halah replied,“Thank you, Khadija. How are you all doing?”Khadija said,“We are fine, but this sudden visit surprises me.”Halah responded,“I simply came to check on you.”Khadija looked at her intently,“To check on me only? You sound unusual today. Are you hiding something from me?”Halah observed her sister carefully and said:“Not at all. I am hiding nothing. It’s just that earlier today I fell asleep and dreamt of you walking as though you were lost in a dark path, and behind you a voice kept saying,‘Go forward, go forward.’I felt I should come and check on you, though I do not know the meaning of the dream.”Lady Khadija smiled slightly and said,“The truth is, I have been deeply troubled in my thoughts these days.”Halah asked,“What are you thinking about? You live in such abundance and comfort.”Khadija replied,“I am thinking about Muhammad, my sister. I think about his qualities and his charm—none among the Quraysh men can match him.”Halah asked,“And where do these thoughts lead you?”Khadija answered,“I want him to marry me.”Halah said,“Then ask him to marry you.”Lady Khadija responded timidly,“I fear he might reject me because of my old age. He is young, and I am old.”Halah encouraged her:“You too, my sister, are a woman of wealth and great respect.”Khadija replied,“But look at my age. I have been married twice already, while he is a young man of twenty–five who has never married. How would Muhammad accept to marry a woman nearly the age of his mother, who has married twice before, and who has children?”Halah asked,“And who first told you about Muhammad, enough for you to trust him with your wealth for business?”Khadija answered,“My friend Nafisa.”Halah said,“Then let that same Nafisa present your request to him.”She then bid farewell to her sister and left.Given that Muhammad was an orphan who lived under the care of various people, it is clear his life lacked stability. Undoubtedly, like any young man, he would long for a permanent home. For this reason, the request of the elderly, wealthy toothless Khadija appeared to him as an opportunity.Muhammad found no alternative but to accept the proposal of the wealthy elderly woman. Yet in his heart, there was always a certain inclination. When we look atSahih Bukhari, Volume 3, Book 34, Number 310, we find that one day Muhammad asked Jarir ibn Abdullah:“Have you got married?”He replied:“Yes.”Muhammad asked:“A virgin or a matron?”He answered:“I married a matron.”Muhammad said:“Why did you not marry a virgin, so you may play with her and she may play with you?”Meaning:“You married?”“Yes.”“A virgin or an older woman?”“An older woman.”“Why did you not marry a virgin who would play with you and you play with her?”What does this imply?It implies that Muhammad’s marriage to Khadija, the elderly toothless woman, was not out of deep affection or desire. Rather, life circumstances compelled him to accept her. Muhammad preferred young girls—those he could “play with” and who could “play with him.”This is why the death of Khadija created a rare opportunity—an opportunity he had long desired—to marry little girls such asAisha, who wasonly six years old.Questions for Reflection(i)Why did Muhammad not have genuine affection for Lady Khadija?(ii)Why was Muhammad drawn to Khadija’s wealth?(iii)Did Muhammad benefit from Khadija’s death in order to fulfill his desire to marry little girls?(iv)Why was Muhammad only able to marry many women after Khadija died?",

They continue to hold tightly to their views concerning the Divinity of Jesus. The root of all the questions Muslims ask about the Lord Jesus begins the moment Jesus took on human flesh. At first glance, this act may seem to diminish His divine authority. However, from my understanding, this act never lowered His authority—rather, it concealed it for the following reason:God Once Revealed Himself Openly—and Humans PerishedFollow this:Exodus 19:20–21–The LORD descended upon Mount Sinai… The LORD called Moses up the mountain… Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go down and warn the people lest they break through to gaze at the LORD, and many of them perish.”The key question:In what form must God appear so that human beings can endure His presence?Answer:He must come in a form thatcovers the terrifying intensity of His divine authorityfrom sinful human beings.When He appears in human form, He experiences hunger, tears, walking, sleeping, and all human conditions. This is why Jesus is100% God and 100% man.Follow:Exodus 33:18,20– Moses said, “Show me Your glory.” God replied, “You cannot see My face, for no one can see Me and live.”This fundamental reason explains why Jesus took on human flesh through Mary. The body of JesuscoveredHis majestic divine authority—it would not have been wise to reveal it fully, lest humanity perish instead of being saved. In other words, God (Jesus) used His human body as a means to approach His servants—just as God once revealed Himself in a burning bush according to the Qur’an.“Humanity Is God’s Communication Method With His Servants”Qur’an 42:51– God communicates with His servants through:InspirationFrom behind aveil(a covering of His authority)The Qur’an mentions theveilas an instrument through which God speaks to humans. This veil is a covering that hides the full reality of God. Thus, God at certain times chooses to reveal Himselffrom behind a veil.What is the veil according to the Bible?Hebrews 10:20–“through the veil, that is, His flesh.”In the Bible, the veil represents thebody of the Lord Jesus. His human flesh is the medium of communication between God and man—a covering that makes it possible for humanity to encounter Him without being destroyed.Supporting Scriptures:1 Timothy 3:16–“God was manifested in the flesh.”Hebrews 10:5–“A body You prepared for Me.”Philippians 2:7–“He made Himself of no reputation… being made in the likeness of men.”Why Is He Called the Son If He Is God?Jesus’ title“Son of God”originates from His action of taking on human flesh.John 1:14–“The Word became flesh… the glory as of the only Son from the Father.”This verse presents two great truths:He became fleshHe is called the Son from HeavenThe ReasonJesus’ mission to save humanity required Him not only tocover His divine glorybut also tochange His authoritative titletemporarily.A Simple IllustrationWater can change into different forms. When it freezes, we no longer call itwater—we call itice.Question:Is ice not water?Answer:It is water, only temporarily transformed in nature—and it will eventually return to its original state.Likewise, Jesus was called the Son because He temporarily took on a form suitable for redeeming humanity.He became “ice” from “water”—He became the Son from the divine essence solely for the purpose of salvation.His divine essence remained unchanged.Further Biblical Testimony of Jesus’ DivinityJohn 14:7–10–“Whoever has seen Me has seen the Father.”Titus 2:13–“Our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ.”John 20:28– Thomas said,“My Lord and my God!”Dear beloved, I believe your fears and doubts concerning this subject have been addressed and cleared through this analysis. Now make your decision today and rebuild your faith in the divine authority of the Lord Jesus as revealed in Scripture.ConclusionJesus is God, and therefore anyone who desires to go to Heaven can only do so throughJesus Christ alone.Acts 4:12–“There is no other name under Heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved.”",

Eventually, they were overpowered andsurrendered.Muhammad chose one of his companions,Sa’d ibn Mu’adh, to determine what should happen after Banu Qurayza surrendered.Sa’d ibn Mu’adh ruled that:all the men of Banu Qurayza should be executed,their property confiscated,their women and children taken as captives.Muhammadacceptedthis ruling.So what happened to those who were sentenced to death?We read inAl-Tabari 8:35andIbn Ishaq 464:“The Jews were made to come down, and Allah's Messenger imprisoned them. Then the Prophet went out into the marketplace of Medina, and hehad trenches dugin it. He sent for the Jewish men and had thembeheadedin those trenches. They were brought out to him in batches. They numbered800 to 900 boys and men.”Meaning:The Jews were brought, and the Messenger of Allah imprisoned them. Then the Prophet went to the marketplace of Medina and ordered trenches to be dug. He commanded that the Jewish men be brought to him, and he ordered theirbeheadingin those trenches. They were brought to him in groups. Their total number reached800 to 900 men and boys.This is the Muhammad whom Muslims claim is the beloved of Allah and theperfect exampleto follow.Our Questions Are These:Who are you to say Boko Haram are not “true Muslims”because they kidnapped 200 schoolgirls, when Muhammad himself captured an entire tribe?Who are you to say ISIS are not “true Muslims”when they also dig trenches and kill people in them—just as Muhammad did?Or is the difference simply that they use guns instead of swords?Our Muslim brothers will arguethat Banu Qurayza “broke a treaty,” and therefore they deserved such treatment.But this argument collapses for one simple reason:If you meet a professor who refuses to teach and says,“Why should I teach when the students themselves are not teaching me?”—would you not think something is seriously wrong with him?You Muslims claim thatyou have the word of God.You claim thatnon-Muslims are astraybecause they do not know God’s ways.So if someone outside your faith does wrong,aren’t you the professor who is supposed to teach him?If you behave exactly like the one you call a “disbeliever,” what do you have that is different?Do you expect the non-believer to act righteously first so thatyoumay act righteously afterward?How absurd!Therefore, we maintain this:If Muhammad is truly the model of Islam, then ISIS and Boko Haram are indeed excellent Muslims.But Jesus Is the Only Way to LifeThen Jesus spoke to them again, saying, “I am the light of the world.Whoever follows Me shall not walk in darkness,but will have the light of life.”(John 8:12)Reflect.Take action.",

    "full_content": "Helel, Lucifer, and Halal: A Philological and Theological Inquiry into Claims of Linguistic RelationshipBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractIn recent years, some polemical discussions have attempted to draw a connection between the Hebrew termhêlēl(הֵילֵל) in Isaiah 14:12—later rendered asLuciferin Latin—and the Arabic termhalāl(حلال), which in Islam denotes what is lawful, particularly with reference to food and ritual slaughter. This article offers a critical, academic examination of these claims by exploring the linguistic, historical, and theological foundations of each term. Although superficial phonetic similarities may prompt comparison, the evidence demonstrates that these words arise from entirely different linguistic roots, semantic fields, and historical contexts. Nevertheless, this article investigateswhysuch comparisons emerge,what assumptions they rely on, andhow such claims function within interreligious debates.1. IntroductionThe idea thathalal—Islamic ritual slaughter—derives from, or is conceptually related to, the Hebrewhêlēl, the word underlying the LatinLucifer, appears frequently in polemical religious discourse. Proponents suggest that because the words sound alike, they share a common origin or meaning. Some even argue that halal practices are therefore connected to worship of a figure associated with evil.From the standpoint of Hebrew, Arabic, philology, and biblical studies, this claim requires dispassionate academic scrutiny. The goal of this article isnotto defend Islamic practice, nor to promote Christian polemics, but to analyze the linguistic and theological foundations of the claim and clarify what the biblical and Semitic data actually allow us to conclude.2. The Hebrew TermHelel(הֵילֵל) in Isaiah 14:122.1 Meaning and ContextThe wordhêlēlappears only once in the Hebrew Bible (Isaiah 14:12). It derives from the roothll (הלל), which carries the meaningto shine. The phrasehêlēl ben shaḥartranslates to“shining one, son of the dawn.”2.2 Literary Purpose in IsaiahIsaiah 14 is a poetic taunt against the king of Babylon. The prophet mocks the king’s pride by comparing his arrogance to that of the morning star rising in the sky—only to be cast down.2.3 Later Christian InterpretationBecause the Latin Vulgate translatedhêlēlasLucifer(“light-bringer”), later Christian tradition associated this fall-from-heaven imagery with Satan. But in its original Hebrew context, the term referred metaphorically to a human king, not a supernatural being.3. The Arabic TermHalal(حلال)3.1 Meaning and UsageHalālin Arabic means“lawful, permissible”according to Islamic law. It derives from the Semitic rootḥ-l-l (حلل), meaningto untie, to make lawful, to permit.In Islamic jurisprudence, it refers to:lawful foodlawful conductlawful economic transactions3.2 Ritual SlaughterDhabīḥah, the Islamic method of slaughter, is commonly described as “halal meat.” The termhalaldoesnotoriginally mean sacrifice; it refers to permissibility.**4.Linguistic Comparison:HelelandHalal4.1 Different Root LettersDespite superficial similarity in English transliteration, the words come fromentirely different roots:WordLanguageRootMeaninghêlēl(הֵילֵל)Hebrewh-l-l (הלל)to shinehalāl(حلال)Arabicḥ-l-l (حلل)to make lawfulHebrewh(ה) is not the Arabicḥ(ح), which is a deep pharyngeal sound. The roots differ in meaning and structure.These two words arenotcognates, nor historically related.4.2 Semitic Languages and “False Friends”Semitic languages often produce words that look similar but are unrelated. These are calledfalse cognates. Examples:Hebrewkadosh(holy) vs. Arabicqadash(to curse)Hebrewmelek(king) vs. Arabicmalak(angel)Thus, similarity in sound does not establish a linguistic relationship.5. Why Then Do Some Suggest a Connection?Even though the linguistic evidence is clear, the comparison persists. Several factors explain this:5.1 Phonetic Similarity in English TranslationWhen Hebrew הֵילֵל (hêlēl) is transliterated as “helel” and Arabic حلال (halāl) is transliterated as “halal,” the spellings look similar. This resemblance disappears when the original scripts and phonetics are considered.5.2 Confusion Between Hebrewhalal(הלל – “to praise”) and Arabichalal(حلال – “lawful”)A separate Hebrew roothalal(הלל), meaning“to praise”, is unrelated to Arabichalāl(“lawful”), but their English spellings create confusion.5.3 Theological Interpretation vs. Linguistic EvidenceSome Christians argue:IfLucifer(Helel) is a fallen angel,and if “halal food” is ritual slaughter,then the similarity in sound might suggest spiritual connection.Academically, this falls underthe fallacy of etymological association—the assumption that similar-sounding words imply shared origin or spiritual meaning.6. Theological Evaluation of the ClaimEven if one rejects Islamic theology, no biblical, historical, or linguistic evidence supports the claim that:“Halal comes from helel, therefore halal food is linked to Lucifer.”6.1 Scriptural SilenceNeither the Bible nor Jewish tradition connectshelelwith food sacrifice.Neither the Qur’an nor Islamic tradition connectshalalwith heavenly beings.6.2 Historical DevelopmentThe termhalālpredates Islam and is found in early Arabic usage meaning “lawful,” unrelated to celestial terminology.6.3 Logical ImplicationIf phonetic similarity were enough to establish theological meaning, then:EnglishsunandsonHebrew’or(light) and Arabic’awr(shame)Latinmalum(apple) andmalum(evil)Would also be considered spiritually connected. They are not.7. Academic ConclusionThis study demonstrates:Helel(הֵילֵל) in Hebrew means“shining one”, referring poetically to the king of Babylon.Luciferis a later Latin interpretive rendering, not the original Hebrew meaning.Halal(حلال) in Arabic means“lawful/permitted”and hasno etymological connectiontohêlēl.Any proposed theological relationship isnon-linguistic, based on modern polemical interpretation rather than historical or philological evidence.Thus, claims that Islamichalalderives from Hebrewhêlēl(Lucifer) arelinguistically unfounded,historically unsustainable, andtheologically constructed rather than textually supported.Nevertheless, such claimsshould be studied academicallybecause they reveal how language, religion, and polemics interact in contemporary debates.",

    "full_content": "Why Did Aisha Give Her Flower to Safwan Ibn Al-Muattal?By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteThis subject remains one of the most troubling issues within the Muslim community. When the “Mother of the Believers,” Aisha, engages in an act that raises shame and countless unanswered questions, one must ask:Did Aisha truly love Muhammad?Or had she already been accustomed to questionable conduct from the beginning? Personally, many concerning questions arise in my mind—questions that demand careful investigation. Did Aisha grow tired of Muhammad and decide to give her “flower” to Safwan Ibn Al-Muattal? And why did she refuse to bear Muhammad a child? These are legitimate queries.Ibn Hisham, citing Ibn Ishaq, narrates that Aisha was caught committingZINAA (sexual intercourse)with Safwan Ibn Al-Muattal, one of Muhammad’s companions—what is widely known as theSafwan Incident. This occurred in Madinah, and the news spread throughout the entire city, forcing the Prophet of Allah to return Aisha to her parents’ home in humiliation.Ali, who was both Muhammad's cousin and the husband of his daughter Fatimah, advised Muhammad todivorce Aishato hide the great embarrassment caused by being caught in an act of adultery.The Muslims of Madinah, led by Abdullah bin Ubayy, publicly declared that Lady Aisha (RA) had committed adultery with Safwan. When Muhammad heard this, he gathered his companions and consulted them on what should be done. Some advised him to divorce her. The Prophet then visited Aisha and told her:“If you are innocent, Allah will forgive you; but if not, seek forgiveness from your Lord.”Aisha cried uncontrollably and asked her parents for forgiveness for theimmoralityshe had committed with Safwan, but her parents remained speechless.ReferencesIbn Sa’ad,Al-Tabaqat Al-Kubra, vol. 8 (Arabic)Ibn Hisham,Al-Sira Al-Nabawiyya(Arabic)Dr. Sami Alrabaa,Karen in Saudi ArabiaSahih al-Bukhari, Chapter of Washing, narrated by Anas (Arabic)Al-Lulu’ wal-Marjan fima Ittafaqa Alayhi Al-Shaikhan, Hadith No. 168, 173 (Arabic)Did Aisha Love Muhammad?Aisha was the daughter of Abu Bakr. Her mother was Umm Ruman according toAl-Tabari, vol. 9, p.129. She was married to Muhammad at the age ofsix (6)and moved into his house for consummation at the age ofnine (9)—a complete child marriage. (Bukhari vol. 7, book 62, hadith 88; Muslim vol. 2, book 8, hadith 3309–3311).It is possible that Aisha’s alleged involvement with Safwan was influenced by the fact that shenever truly consented to marrying Muhammad, but merely obeyed her parents’ wishes. This raises deeper psychological and moral questions surrounding her marriage and her personal agency.Aisha’s Questionable CharacterAisha narrated:“The Prophet used to screen me with his garment while I watched the Ethiopians playing in the courtyard of the mosque. (I continued watching) until I was satisfied.”This describes anine-year-old child, not yet at puberty, watching grown men performing entertainment. One can observe how a young girl might have become exposed to or accustomed to inappropriate environments that could shape her future conduct. (Bukhari vol. 7, book 62, chapter 115, hadith 163).Critical QuestionsCan a nine-year-old girl feel entertained by watching Ethiopian men performing in a mosque courtyard?Did Aisha already possess tendencies toward immoral behavior, perhaps even a form of early promiscuity, that made her attracted to other men besides Muhammad?Why did Aisha “give her flower” to Safwan Ibn Al-Muattal?What emotional, psychological, or marital factors pushed her into this scandalous situation?",

However, a careful reading of the Qur’an itself reveals the opposite. The Qur’an repeatedly affirms the authority, authenticity, and divine origin of the earlier Scriptures—the Torah, the Psalms, and the Gospel.Consider the following Qur’anic passages:“O you who believe! Believe in Allah, His Messenger, the Book He has revealed to His Messenger, and the Scriptures He revealed before.”(Al-Nisā 4:136)Again, the Qur’an states:“If you are in doubt about what We have revealed to you, then ask those who read the Scripture before you.”(Yūnus 10:94)In these verses, the Qur’an explicitly confirms the existence and reliability of the earlier Scripturesat the time Muhammad was speaking. If the Torah, Psalms, and Gospel had already been corrupted, why would Allah direct believers to consult them?Let us assume, for the sake of argument, that what the Qur’an asserts is true.By the time Muhammad uttered these statements in the 7th century (around A.D. 600):TheOld Testamentwas alreadythousands of years old.TheNew Testamenthad already been in circulation forhundreds of years.With this historical reality in mind, here are critical questions for our Muslim brothers and sisters—questions that help determine whether the Bible was corrupted or whether the misunderstanding lies elsewhere.Key Questions Every Muslim Must Consider1. Jeremiah 8:8 and the Claim of CorruptionMuslims often citeJeremiah 8:8to argue that the Bible was corrupted.But ask yourself:Was Jeremiah 8:8 already in existence when Allah instructed believers to trust the previous Scriptures (Al-Nisā 4:136)?If the Qur’an affirmed the Scriptures in Muhammad’s day, does this not imply that Jeremiah 8:8 wasnotevidence of corruption?2. Why Command People to Consult “A Corrupted Book”?If the Bible was already corrupted by A.D. 600, why did Allah instruct Muhammad and his followers to seek clarification from “the People of the Book” (Yūnus 10:94)?Would Allah direct believers to bemisguided?3. Did Allah Expect Jews and Christians of Muhammad’s Time to Rise from the Dead?If the texts were corrupted long before Islam, was Allah telling Muslims to consult Moses, Jesus’ apostles, and the ancient prophets—who were already dead?This interpretation is absurd and contradicts the context.4. The Only Logical ConclusionIf Muslims were indeed instructed to consult Jews and Christiansliving at the time of Muhammad, then the implication is clear:As of the 7th century, the Bible was still authentic and trustworthy.Otherwise, Allah would never have directed anyone to it.5. When Then Did the Corruption Happen?If Muslims insist the Bible is corrupted today, they must also admit:Any alleged corruption must have occurredafterthe 7th century,because the Qur’an affirms the Scriptures thatexisted at that time.But here lies the problem:Today we possess Bible manuscripts that predate Islam byhundredsand eventhousandsof years. These ancient manuscripts match the Bible Christians read today.ConclusionThere areBiblical manuscripts in existence today that were written long before A.D. 600—the same Scriptures the Qur’an commands Muslims to believe. These manuscripts prove that the Bible has not been altered.The decision now rests with you.If you choose to be misled, that choice is personal.But truth remains unchanged:Jesus alone is the Way, the Truth, and the Life.Reflect.Examine the evidence.And take the step toward truth.",

The Qur'an Teaches That Every Nation Has Its Own MessengerSurah Yunus 10:47states:“Every nation has its messenger.”If every nation wasindividuallyassigned a prophet, then Muhammad cannot logically be the prophet ofallnations.2. Prophets Are Sent in Their Own Language to Their Own PeopleSurah Ibrahim 14:4:“We have not sent a messenger except in the language of his people.”Muhammad spokeArabicand belonged toan Arab tribe.Thus his \"people\" are Arabs — not Africans, not Indians, not Europeans.3. Earlier Nations Already Received Their MessengersSurah An-Nahl 16:36:“We certainly sent a messenger to every nation…”The Qur'an claims Africans, Indians, and Persians had prophetsbefore.Thus Muhammad cannot be their prophet.4. The Qur'an Explicitly Declares Different Shari’as for Different PeoplesSurah Al-Mā’idah 5:48:“To each of you We prescribed a law and a method.”Different peoples = different laws = different messengers.5. Muhammad Sent to a People Who Had Never Received a Messenger BeforeSurah As-Sajdah 32:3:“So that you may warn a people to whom no warner has come before you.”This describesArab pagans, not the whole world.6. Muhammad Was One Among Many Regional MessengersSurah Ya-Sin 36:6:“To warn a people whose forefathers were not warned.”Again—Arabs only.7. The Qur'an Distinguishes Between “Two Former Nations” and Muhammad’s Own NationSurah Al-An’ām 6:156–157:Here Allah speaks toa new nationdifferent from the “two nations” (Jews and Christians) who already had scriptures.Who is this new nation?The Arabs.8. The Qur’an Is a Book in “Clear Arabic” Sent to an Arab ProphetSurah Ash-Shu’ara 26:195:“In a clear Arabic language.”Then Allah adds:“If We had revealed it to a non-Arab… they would not have believed.”Thus the Qur'an isnot universal.9. Muhammad Sent to “The Mother of Cities (Mecca) and its Surrounding Regions”Surah Al-An’ām 6:92;Surah Ash-Shūrā 42:7:“To warn the Mother of Cities and those around it.”“Those around it” cannot meanthe whole world; it refers to nearby Arab regions.10. Qur'an Revealed in Arabicfor ArabsIf the Qur'an were forall humanity, why restrict it toArabic only?No universal scripture demands one ethnic language.Conclusion of Scholar ABased solely on Qur’anic evidence, Muhammad isnota prophet for all humanity.He is the prophetfor the Arabs only, and the Qur'an istheir regional scripture.**Scholar B (Universality):\"Muhammad was sent to all mankind.\"**Scholar B acknowledges the verses cited but provides interpretive arguments common in Islamic theology.1. The Qur'an Uses Gradual RevelationMuslims argue that early verses emphasize Arabs because Muhammad wasstartingwith his own people.2. Universality Claimed ExplicitlyTwo verses are commonly cited:Surah Al-Anbiya 21:107:“We have sent you as a mercy to the worlds.”Surah Saba 34:28:“We have sent you to all mankind.”These verses form the basis for universality.3. “Language” Does Not Limit AudienceThey argue: Moses spoke Hebrew but Jews still believe his message is universal in moral terms.4. Arabs Were the First Audience, Not the Only AudienceMuslims say the Qur’an began with Arabs but extended globally through dawah.5. “Every Nation Has a Messenger” Indicates Continuity, Not ExclusivityThus Muhammad fulfills earlier prophets and unifies humanity.REBUTTALSScholar A Responds✔ Verse 34:28 Does Not Override 10:47, 14:4, 16:36, 42:7The universal claim contradicts earlier foundational principles:Every nation has its prophet.Prophets are sent to their own people.Each nation has its own law.These cannot harmonize with a universal prophet.✔ “Mercy to the Worlds” Does Not Mean “Messenger to the Worlds”It is apoetic honorific, not a doctrinal definition.✔ A truly universal message cannot be locked in one ethnic languageWhy is the Qur'an:eternally Arabicuntranslatable (translations are not Qur’ans)limited to Arab culture, law, and context?✔ The Qur'an repeatedly points only to ArabsNot once does it name Africans, Persians, Chinese, or Europeans as part of Muhammad’s mandate.Scholar B RespondsScholar B appeals to Islamic consensus:Muslim scholars historically agree that Muhammad is universal.The Qur'an was revealed in Arabic simply because Muhammad was Arab.But Scholar B cannot negate the explicit limiting verses.CLOSING STATEMENTSScholar A (Exclusivity)The Qur’an itself—consistently, repeatedly, and explicitly—defines:Muhammad = Messenger to Arabs.Each nation = its own messenger.Qur'an = Arabic message for Arabic speakers.Mission field = Mecca and its regional tribes.No verse can overturn this structural doctrine.Therefore:Muhammad is not the prophet of the world.He is the prophet of the Arabs.Scholar B (Universality)Muslim theology relies heavily on later interpretations and hadith, not the explicit Qur’anic text.But the Islamic consensus still insists on Muhammad’s universal mission.FINAL VERDICT (Moderator)A textual analysis of the Qur'anas it reads literallystrongly supports Scholar A’s position:The Qur’an repeatedly limits Muhammad’s mission to:His peopleHis languageHis regionHis tribeHis cultureHis historical contextUniversal claims appearlaterand arecontradictedby foundational principles.",

But there is adifferencebetween feeling fear because you have seen something supernatural, and feeling fear because the being hasgrabbed you by the neck and pressed you until you lose your breath.Let us look at the TRUE Gabriel as revealed in Scripture:“And he said to me, ‘O Daniel, you greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak to you, and stand upright; for I have now been sent to you.’ While he was speaking this word to me, I stood trembling. Then he said to me, ‘Fear not, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your heart to understand and humbled yourself before your God, your words were heard; and I have come because of your words.’”—Daniel 10:11–12“And the LORD answered the angel who talked with me with good and comforting words.”—Zechariah 1:13“When Zachariah saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him. But the angel said to him, ‘Do not be afraid, Zachariah, for your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John.’”—Luke 1:12–13“And he came to her and said, ‘Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you.’ But she was greatly troubled at the saying and tried to discern what sort of greeting this might be. And the angel said to her, ‘Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.’”—Luke 1:28–30“And in the same region there were shepherds out in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were filled with great fear. And the angel said to them, ‘Fear not, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy which shall be for all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.’”—Luke 2:8–11This is the Gabriel I know.This is the true Gabriel.This is the Gabriel of heaven.But what about Jibril, whom Islam claims is the same Gabriel of the Bible?We read inSahih Bukhari, Vol. 1, Book 1, Hadith 3:“The Prophet added, ‘The angel caught me forcefully and pressed me so hard that I could not bear it anymore.’”Meaning:“The angel grabbed me violently and squeezed me so strongly that I could no longer breathe.”The one who came to Muhammad:Was NOT Gabriel.Was NOT!Not even once!The Lord Jesus says:“I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.”—John 8:12Do not be deceived.Reflect deeply.Take action.",

    "full_content": "A Critical Examination of Muhammad’s Death Rites in Relation to Islamic Normative PracticeBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIslam defines itself as a religion grounded in the teachings, actions, and example (Sunnah) of the Prophet Muhammad. For Muslims, Muhammad functions as the normative model (al-uswah al-hasanah) whose life and conduct provide the standard for imitation. Consequently, the consistency between Muhammad’s own life—and particularly his death—and the ritual obligations Islam prescribes is an important subject of theological inquiry.This article critically evaluates three areas traditionally associated with Islamic ritual and prophetic exemplariness:circumcision,post-mortem bodily procedures, andburial in a shroud. The aim is to assess whether Muhammad’s death adhered to Islamic norms and, by extension, whether his example can be considered universally prescriptive within Islam.1. The Question of CircumcisionCircumcision (khitān) is widely practiced within Muslim communities and is often regarded as a sign of religious identity. However, the Qur’an containsno explicit statementaffirming that Muhammad himself was circumcised, nor does it mandate circumcision as a divine command. Islamic sources differ significantly on this matter, and no universally accepted textual proof exists to confirm that Muhammad underwent the procedure.Given Muhammad’s central role as a model for the Muslim community, the absence of clear evidence raises an important theological question:Can an act be considered universally obligatory for Muslims if it was not demonstrably performed by Muhammad himself?2. Post-Mortem Procedures: The Issue of Bodily ExpressionIslamic jurisprudence identifies specific rites for handling the body of a deceased Muslim. Among these practices—derived from fiqh literature—is the expectation that the body be washed and that the abdomen be gently pressed to expel any remaining waste. This procedure is considered necessary to ensure ritual purity before burial.Sources describing the final illness and death of Muhammad donotindicate that this procedure was applied to his body. If every Muslim corpse must undergo such ritual preparation, the absence of this practice in the Prophet’s own case presents a theological inconsistency within Islamic ritual law.It raises the broader question of whether Islamic funerary requirements are universally binding, or whether prophetic exemption exists without explicit scriptural justification.3. Burial in a Shroud: Deviations from Normative Islamic PracticeIslamic funeral rites specify that a deceased Muslim must be:WashedWrapped in a funerary shroud (kafan)Perfumed three timesBuried after the funeral prayerThese rites are presented as religious obligations upon the Muslim community. Exceptions only apply to specific cases—such as an individual who dies while in a state ofihramduring pilgrimage, who must not be perfumed or have the head covered, as indicated in authentic reports narrated by Ibn ‘Abbās and recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim.However, reports describing Muhammad’s own burial practices indicate irregularities regarding the application of the shroud and the perfuming process. These deviations from standard Islamic funerary prescriptions invite further examination regarding prophetic exemplary status and the construction of Islamic ritual norms.Conclusion: Reconsidering the Claim of Prophetic ExemplarityIslamic theology presents Muhammad as the ideal model for conduct, belief, and practice. Yet the inconsistencies between:the ritual expectations placed upon ordinary Muslims, andthe recorded circumstances of Muhammad’s own death and burialraise legitimate academic questions about the coherence of prophetic exemplariness within Islamic doctrine.If Muhammad was neither demonstrably circumcised, nor subjected to standard Islamic post-mortem procedures, nor buried strictly in accordance with Islamic funerary laws, then the claim that he serves as the comprehensive normative model requires reevaluation.This analysis does not seek to undermine personal faith commitments, but to engage critically with the internal logic of Islamic ritual practice and its theological foundations.",

    "full_content": "Jesus Is the Real One: A Critical Theological Analysis of the Islamic Isa bin MaryamBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis article examines the theological divergence between the Biblical Jesus Christ—the eternal Son of God—and the Islamic figure known asIsa bin Maryam. While both traditions claim reverence for Jesus, their portrayals differ radically in identity, mission, and eschatological role. Through biblical analysis and comparative theology, this paper argues that the Islamic Isa represents a constructed figure fundamentally inconsistent with the historical and biblical Jesus, and aligns more closely with the New Testament warnings concerning false Christs and end-time deception.1. IntroductionThroughout Christian history, the identity of Jesus Christ has stood at the center of faith, doctrine, and salvation. Islam, however, presents an alternative figure calledIsa bin Maryam, whom it identifies as a prophet, denies His divine Sonship, and predicts His return to establish Islamic rule. This theological conflict raises a crucial question:Is the Isa of Islam the same Jesus revealed in Scripture?This paper argues that the answer is unequivocallyno. Instead, the Islamic Isa fits the biblical warnings of a counterfeit Christ—one who denies the fundamental truths of the Gospel.2. The Biblical Portrait of Jesus ChristThe New Testament presents Jesus as:The eternal Word and Creator(John 1:1–3)The only begotten Son of God(John 3:16)The incarnate Lord and Savior(Matthew 1:23; Titus 2:13)The Judge of all nations(Acts 17:31)The returning King of kings(Revelation 19:11–16)These attributes are non-negotiable within Christian theology. To deny His Sonship or divine identity is to reject the very essence of Christian revelation.3. The Islamic Isa: A Theological DepartureIslamic doctrine, as found in the Qur’an and Hadith, presents Isa as:Not the Son of God (Qur’an 5:116; 112:1–4)Not crucified or resurrected (Qur’an 4:157)A prophet subordinate to MuhammadA figure who will return to destroy crosses, abolish Christianity, kill the swine, and convert the world to IslamThis portrayal is incompatible with the biblical narrative. The Isa of Islam rejects every cornerstone of Christianity—atonement, resurrection, Sonship, and divinity. The two figures cannot be harmonized.4. False Christs and Biblical WarningsJesus warned His disciples thatfalse Christswould arise to mislead even the elect (Matthew 24:23–25). The apostle Paul similarly cautioned that a deceptive figure would appear before Christ’s return—one who exalts himself against the true God (2 Thessalonians 2:3–4).The Islamic Isa fits these warnings precisely:He denies Jesus’ divine identityHe overturns central Christian doctrinesHe demands global submission to a religious system that rejects the true GospelThus, the Isa of Islam is not simply a different interpretation of Jesus; he is atheological counterfeit.5. Isa and the Antichrist ParadigmAn important theological observation emerges when comparing Islamic eschatology with the Bible:Islam’s “Dajjal” resembles the Jesus of Scripture:Performs miraclesClaims divine authorityRules from JerusalemIslam’s “Isa” resembles the biblicalAntichrist:Denies Jesus’ divinityOpposes Christian doctrineSeeks to destroy Christian faithThis inversion creates a profound eschatological conflict:The true Christ of Christianity is portrayed as the villain in Islamic eschatology, while the false Christ becomes Islam’s savior.Therefore, within a biblical framework, Islam’s Isa fits the category of theAntichrist spiritdescribed in 1 John 2:18—the one who denies the Father and the Son.6. Eschatological Outcomes: A Clash of Two “Jesus” FiguresIslamic tradition asserts that their Isa will descend, kill the Christian Messiah, and enforce global Islam. However, Scripture reveals a dramatically different outcome:The true Jesus Christ returns with heavenly armies (Revelation 19:11–14)He destroys the Antichrist and his forces (2 Thessalonians 2:8)The armies opposing Him are slain in great number (Revelation 19:19–21)This sharp contrast underscores the irreconcilable nature of the two narratives. One is rooted in the biblical revelation of God; the other stands in opposition to it.7. The Deception Embedded in Islamic TheologyIslamic doctrine establishes an eschatological system that redefines evil as good and good as evil. It prepares its followers to:Reject the real JesusEmbrace a false ChristOppose God’s redemptive planMisinterpret the return of Christ as the arrival of the “Dajjal”This, according to Scripture, is the very essence of end-time deception (2 Corinthians 11:13–15).8. ConclusionThe Jesus of the Bible and the Isa of Islam are not the same. One is the true Son of God, the Savior of the world, and the returning King. The other is a figure constructed within a theological system that denies the essential truths of the Gospel.For Christians, the warning is clear:faithfulness requires discernment.The rise of a false Christ is not a distant theory but a present theological reality embedded within Islamic doctrine.The true Jesus Christ—crucified, resurrected, and glorified—will return to judge the world and to expose every counterfeit. Until then, believers must hold fast to the biblical revelation and refuse to be deceived.",

    "full_content": "**A Comparative Theological Analysis of Jesus and Muhammad:A Study in Ethical Response, Devotional Identity, and Religious Behavioral Outcomes**By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis paper examines the contrasting ethical paradigms, behavioral expectations, and devotional identities formed around Jesus Christ in Christianity and Muhammad in Islam. By analyzing scriptural texts, historical interpretations, and sociological patterns, this study demonstrates how the teachings of Jesus promote nonviolence, forgiveness, and restraint, whereas the Qur’anic commands and Hadith traditions concerning Muhammad cultivate defensive aggression, honor-based retaliation, and extreme emotional loyalty. The analysis reveals that these divergent foundations produce markedly different religious expressions, especially regarding reactions to insult, criticism, and perceived dishonor.1. IntroductionReligious figures shape not only the doctrines of their faiths but also the ethical behaviors and social identities of their followers. Jesus Christ and Muhammad stand at the center of two of the world’s largest religions, yet the responses inspired by their teachings to insult, mockery, and opposition are fundamentally different. This paper contrasts these responses by analyzing New Testament teachings, Qur’anic injunctions, and major Hadith traditions, highlighting their implications for contemporary religious behavior.2. Jesus Christ: A Model of Sacrificial Love and NonviolenceIn the New Testament, Jesus presents Himself as the shepherd who lays down His life willingly:“I lay down My life for the sheep”(John 10:17–18 NKJV). His ethic extends beyond personal sacrifice to include radical forgiveness and love for adversaries. Jesus instructs His followers to bless those who curse them, love their enemies, and pray for their persecutors (Matthew 5:44; Luke 6:27–28). He never commands retaliation—verbal, physical, or otherwise—even when facing rejection, mockery, or violence.Christians throughout history have produced art, literature, and modern media caricaturing, satirizing, or even insulting Jesus. Yet mainstream Christian response, shaped by Jesus’ teachings, remains largely nonviolent. Christian theology locates vengeance solely in the hands of God:“Vengeance is Mine, I will repay, says the Lord”(Romans 12:19). This theological foundation fosters patience, restraint, and mercy in the face of provocation.3. Muhammad: Honor Defense, Scriptural Commands, and Emotional ConditioningIslamic scripture presents a markedly different paradigm concerning Muhammad’s honor. Various Qur’anic verses call Muslims to fight those who insult, oppose, or reject Muhammad and the Islamic message (Qur’an 9:5; 9:13; 33:57). Sūrah 9, in particular, repeatedly commands Muslims to “fight,” “strive,” and “expend life and wealth” for Allah’s cause (9:41), interpreted by major classical scholars as including the defense of Muhammad’s personal dignity and the Islamic community.Hadith literature reinforces this militant posture. Collections such as Sahih Bukhari (Hadith 4064) and Sahih Muslim (Hadith 1904) praise companions who demonstrate extreme loyalty by entering battle or risking their lives to protect Muhammad. Within this tradition, insult to Muhammad—whether through criticism, satire, or artistic depiction—is treated as a profound offense warranting severe retribution, including death.Sociologically, this framework fosters a deep, emotionally charged attachment to Muhammad. In many Muslim societies, love for Muhammad is not cultivated through rational engagement with his teachings but through early indoctrination, communal identity, and honor culture. The result is a form of tribal or symbolic loyalty wherein the figure of Muhammad becomes an untouchable emblem of group identity. Insulting him is thus perceived not merely as religious blasphemy but as a direct assault on one’s personal and collective self.4. Devotional Identity: Love Versus ObsessionThe contrasting responses to insult illustrate the deeper theological divide. The Christian identity is anchored in Jesus’ ethic of love, mercy, and forgiveness. Mockery of Jesus—though personally offensive to believers—does not provoke violence, because Christian discipleship emphasizes spiritual maturity, emotional self-control, and trust in divine justice.Conversely, many Muslims respond to insult with fury, protest, or violence, not only because of doctrinal commands but because Muhammad functions as a symbol of collective pride. This is not devotion rooted in personal transformation; rather, it resembles the intense loyalty found in tribal systems, authoritarian movements, or fandom cultures. The readiness to kill or die for Muhammad often lacks theological reflection and instead emerges from cultural conditioning and communal pressure.5. ConclusionJesus and Muhammad inspire their followers in profoundly different ways. Jesus models sacrificial love and nonviolence, creating religious communities that respond to provocation with grace and forgiveness. Muhammad, by contrast, is surrounded by scriptural mandates for honor defense and retaliatory action, shaping communities that often conflate religious devotion with aggression, tribal loyalty, and emotional extremism.This comparative analysis underscores that what Jesus inspires is genuine spiritual transformation, moral strength, and peace. What Muhammad inspires, in many sociocultural contexts, is not faith but an emotionally heightened form of identity protection—one that can manifest in hostility and violence. Ultimately, love, forgiveness, and mercy—as taught by Jesus—prove far more powerful than fear-driven loyalty or coercive religious obligation.",

    "full_content": "Jesus and Muhammad: A Comparative Theological and Ethical AnalysisBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis article presents a comparative analysis of Jesus Christ and Muhammad, focusing on their teachings, ethical frameworks, and the nature of devotion they inspired in their followers. Using biblical texts, Qur’anic references, and historical traditions, the study argues that the two figures represent fundamentally different models of leadership, sacrifice, and moral instruction. The contrast between voluntary self-sacrifice and enforced loyalty reveals significant theological and sociological implications for Christian and Islamic religious ethics.1. IntroductionThroughout religious history, Jesus of Nazareth and Muhammad of Arabia have stood as central figures shaping the beliefs and behaviors of billions. Yet their legacies diverge sharply in the moral frameworks they established and the responses they elicited from their respective communities. Understanding these contrasts is essential in evaluating the ethical foundations of Christianity and Islam.2. Jesus Christ: Voluntary Sacrifice and Non-Violent Teaching2.1 Jesus’ Self-Giving MissionJesus’ declaration—“I lay down My life for the sheep”(John 10:17–18, NKJV)—establishes a central Christian belief: His life was not taken by force but freely given. This voluntary self-sacrifice forms the cornerstone of Christian soteriology.2.2 Teaching on Non-Violence and MercyJesus consistently taught forgiveness, compassion, and restraint. His instructions include:“Love your enemies”(Matthew 5:44),“Do good to those who hate you”(Luke 6:27–28),“Do not avenge yourselves… for vengeance is Mine, says the Lord”(Romans 12:19).These teachings shaped a faith community characterized by patience and non-retaliation, even in the face of mockery or persecution. Historically, Jesus has been caricatured in art, literature, and modern media, yet Christian responses largely reflect His emphasis on forgiveness rather than violence.3. Muhammad: Enforced Loyalty and the Culture of Defensive Aggression3.1 Qur’anic Commands Related to Defense of MuhammadThe Qur’an issues instructions concerning opposition or insult toward Muhammad, including:Commands to fight idolaters (Qur’an 9:5),Promises of punishment for those who “annoy” or oppose the Prophet (Qur’an 33:57),Calls to struggle with life and wealth “in Allah’s cause” (Qur’an 9:41).Islamic exegetes often interpret these verses within the context of defending the Prophet’s honor and ensuring communal cohesion around his authority.3.2 Hadith Literature and Devotion Through WarfareTraditions recorded inSahih Bukhari(4064) andSahih Muslim(1904) praise followers who risked or gave their lives in battle to defend Muhammad and the early Muslim community. This has contributed historically to a culture where devotion is associated with militant defense and emotional loyalty.3.3 Sociological Dimension: Identity and Emotional ConditioningIn many Muslim societies, loyalty to Muhammad is intertwined with cultural identity, social conditioning, and communal honor codes. This fusion can create an environment where criticism—whether in art, literature, or satire—may provoke extreme reactions. The phenomenon resembles forms of tribal loyalty or collective emotional programming more than theological reflection.4. Comparative Analysis: Light and Darkness as Ethical Metaphors4.1 The Ethics of Response to InsultJesus: Encourages forgiveness, prayer, and non-retaliation.Muhammad: Islamic tradition often demands active defense, including violent action in certain contexts.4.2 Nature of DevotionThe devotion inspired by Jesus is grounded in love, grace, and voluntary trust.The devotion surrounding Muhammad often manifests as obligatory loyalty reinforced by legal, cultural, and emotional pressures.4.3 Leadership ParadigmsJesus models sacrificial leadership—laying down His life for others.Muhammad’s leadership often involves followers laying down their lives for him or for the expansion and protection of the Islamic community.5. Theological and Ethical ImplicationsThe divergent responses of Christians and Muslims to criticism of their respective leaders highlight deeper doctrinal differences:Christian ethicsemphasize inner transformation, mercy, and imitation of Christ’s humility.Islamic ethics, particularly within classical jurisprudence, incorporate elements of honor defense, communal preservation, and retributive justice.These distinctions shape cultural patterns, legal frameworks, and social expectations across both religious communities.6. ConclusionJesus Christ and Muhammad represent two contrasting moral and theological universes. Jesus embodies self-sacrifice, forgiveness, and unconditional love—inviting His followers to respond to insult with prayer and grace. Muhammad, by contrast, is closely associated with a tradition of honor-based loyalty, defensive aggression, and strict community enforcement.The contrast is not merely historical but ethical, shaping how billions respond to mockery, disagreement, and religious criticism. Love, forgiveness, and voluntary devotion—as modeled by Jesus—remain ethically superior to coercive loyalty and violence. In the end, the light of Christ’s mercy stands in stark opposition to the darkness of retaliation and enforced allegiance.",

    "full_content": "A Comparative Theological and Narrative Analysis of Moses, Jesus, and MuhammadBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis study provides a comprehensive comparative analysis of the narrative, ethical, and theological portrayals of Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad within their respective religious traditions. Whereas the biblical accounts of Moses and Jesus exhibit profound emotional depth, moral complexity, and spiritual coherence, the Islamic portrayal of Muhammad relies heavily on doctrinal proclamation and later historical embellishments. Despite widespread Islamic claims that Muhammad is “the greatest man in history,” such statements often lack narrative substantiation, ethical resonance, or historical evidence comparable to the biblical prophetic tradition. This paper critically evaluates these claims, explores the literary qualities of biblical texts versus Islamic sources, and challenges the retroactive Islamic reclassification of biblical prophets as “Muslims,” a term historically nonexistent prior to the 7th century. The study concludes that the biblical prophetic tradition contains an intrinsic beauty and moral force absent in the Islamic narrative of Muhammad.1. IntroductionProphetic figures shape the core narratives of the Abrahamic faiths. Their lives, teachings, and moral influence define the theological foundations of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. While Judaism and Christianity draw from deeply rooted and historically continuous scriptural traditions, Islam retroactively integrates earlier prophets into its own theological framework.In modern Islamic discourse, Muhammad is frequently promoted as “the greatest man in history,” a claim often grounded not in historical-critical scholarship but in devotional rhetoric, selective online rankings, or repeated slogans. This contrasts sharply with the self-authenticating power of the biblical narratives of Moses and Jesus, which require no promotional reinforcement to convey their emotional, moral, and spiritual depth.This paper provides an academic examination of the literary, theological, and historical dimensions of these three figures to assess the validity of comparative greatness claims and the legitimacy of Islamic retrospective classification.2. Literature Review2.1. Moses in Biblical ScholarshipScholarly studies on Moses emphasize the complexity of his identity: a Hebrew child raised in an Egyptian court, a fugitive, a shepherd, and finally a reluctant prophet chosen by YHWH. Widely recognized works in biblical studies highlight Moses’ humanity, moral struggles, and leadership under divine commission. His story permeates Jewish and Christian theology, serving as a foundational liberation narrative.2.2. Jesus in Theological and Historical StudiesHistorical Jesus scholarship—spanning conservative, moderate, and critical perspectives—agrees that Jesus’ message centered on compassion, forgiveness, and the kingdom of God. His crucifixion is universally recognized as a historical event, and Christian theology views His sacrificial death as the pinnacle of divine love. The Sermon on the Mount and His prayer of forgiveness from the cross are widely acknowledged as unmatched ethical teachings.2.3. Muhammad in Islamic Sources and Western ResearchIslamic scholarship on Muhammad relies primarily on theSīra(biographies) andHadithliterature, compiled one to two centuries after his death. Many Western scholars note that these sources blend history with theological idealization. The Qur’an itself provides minimal narrative about Muhammad, emphasizing commands and legislation over personal biography. Works in critical Islamic studies often highlight the contrast between Muhammad’s militarized prophetic model and the pacifistic moral vision of Jesus.2.4. Claims of Prophetic Continuity in IslamIslam claims that all previous prophets were “Muslims,” yet this assertion lacks corroborating evidence from Jewish, Christian, Greek, Roman, or Near Eastern historical records. The terminology and theological constructs ofIslamandMuslimare absent from all pre-Islamic sources, appearing only with the rise of Muhammad in the 7th century.3. MethodologyThis research employs:Comparative literary analysisof scriptural texts (Torah, New Testament, Qur’an, Hadith).Historical-critical analysisof the development of prophetic narratives.Narrative criticismto assess emotional depth, moral force, and human resonance.Theological evaluationof each figure’s message and method of leadership.The study does not seek to undermine individuals but to evaluate textual and historical claims within an academic framework.4. Analysis4.1. Moses: A Narrative Rooted in Vulnerability and Divine CallingThe story of Moses resonates because of its transparency. The Torah presents Moses as:fearful (Exod. 3:11; 4:10)unwilling (Exod. 4:13)exiled and humbled (Exod. 2:15)dependent entirely on God’s guidanceHis leadership arises not from conquest but from obedience. The liberation of Israel, the challenge to Pharaoh, and the journey toward the Promised Land are built upon a narrative of divine-human partnership rather than force.4.2. Jesus: The Apex of Moral and Emotional ResonanceJesus’ narrative surpasses all in ethical profundity:He heals out of compassion, not power projection.He teaches radical love: “Love your enemies” (Matt. 5:44).His crucifixion reveals ultimate forgiveness: “Father, forgive them” (Luke 23:34).His Kingdom message transforms individuals and societies through internal renewal rather than political conquest.The emotional depth of Jesus’ life and death remains unmatched in ancient literature.4.3. Muhammad: A Prophet Defined by Command and ConquestIslamic narratives reveal a markedly different prophetic model:Muhammad participates in more than twenty military campaigns.Apostasy from his religion is punishable by death in traditional Islamic law.The expansion of Islam historically occurred through political dominance and, in many cases, coercion.Islamic devotional literature exalts Muhammad with titles and slogans (“the greatest man”), yet provides few narratives of moral vulnerability or self-sacrificial love. Instead, Muhammad’s greatness is treated as a doctrinal requirement rather than an organically compelling story.4.4. The Absence of Emotional or Narrative Depth in Islamic BiographyUnlike Moses and Jesus, whose narratives invite empathy and transformation, theSīraandHadithpresent Muhammad primarily as:a lawgivera military commandera political leaderThis functional portrayal lacks the deeply human emotional resonance found in biblical stories. The consequence is that Muslims must assert Muhammad’s greatness externally rather than demonstrating it through intrinsic narrative beauty.5. Discussion5.1. The Need for Repetition: Why Muhammad Must Be Declared GreatIslamic tradition elevates Muhammad through formulaic recitations because his narrative lacks the aesthetic and moral force of biblical prophetic traditions. The repetition compensates for the absence of narrative persuasion.5.2. The Appropriation of Biblical Figures into Islamic TheologyIslam often appropriates Moses, Jesus, David, Solomon, and others as “Muslims,” but this claim collapses under historical scrutiny:The wordsIslamandMuslimappear nowhere in pre-Islamic texts.Judaism and Christianity never used Islamic terminology.The Qur’an retrospectively reinterprets earlier prophets to validate Muhammad.This retroactive theological revision lacks historical foundations and appears motivated by the need to legitimize Muhammad's prophethood.5.3. Contrasting Leadership ModelsFigureLeadership ModelMethodMosesReluctant prophetDivine calling, liberationJesusServant-SaviorLove, sacrifice, transformationMuhammadCommander-prophetPolitical power, conquestThe distinctions are stark and historically recognized.6. ConclusionThe narratives of Moses and Jesus possess intrinsic spiritual, emotional, and moral power requiring no external validation. Moses’ vulnerability and Jesus’ sacrificial love stand as literary and theological masterpieces.In contrast, Muhammad’s portrayal in Islamic literature is rooted in obedience, command, and conquest rather than vulnerability, compassion, or transformative love. Claims declaring Muhammad “the greatest man” reflect doctrinal insistence rather than narrative evidence.Furthermore, Islamic attempts to reclassify all biblical prophets as “Muslims” are historically unjustifiable and linguistically anachronistic. The termsIslamandMuslimdid not exist prior to Muhammad.Ultimately, the greatness of Moses and Jesus is self-evident through their stories. The greatness of Muhammad must be proclaimed repeatedly because it cannot be demonstrated through narrative depth, emotional resonance, or moral beauty. When greatness is asserted but not evidenced, it ceases to be faith and becomes a form of false witness — something Scripture identifies as morally unacceptable.",

Rather, he was afabricated prophet, meaning his prophethood was invented like a musical performance. When we examine Muhammad’s history, we learn the following:When Muhammad reached the age of 38, due to the hardships of life, he left his home and relocated to the caves ofJabal Hira, located near the city of Mecca. At the age of 40, one day he was approached by a being that Muslims today call the Angel Gabriel.The so-called “revelation” (wahyi) that came to Muhammad made him hear the sound of bells; his face turned red, and sweat poured from his body. InSahih al-Bukhari, Hadith No. 2, Vol. 1; Al-Lu’lu, Book 3, p. 874, Hadith No. 1505, we read the following:Aisha (r.a), the Mother of the Believers, narrated thatAl-Harith ibn Hisham (r.a)asked the Messenger of Allah:“O Messenger of Allah, how does revelation come to you?”The Prophet replied:“Sometimes it comes like the ringing of a bell, and that is the hardest on me. When the sound stops, I have received the revelation.And sometimes the angel comes in the form of a man and speaks to me, and I understand what he says.”Aisha added:“I saw revelation coming to him on a very cold day, and once it departed from him, his forehead would be dripping with sweat.”The Qur’an confirms this inSura 53:2–6 (An-Najm – The Star):Your companion (Muhammad) has neither strayed nor erred.Nor does he speak from his own desire.It is nothing but revelation revealed to him.Taught to him by one mighty in power—Gabriel—one endowed with strength, who stood firm.”Let us continue with the analysis.Muhammad Was Manipulated by Satan While in the CaveIn the book“Wakeze Mtume Wakubwa na Wanawe”written bySheikh Abdullah Saleh Al-Farsy, p. 12, we read:“The Prophet became frightened and returned to his wife. He told her what had happened, and immediately a great fever overtook him. He asked to be covered with garments.He trembled severely and said:‘I fear for myself that I have been played with by Satan, that my mind has been harmed, and that I have been deceived.’”Khadija responded:“Stop saying that. It is not possible. A person with your good qualities cannot be played with by Satan…”(She then concluded):“By God, I see that you have become a prophet.”This event, which Muslims universally describe as Muhammad receiving revelation and being appointed as a prophet, clearly shows thatMuhammad himself did not know what happened to him in the cave. That is why when he reached home, he told Khadija:“It was Satan.”Not an angel, as Muslims insist today.This is our first point.Second Point: Waraqah ibn NawfalKhadija’s cousin,Waraqah ibn Nawfal, told Muhammad that the being who appeared to him was the angel Gabriel, and that Muhammad should rejoice because he is a prophet sent to the nation.Butwas Waraqah present in the caveto verify this?Third Point: Khadija’s TestimonyEven Khadija declared that Muhammad was a prophet, yetshe was not in the cave.If Muhammad said it was Satan who appeared to him, who told Khadija it was Gabriel?Think about it.Muhammad Could Not Distinguish Between Angels and SatanInTafsir Al-KashifbyMuhammad Jawad Mughniyyah, p. 74, paragraph 7, it states:“There is no way to know Satan, demons, or jinn except through revelation alone.”Qur’anSura 38:69 (Sad)says Muhammad admitted:“I had no knowledge of the exalted assembly (angels).”Muhammad even claimed thatwhen a donkey brays, it has seen Satan(Hadith inMkweli Mwaminifu, Vol. 3–4, Hadith 789).But the Bible teaches thatGod used a donkey to see and speak with an angel(Numbers 22:22–31).Muhammad saw Satan.Balaam saw the Angel of the Lord.Revelation Built on Satanic InteractionSince Muhammad’s earliest revelations involved deceptive interactions he interpreted as Satan, this casts doubt on his prophethood entirely—especially compared with biblical prophets.The Bible warns us thatSatan disguises himself as an angel of light(2 Corinthians 11:13–15).Muhammad Was Bewitched (Under Magic)The Qur’an itself admits this accusation from the unbelievers:Sura 17:47“You are following only a man bewitched.”Sura113 (Al-Falaq)also deals withmagic performed against Muhammad.The commentary in Qur’an (8th edition, p. 977) explains that Muhammad was struck by sorcery that caused him illness and confusion. Numerous Islamic scholars—Bukhari, Muslim, Nasa’i, Ibn Majah, Ahmad, and others—confirmed this.This implies:If Muhammad could be controlled by sorcery, how can Muslims distinguish:which teachings came from Allah,and which came from magic?The Bible says clearly:Numbers 23:23–“There is no sorcery against Jacob, nor divination against Israel.”No biblical prophet was ever bewitched.Prophets Must Come from Israel – Qur’an AgreesBiblically, true prophets come through the lineage of Israel:Ezekiel 13:9The Qur’an also confirms thatprophethood is confined to the descendants of Isaac and Jacob:Sura 29:27Muhammad was neither an Israelite nor descended from Isaac or Jacob. He was a Qurayshi Arab.Even Muhammad warned people to stay away from his own tribe:Sahih Bukhari Vol. 1, Hadith 801Absence of MiraclesThe Qur’an testifies that Muhammad performed no miracles:Sura 29:50“They say: Why were no signs (miracles) sent down?Say: Miracles are only with Allah; I am only a warner.”But prophets in the Bible performed mighty miracles:Moses divided the Red Sea (Exodus 14:21)Paul healed the sick (Acts 19:11–12)Peter raised the dead (Acts 9:36–42)Prophetic Qualifications in Islam Contradict Biblical StandardsMuhammad claimed that the characteristics of prophets included:trimming the mustachegrowing the beardusing perfumemarriageusing a tooth-stick(FromMkweli Mwaminifu, Juzuu 3–4, Hadith 880)These are not divine attributes; they arehuman hygiene practices, not prophetic criteria.The Bible says prophets had:boldnessdivine authoritypurityspiritual insight“We Have Sent You” – Who Sent Muhammad?Qur’an4:79says:“We have sent you to the people as a messenger, and Allah is sufficient as a witness.”A witness is not the sender.Sowho sent Muhammad?Was it Khadija and Waraqah, who first declared him a prophet?Think deeply.Conclusion: The Bible and the Qur’an Contradict Muhammad’s ClaimsMuslims claim Muhammad was sent bytheirgod, the so-called “King of Kings”.But the Bible says the trueKing of KingsisJesus Christ, the Lamb of God (Revelation 17:14; 19:11–16).Thus, the two cannot be the same.",

    "full_content": "“Is there amassive hidden landin the hadith?”An academic-scholarly critique and evidence-based refutationBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba — Shimba Theological InstituteAbstract (short).A claim circulates online and in some popular discussions that asahīhhadith teaches that there is a vast landmass currently hidden from humankind (a lost continent, hidden island or entire world). This paper examines the primary texts invoked, surveys classical and contemporary tafsīr/hadīth commentary, and compares those claims to modern empirical evidence from satellite and mapping systems. The conclusion: the specificsahīhhadiths commonly cited donotdescribe — nor provide evidence for — a presently hidden, massive terrestrial continent that human technology (satellite imagery, mapping) should already have discovered. The claim is therefore a piece of misinformation when presented as a literal, modern-empirical fact.1. The claim and the primary texts people citeThe claim usually takes two shapes in popular circulation:There is a sahīh hadith that says there are whole lands hidden (now unknown) to mankind.Therefore, modern maps (Google Maps, satellites) are incomplete; a vast continent/land is currently hidden from us.What do the canonical hadith collections actually contain? One frequently cited text is the hadith about someone “usurping a span of land” and being “encircled down the seven earths” — reported in Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī and Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim. These narrations are authentic, but their wording and context donotsay “a hidden modern continent exists and is currently unknown to people.” (Sunnah)(Other narrations that speakers sometimes conflate — e.g., reports about Gog and Magog (Yaʾjūj wa-Maʾjūj) being behind a barrier, or reports about an island where the Dajjāl is held — are also circulated; these are of mixed chains and require careful study and distinct treatment.) (Ghayb)2. How classical and contemporary scholars read these textsScholars have offered several interpretive approaches to formulations such as “seven earths” or references to other lands:Literal-multilayer / multiple-worlds reading.Some classical mufassirūn and ḥadīth commentators accept that “seven earths” could mean distinct realms/lands created by God (analogous to seven heavens), whose exact nature is part of the unseen (ghayb). (SeekersGuidance)Metaphorical / moral reading.Other scholars stress the moral, juridical or eschatological point of the narration (e.g., the severity of usurping land) rather than a geographical claim about an unknown continent; thus the language may be symbolic or concerned with ultimate punishment rather than with cartography. (SeekersGuidance)Caution about over-literalization.Contemporary scholars frequently caution Muslims not to force ahādīth about the unseen into modern scientific categories; where the texts speak of the unseen, classical scholars often say: believe what is reported and do not insist on empirical analogues beyond what the text permits. (Islam-QA)Bottom line from the fiqh/tafsīr/hadīth side:the canonical narrations cited by claimants do not straightforwardly assert the existence of a presently hidden, cartographically-large landmass on Earth that human observation should already have detected. Rather, they belong to cosmological or eschatological discourse and admit multiple legitimate interpretive options. (SeekersGuidance)3. Empirical test: what would amassive hidden landmean for satellite and mapping evidence?If there were alargelandmass on Earth (on the order of a continent or large island) that humans had not observed or mapped:It would block or alter satellite optical imagery (visible bands) and radar returns at many wavelengths, and it would appear in multiple independent datasets collected by different agencies and commercial providers.Modern Earth-observation systems provide near-global coverage at multiple resolutions and wavelengths (NASA’s MODIS, Landsat series, ESA Sentinel, plus commercial high-resolution providers). Google Earth/Google Maps aggregate imagery from many such sources and also incorporate aerial, street-level, and photogrammetric data. These datasets overlap and are independently collected. (Worldview)Google itself reports very high coverage of habitable areas (Google Earth/Maps cover the vast majority of inhabited places and high-resolution datasets span almost the entire land surface available for imaging). Independent scientific programs (Landsat, Sentinel, MODIS) provide continuous global monitoring. The practical implication: a continent-scale feature cannot remain unseen across these independent systems for long. (Google)Therefore:from an empirical/remote-sensing perspective, the notion of a modernmassivelandmass currently hidden from humanity is extremely implausible.4. Why the “hidden land” myth spreads (and how to correct it)Several dynamics produce and sustain the myth:Conflation of genres.Eschatological, cosmological, and metaphorical hadith language gets conflated with modern, empirical geography. An image that was theological/eschatological becomes read as a geographic claim. Scholarly nuance is lost in popular transmission. (SeekersGuidance)Ambiguous expressions (“seven earths”, “barrier”, “hidden island”).Classical Arabic terms (and Qurʾānic metaphors) admit multiple readings; readers who prefer sensational readings select the literal/physical interpretation and ignore alternate readings.Trust deficit and conspiratorial thinking.In an era of conspiracy narratives, a claim that “authorities are hiding a continent” is emotionally attractive and shares features with other modern conspiracies (secret islands, hidden bases, suppressed maps).How to correct it (practical steps):Encourage responsible citation: always publish the exact hadith text, the isnād, and classical explanations when making extraordinary claims. (Sunnah)Refer readers to authoritative tafsīr and hadith collections (e.g., Tafsīr al-Qurʾān by al-Tabari/Ibn Kathīr where relevant, and standard hadith collections with isnād/grades) and point out diversity of scholarly views. (SeekersGuidance)For empirical claims invoke open satellite datasets (NASA Earthdata, Landsat, Sentinel) and Google Earth/Maps — these are public, independently collected, and routinely updated; invite claimants to pick coordinates and check multiple imagery sources. (NASA Earthdata)5. Qualified limits and honest caveatsUnderground or ephemeral features.The above does not deny the existence of underground caverns, subterranean structures, or places with sparse satellite coverage in very high resolution (e.g., deep caves, dense canopy) — those are not “massive continents” and would not change the overall global land map.Areas of restricted imaging.Certain sensitive sites (military bases, some governmental restrictions) may limit public high-resolution imagery in specific locations, but this is not the same as an entire hidden continent. Google and scientific satellites still provide multisource datasets that would reveal large-scale land presence. (Google for Developers)6. ConclusionTextually:The sahīh hadiths cited in social media (e.g., the “seven earths” wording) are authentic in wording, but their most reasonable classical readings donotrequire us to accept a claim that a large terrestrial continent is currently hidden from humanity. They speak in cosmological/eschatological register and admit multiple scholarly interpretations. (Sunnah)Empirically:Modern satellite imagery and mapping systems (NASA, Landsat, Sentinel, Google Earth/Maps and many commercial providers) produce overlapping, independent, near-global coverage. The persistence of an undiscovered continent is inconsistent with the empirical evidence. (Landsat Science)Therefore:Presenting asahīh hadithas proof that there is a currently hidden massive land on Earth is a misreading of the texts combined with a misapplication of modern empirical claims. Such a claim should be treated as misinformation.Selected resources & further reading(These are sources to check primary texts, tafsīr, and empirical datasets.)Primary hadith texts & commentarySahih al-Bukhari / Sahih Muslim entries on “one who usurps a span of land … seven earths.” (various online editions and searchable collections).

These narrations are not a basis for claiming a presently hidden continent. Independent satellite and mapping datasets (NASA, Landsat, Google Earth etc.) provide near-global coverage; a continent-scale terrestrial landmass invisible to them is empirically implausible. Prudence requires careful textual reading combined with open empirical verification.”",

    "full_content": "Title: The Crisis of Authenticity in Islam: A Theological and Sociopolitical ReflectionBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis paper examines the pressing question of religious authenticity within Islam, particularly in light of extremist movements such as Hamas and ISIS. Despite their rigorous adherence to Islamic rituals—daily prayers, fasting, almsgiving, and Quranic memorization—these groups have engaged in violent acts that contradict the moral and humanitarian values they claim to uphold. This analysis seeks to understand how such contradictions can exist within a religious framework that lacks a formal mechanism of excommunication or theological correction.IntroductionThe global image of Islam has been deeply affected by the actions of extremist organizations that profess to represent true Islamic piety. Movements likeHamasandISIShave demonstrated outward devotion—meticulous in prayer, fasting, and recitation of the Qur’an—yet they have simultaneously propagated terror, killed civilians, and committed acts of violence against both Muslims and non-Muslims. This paradox presents a profound theological and moral dilemma:who defines what it means to be a “true Muslim”?Unlike other religious traditions, Islam possessesno centralized authorityor formal system of excommunication. Consequently, anyone may self-identify as Muslim regardless of their interpretation or behavior. This theological vacuum allows extremists to weaponize religious language and rituals while justifying acts of brutality in the name of faith.The Deceptive Nature of Outward PietyIslamic extremism exposes the limitations of external religiosity as a marker of spiritual authenticity. Outward piety—strict observance of prayer, fasting, and almsgiving—can easily mask inner corruption. In groups such as ISIS and Hamas, ritual precision has become aperformance of legitimacy, while their violent conduct stands in direct opposition to Qur’anic injunctions against murder and injustice (Qur’an 5:32).To the uninformed observer, such ritual-perfect adherents appear more devout than moderate or reformist Muslims, making it difficult to distinguishtrue faith from fanaticism. This phenomenon mirrors Jesus’ criticism of the Pharisees in the Gospels, who were outwardly righteous but inwardly corrupt (Matthew 23:27).The Silence of Religious LeadershipEqually troubling is thesilence of many Islamic clerics and scholars. Few are willing to challenge extremist ideologies publicly. Some, like the controversial preacherZakir Naik, have even offered implicit or explicit justifications for militant interpretations of jihad. This reluctance to engage in open theological debate has allowed extremist ideologies to flourish unchecked within the Muslim world.In contrast, other religious traditions—Christianity, for instance—have historically confronted heresy and doctrinal corruption through public councils, creeds, and formal condemnations. The absence of similar institutional accountability in Islam leaves a dangerous vacuum where extremist interpretations can claim divine legitimacy.Theological ImplicationsIf groups such as Hamas and ISIS are not “real Muslims,” then one must ask:why has there been no unified, authoritative condemnation from the global Muslim community?Conversely, if these groups are indeed acting consistently within certain interpretations of Islamic texts, then this raises serious theological concerns about the divine authenticity of those interpretations themselves.This dilemma exposes Islam’s internal crisis—a religion deeply fragmented by its lack of central authority and interpretive unity. The coexistence of peace-loving Muslims and militant jihadists under the same religious banner demonstrates that Islam, as practiced today, operates more as ahumanly constructed systemthan a divinely unified faith.ConclusionThe challenge before Islamic theologians and leaders is immense. To reclaim moral credibility, Islam must develop a mechanism fortheological accountability—a means to publicly denounce and excommunicate those who distort its teachings for political violence. Until that happens, extremists will continue to masquerade as devout believers, and the world will remain uncertain whether their faith inspires peace or perpetuates bloodshed.The question remains: if Islam is divine, why does it continually produce movements that embody its most violent interpretations? Unless answered through open theological reform and moral courage, the silence of Islamic leadership will serve as its own indictment.ReferencesThe Holy Qur’an, Surah Al-Ma’idah 5:32 –“Whoever kills a soul unless for a soul or for corruption [done] in the land—it is as if he had slain mankind entirely.”The Holy Bible, Matthew 23:27 –“Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres...”Esposito, John L.

    "full_content": "Islam as a Culture of ArabificationBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIslam, while widely recognized as a global religion, carries with it profound cultural implications that extend beyond mere faith. Historically, the spread of Islam has been closely intertwined with the propagation of Arab culture, resulting in a process that can be understood as a form of Arabification. This cultural phenomenon is evident in several distinct dimensions of Islamic practice and identity.Firstly, the linguistic element is prominent. Arabic is not only the liturgical language of Islam but is also positioned as the central medium for religious expression and understanding. Non-Arab converts are often required to learn Arabic to engage fully with the Quran, perform prayers (Salat), and recite religious texts correctly. The insistence on Arabic as the language of worship and knowledge transmission represents a deliberate cultural imposition, ensuring that adherents adopt not only the religion but also the associated linguistic framework.Secondly, dietary and lifestyle practices underscore Arabification. Islamic dietary laws, derived from Arabic jurisprudence, dictate the consumption of specific foods (halal) and the avoidance of others (haram), which are closely aligned with historical Arab eating customs. Similarly, dress codes—such as the hijab, thobe, and other traditional garments—reflect Arab sartorial norms. These prescriptions shape the daily life of Muslims, fostering cultural assimilation into an Arabized lifestyle.Thirdly, Islamic rituals are spatially Arab-centric. The act of worship requires facing Mecca, the Arabian city of profound religious significance, during prayer. Pilgrimage (Hajj) also centralizes Mecca and Medina as the spiritual and physical heart of Islam, reinforcing the primacy of Arab geography in the religious imagination. Even the structure of mosques and the aesthetic of Islamic art often mirrors Arab architectural traditions, further embedding Arab culture into the global Muslim experience.Finally, these aspects collectively point to Islam not merely as a religion but as a vehicle for Arab cultural propagation. While Islam’s theological claims are universal, its practices systematically require adherence to Arab linguistic, dietary, sartorial, and spatial norms. The result is a dual imposition: acceptance of faith coupled with absorption into an Arab cultural identity. This cultural dimension has profound implications for non-Arab societies, where conversion to Islam often entails a degree of Arabization in daily life, thought, and social behavior.In conclusion, the Arabification embedded within Islamic practice highlights the inseparable relationship between faith and culture in Islam. Understanding Islam in this light allows scholars and practitioners to critically examine the extent to which religious adherence involves cultural assimilation, particularly into Arab norms, and to explore the broader social, linguistic, and cultural ramifications of this process.References:Lapidus, I.

IntroductionThe relationship between Islam and the Judeo-Christian world has long been complex and often contentious. Despite sharing common Abrahamic roots, the Quran and Hadith literature contain numerous passages that reflect Muhammad’s growing animosity toward Jews and Christians. One of the most striking declarations of this animosity appears inSahih Muslim 1767a, where Muhammad is quoted as saying:“I will expel the Jews and Christians from the Arabian Peninsula and will not leave any but Muslim.”(Sahih Muslim 1767a, narrated by ʿUmar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb)This statement, recorded in one of Islam’s most authoritative hadith collections, is not merely a historical comment but a theological directive that influenced centuries of Islamic policy toward non-Muslims.2. Historical Context of the HadithThe hadith in question originates from a period when Muhammad had consolidated political and military power in Medina. His early interactions with Jewish tribes such as Banu Qaynuqa, Banu Nadir, and Banu Qurayza were marked by treaties of coexistence that later ended in violent conflicts and expulsions. These tribes were accused of disloyalty, but the deeper cause was theological—Jews rejected Muhammad’s prophetic claims and the Quranic distortion of Mosaic revelation.Similarly, Christians were condemned in the Quran for ascribing divinity to Jesus Christ (Qur’an 5:72–73). Muhammad’s repeated denunciations of both Jews and Christians as “infidels” (kuffar) and “enemies of Allah” (Qur’an 9:30) established an enduring dichotomy between Muslims and non-Muslims in Islamic thought.Thus, the statement to expel Jews and Christians was not a momentary policy decision but part of Muhammad’s larger vision to purify the Arabian Peninsula from competing theological influences and establish Islam’s exclusive hegemony.3. Theological ImplicationsTheologically, this hadith reveals Islam’s supersessionist worldview—the belief that Islam abrogates all previous revelations. By commanding the expulsion of Jews and Christians, Muhammad positioned Islam as the final and only legitimate faith in God’s plan. This teaching contradicts the biblical message of coexistence, love, and reconciliation as modeled by Jesus Christ, who taught:“Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you” (Matthew 5:44).The contrast between the inclusive gospel of Christ and the exclusionary commands of Muhammad underscores a fundamental theological divide. Whereas the New Testament envisions a kingdom embracing all nations and peoples (Matthew 28:19–20), Islam’s foundational texts promote a territorial and ideological exclusivity.4. Impact on Islamic Law and Interfaith RelationsMuhammad’s decree to remove Jews and Christians from Arabia was later codified into Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh). The second Caliph, ʿUmar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb, fulfilled this command by expelling Jewish and Christian communities from the Hejaz region. This policy became the prototype for later Islamic restrictions under thedhimmisystem, in which Jews and Christians were tolerated only under subjugation, heavy taxation (jizya), and social inferiority.Even in modern times, this theological hostility continues to shape Muslim-majority societies, where apostasy laws, blasphemy laws, and anti-conversion statutes are rooted in Muhammad’s precedent.5. Comparative Theological ReflectionFrom a Christian theological standpoint, such actions stand in direct opposition to the universal redemptive mission of Jesus Christ. The apostle Paul declared:“There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus” (Galatians 3:28).The biblical vision is thus inclusive and reconciliatory, whereas Muhammad’s command institutionalized exclusion and animosity. The hadith inSahih Muslimreflects a worldview in which divine favor is limited to one group, rejecting the broader covenantal inclusivity revealed through Christ.6. ConclusionThe hadith declaring the expulsion of Jews and Christians from the Arabian Peninsula exposes the theological hostility embedded within early Islam toward other Abrahamic faiths. Muhammad’s declaration was not only political but also spiritual—a proclamation of religious supremacy.This historical reality must be acknowledged when discussing interfaith dialogue, for authentic peace cannot emerge from denial. Only through truth, as revealed in the Gospel of Jesus Christ, can humanity transcend hatred and rediscover the divine purpose of love, forgiveness, and unity.References and BibliographySahih Muslim, Book 19, Hadith 1767a.The Qur’an 5:51, 9:29–30, 98:6.Al-Tabari,The History of al-Tabari, Volume 8: The Victory of Islam.

Islam refers to Muhammad as“al-insān al-kāmil”—the “perfect man”—and“Khatam an-Nabiyyin”—the “Seal of the Prophets.” Christianity, however, identifies Jesus Christ as the sinless Son of God, the incarnate Word, and the moral and spiritual standard for humanity (John 1:14; 1 Peter 2:22).A close theological and historical examination of their lives reveals striking contrasts. The New Testament consistently portrays Jesus as morally perfect, compassionate, and selfless, emphasizing love, humility, forgiveness, and sacrifice. His teachings uplift human dignity and encourage purity of heart and spirit (Matthew 5–7). In contrast, early Islamic sources—such asSahih al-Bukhari,Sahih Muslim, andIbn Ishaq’s Sirat Rasul Allah—record elements of Muhammad’s life that raise ethical and moral questions when compared with Christ’s example. These include accounts of multiple marriages, the marriage to Aisha at a very young age, and certain controversial practices surrounding warfare and revelation.From a Christian theological perspective, the comparison between the two figures is not merely about morality but divine nature. Jesus Christ is viewed as both fully divine and fully human, embodying the perfection of God’s moral law. Muhammad, on the other hand, is regarded in Islamic theology as a human prophet without divinity. Yet, the claim of being the “best of men” (khayr al-bashar) presents an ethical paradox when examined through a moral-theological lens.The Apostle Paul and the other apostles uniformly present Jesus as the only mediator between God and man (1 Timothy 2:5) and the ultimate revelation of God’s love (Romans 5:8). Hence, to elevate any other historical figure above Christ not only undermines biblical revelation but contradicts the Christian understanding of divine holiness and moral perfection.While Islam holds Muhammad in the highest esteem, Christian theology maintains that perfection can only be found in the divine person of Jesus Christ. The distinction between the two is not rooted in cultural bias but in the intrinsic difference between a prophet claiming human inspiration and the incarnate Word of God who embodies divine truth.ReferencesThe Holy Bible, New International Version.Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 7, Book 62.Sahih Muslim, Book of Marriage.Ibn Ishaq,Sirat Rasul Allah(The Life of Muhammad).John 1:1–14; 1 Peter 2:22; Romans 5:8; 1 Timothy 2:5.",

However, a careful exegetical study of the New Testament reveals that the doctrine of Christ’s deity was not a Pauline innovation but a consistent testimony affirmed by multiple apostolic witnesses prior to Paul’s conversion. The Gospel writers—John, Matthew, and Peter—bear independent witness to Jesus’ divine nature long before Paul’s missionary activity began.In the Gospel of John, the apostle opens with an explicit declaration:“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God”(John 1:1). Similarly, the Apostle Peter identifies Jesus as“our God and Savior, Jesus Christ”(2 Peter 1:1), while Matthew records that Jesus would be calledEmmanuel,meaning“God with us”(Matthew 1:23). These testimonies clearly demonstrate that belief in Jesus’ divinity was foundational to early Christian confession and not a later doctrinal development introduced by Paul.In contrast, the Islamic portrayal of Jesus as merely a prophet diverges sharply from the apostolic tradition rooted in firsthand experience of His divine works, resurrection, and moral perfection. The apostles lived exemplary lives characterized by sacrifice, humility, and steadfast devotion to truth, many sealing their witness with martyrdom. Their integrity and consistency lend historical and moral credibility to their message.By comparison, the prophetic model presented in early Islamic tradition reflects significant moral and theological discontinuities when evaluated against biblical standards of holiness and revelation. The historical accounts of Muhammad’s life, as preserved in Islamic sources such asSahih al-BukhariandSirat Ibn Ishaq, include episodes that raise legitimate moral and ethical questions concerning his conduct and claims to prophethood. These factors contribute to the Christian rejection of Muhammad’s message—not out of hostility, but from theological discernment and moral evaluation based on Scripture.Christianity’s foundation rests upon the revelation of Jesus Christ, affirmed by multiple witnesses and corroborated through His resurrection. Islam’s later reinterpretation of this revelation lacks apostolic continuity and diverges from the moral and theological coherence established by the early Church. Therefore, the claim that Paul “invented” the divinity of Christ is both historically and theologically unsustainable. Even without Pauline authorship, the New Testament stands as an enduring testimony to the eternal truth that Jesus Christ is God incarnate.ReferencesThe Holy Bible, New International Version (NIV): John 1:1; 2 Peter 1:1; Matthew 1:23.Bruce, F.

    "full_content": "An Academic Analysis of the Rapid Growth of Islam: A Theological PerspectiveBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteThe rapid expansion of Islam in the modern world has often been interpreted as evidence of divine approval or spiritual authenticity. However, from a theological and ethical standpoint, growth in numbers does not necessarily equate to spiritual truth or holiness. The New Testament consistently emphasizes transformation through repentance, regeneration, and sanctification as the hallmarks of authentic faith (cf. Acts 3:19; Romans 12:2). Christianity calls individuals to moral accountability—to confess, repent, and live in righteousness through Christ’s redemptive power.In contrast, the Islamic system of salvation appears largely ritualistic, emphasizing external observances rather than inward transformation. The Five Pillars of Islam—profession of faith, daily prayers, fasting during Ramadan, almsgiving, and pilgrimage to Mecca—constitute a framework that, while structured, lacks the soteriological depth found in the Christian doctrine of grace and repentance (Ephesians 2:8–9). The notion that one’s sins can be absolved merely through ritual performance, pilgrimage, or adherence to prescribed acts, presents a moral challenge from a biblical perspective. It suggests an external form of righteousness without the inner renewal of the heart that Scripture demands (Matthew 15:8; Romans 10:10).Furthermore, certain Islamic allowances—such as polygamy (Qur’an 4:3), concubinage, and historically sanctioned slavery—reflect sociocultural accommodations rather than divine moral perfection. These elements underscore a religion that, in many instances, caters to human appetites rather than restrains them through divine holiness. The Qur’anic depiction of paradise as a place of sensual reward (Qur’an 56:22–24) further supports the argument that Islam’s eschatological vision is anthropocentric rather than theocentric.From a Christian theological lens, this system aligns with the Pauline warning against deceptive spiritual systems that mimic holiness while denying the power of true godliness: “And for this reason God will send them strong delusion, that they should believe the lie” (2 Thessalonians 2:11–12, NKJV). This “delusion” may well describe a religious framework that replaces divine transformation with ritual compliance, grace with law, and holiness with human gratification.The growth of Islam, therefore, should be understood not as an indication of divine truth but as a socioreligious phenomenon shaped by ease of observance, ritualistic assurance, and permissive moral codes. True religion, according to Scripture, is not measured by numbers but by righteousness, repentance, and reconciliation with the living God through Jesus Christ—the only name under heaven by which humanity can be saved (Acts 4:12).ReferencesThe Holy Bible, New King James Version.The Qur’an, trans.

    "full_content": "Why direct archaeological references to the nameAllahare scarceBy Dr Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractIslamic tradition holds that God sent a very large number of prophets to every people (a commonly cited figure in popular Muslim discourse is124,000). Given such a widespread prophetic mission over millennia, one might expect widespread material traces—inscriptions, monuments or other archaeological objects—explicitly namingAllahin contexts that clearly refer to prophets. This paper examines that expectation and explains, from linguistic, historical and archaeological perspectives, why direct archaeological references of the kind imagined are rare. It argues (1) the theological claim and its textual basis, (2) the linguistic and epigraphic history of the nameAllah, and (3) the methodological limits of archaeology when asked to confirm or refute religious-historical assertions about prophets. Citations to representative scholarly and reference sources are provided. (islamhelpline.net)1. The claim in Islamic tradition: number and distribution of prophetsA number often encountered in Muslim popular literature and some ulema-discourses is that Allah sent “124,000 prophets” (Arabic:nabiyyīn). This specific figure is traceable to post-prophetic hadith literature (longer hadith chains reported in collections such asMusnadof Aḥmad and other reports), but it is not presented in the Qurʾān itself and is treated with caution by many scholars of hadith; authoritative modern statements note that the exact number is not known and that only God truly knows the total. Thus, while the idea of numerous prophets is an established part of the religious imagination, the precise figure is a later exegetical/historical tradition rather than Qurʾanic datum. (Islam Stack Exchange)2. The nameAllah: linguistic and epigraphic backgroundLinguistic continuity.The Arabic wordAllāhis the established Arabic term for “God” and is cognate with Semitic forms (e.g., SyriacAlāhā, HebrewEloah/Elohim). The term existed in Arabic before Islam and was used by Arabic-speaking Christians and Jews as well as by pagans to denote a high or supreme deity in some contexts. Modern reference works summarize this linguistic continuity and the word’s continued use across Abrahamic communities. (Encyclopedia Britannica)Pre-Islamic inscriptions and attestations.Epigraphic finds from late antique and pre-Islamic Arabia occasionally contain forms glossed asal-ilah/Allāh(for example, the so-called Zabad inscription and Christian Arabic inscriptions dated to the early sixth century). Scholarship notes that while such attestations exist, they are limited and do not constitute a widespread body of monumental inscriptions that systematically record the word in contexts that would prove or disprove particular prophetic claims. (Wikipedia)3. Why archaeological excavation rarely produces “direct references” to prophets or a theological name such asAllahExpecting archaeology to yield explicit, globally distributed inscriptions saying “Prophet X served Allah” carries several methodological problems. The following factors help explain the scarcity of such direct archaeological corroboration:3.1. Non-literacy or limited literacy in many recipient communitiesMany communities alleged to have received prophetic instruction in antiquity were oral or had limited literacy; where written records existed they were often perishable (papyrus, leather) and have not survived in most environments. Archaeology favors durable media (stone, pottery, metal), so the absence of portable writings does not mean the absence of historical persons or movements. (General literature on archaeology’s survivorship bias discusses this widely; see bibliography.) (Encyclopedia Britannica)3.2. Epigraphic genres and social practiceInscriptions in antiquity most often commemorate rulers, dedications, legal texts, land records, funerary formulas, or cultic lists. Ordinary religious teachers or local prophets frequently left no monumental record. Where religious language appears, it commonly uses local names and formulas that may not coincide with the specific theological vocabulary later used by literate, centralized religious communities. Thus, the kinds of short, local prophetic careers described in oral traditions do not necessarily produce the archaeological signatures archaeologists look for. (Encyclopedia Britannica)3.3. Linguistic variation and translation problemsThe concept expressed byAllāhcan appear under different lexemes in different languages (e.g.,El, Eloah, Alāhā), scripts (Safaitic, Sabaic, Nabataean, Syriac, Greek, Aramaic), and orthographies. An inscription may honor the supreme deity but use a cognate term or an epithet unfamiliar to modern readers; cataloguing and recognizing all these variants is a specialist task. Thus, the absence of the exact Arabic orthographic ligand “الله‎” in a region does not prove the absence of worship of the one God or of its being invoked by local teachers. (Jal LQ)3.4. Iconoclasm, reuse and destruction of religious evidenceReligious conflict, subsequent iconoclasm, building reuse and spoliation have destroyed and recycled many inscriptions and cultic monuments. Stones with inscriptions were often reused in later buildings; cult objects were repurposed or destroyed in religious reform movements, so survivals are fragmentary and not representative of past abundance. (Encyclopedia Britannica)3.5. Theological and historiographical expectations vs. archaeological methodArchaeology cannot confirm theological claims (e.g., that a given person was a prophet, or the divine origin of a message). Material remains provide context—settlement patterns, inscriptions, cult practice—but moral or spiritual claims lie outside archaeological proof. Historians therefore combine textual criticism, oral traditions and material culture to construct plausible reconstructions; archaeology is a partner, not a definitive judge, for theological claims. This methodological distinction is crucial when evaluating expectations about discovering “evidence” for prophets. (Encyclopedia Britannica)4. Synthesis and conclusionThe popular figure of124,000 prophetshas roots in later hadith corpora and theological tradition; it expresses the Qurʾānic idea that God sent guidance repeatedly, but the exact number is not a Qurʾānic datum known with historical certainty. (islamhelpline.net)The lexical itemAllāhis older than Islam as an Arabic term for God and appears in pre-Islamic and late antique contexts, but attestations are episodic rather than globally abundant. (Encyclopedia Britannica)The absence of globally distributed, explicit archaeological inscriptions that nameAllahin direct association with named prophets is not, on archaeological grounds, surprising: survival bias, oral transmission, epigraphic genre, linguistic variation, and later destruction/reuse all drastically limit what can be expected to survive in the material record. (Encyclopedia Britannica)Taken together, the religious claim (many thousands of prophets) and the archaeological record address different kinds of questions. Archaeology addresses what has survived materially and can rarely, by itself, adjudicate theological claims. Scholars must therefore treat textual tradition, epigraphy and material culture as complementary evidentiary streams, each with its own limits.Selected bibliography (representative, not exhaustive)Primary/Traditional Sources & DiscussionMusnad Aḥmad (hadith collections; long traditions sometimes cited for the “124,000” figure).

    "full_content": "Muhammad and the Question of Mercy: A Critical Examination of Qur’an 80:1By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaAbstractThe concept of mercy is central to Abrahamic religious traditions, often considered an essential characteristic of a prophet. Islamic literature frequently presents Muhammad as the epitome of mercy, yet a critical examination of the Qur’an suggests complexities that challenge this narrative. This article analyzes Qur’an 80:1, contextual historical accounts, and theological implications, highlighting tensions between the traditional portrayal of Muhammad and the textual evidence of his conduct.IntroductionMercy (rahmah) is a fundamental attribute of divinely appointed prophets, reflecting compassion, patience, and concern for humanity, particularly the marginalized. The Qur’an repeatedly emphasizes the importance of mercy in God’s character (Qur’an 21:107; 6:54) and, by extension, expects the prophetic model to embody this attribute. Mainstream Islamic discourse often extols Muhammad as \"a mercy to the worlds\" (Qur’an 21:107). However, specific verses, particularly Qur’an 80:1, prompt critical inquiry into the consistency of this portrayal.Qur’an 80:1 and Its ContextQur’an 80:1 states:“He frowned and turned away” (Sahih International translation).This verse narrates an incident involving Muhammad and Abdullah ibn Umm Maktum, a blind companion who approached the Prophet for guidance. According to exegetical sources, Muhammad initially ignored him, focusing instead on influential Quraysh leaders (Al-Qurtubi, 2006).From a theological perspective, frowning and turning away from a seeker of guidance appears inconsistent with the principles of mercy emphasized elsewhere in Islamic scripture. Scholars like Wensinck (1936) and Esposito (2002) note that while Muhammad’s overall conduct is praised, such incidents reveal a more nuanced reality, highlighting human limitations and strategic prioritization within prophetic duties.Theological AnalysisMercy in prophetic terms is not merely an affective response but an ethical obligation to provide guidance and support to all, regardless of social status (Nasr, 2003). By turning away from a marginalized individual, Muhammad’s action in Qur’an 80:1 can be interpreted as a temporary lapse, raising questions about the extent to which he universally embodied mercy.Comparatively, biblical prophets consistently demonstrate unqualified compassion, especially toward the marginalized (Isaiah 61:1–3; Luke 4:18–19). While Islamic exegesis often contextualizes the incident to justify Muhammad’s conduct, the text itself provides evidence that challenges the unqualified attribution of mercy.Historical and Social ContextThe socio-political context of Mecca in Muhammad’s era may explain, though not fully justify, his prioritization of influential Quraysh leaders over less prominent followers. According to Al-Tabari (1990), Muhammad’s strategy aimed to secure broader acceptance of Islam among the Quraysh elite, arguably delaying engagement with certain individuals. Nonetheless, the ethical implication remains that his conduct, as recorded in the Qur’an, does not consistently reflect universal mercy.Implications for Islamic TheologyQur’an 80:1 invites a reevaluation of the traditional Islamic claim that Muhammad exemplifies perfect mercy. It demonstrates that prophetic conduct, while divinely guided, may also reflect human limitations and contextual decisions. For scholars and theologians, such verses underscore the importance of nuanced interpretation and the recognition of ethical complexities in prophetic narratives.ConclusionMercy is an essential attribute for prophets in Abrahamic traditions. While Islamic tradition presents Muhammad as a figure of unparalleled compassion, Qur’an 80:1 offers a counter-narrative where he is seen frowning and turning away from a blind seeker. Scholarly examination of this verse, alongside historical and ethical analysis, highlights a need for critical engagement with the Qur’anic text. Ultimately, this verse provides an opportunity for rigorous theological reflection on the nature of mercy and prophetic responsibility.ReferencesAl-Qurtubi, M. ibn A.

    "full_content": "The Ethical Contrast Between the Teachings of Jesus Christ and the Teachings of MuhammadBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteIf humanity were to fully embrace and live according to the teachings of Jesus Christ as revealed in the Holy Scriptures, the world would indeed experience an unparalleled moral and spiritual transformation. The ethical foundation of Christ’s message rests upon love, mercy, forgiveness, and reconciliation. Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5–7) articulates an ethic of divine love that transcends human retaliation and tribal divisions. His command to “love your enemies” (Matthew 5:44) and to forgive “seventy times seven” (Matthew 18:22) outlines a theology of peace and restoration that envisions a world governed by the principles of the Kingdom of God rather than the ambitions of men.Scholars such as N.T. Wright (2012) and Craig S. Keener (2014) emphasize that Jesus’ moral vision was eschatological—He inaugurated a new way of being human rooted in divine grace and justice. His mission was not political conquest but spiritual liberation: to set humanity free from sin and to reconcile creation with the Creator (2 Corinthians 5:18–19). Thus, a world governed entirely by the teachings of Jesus would reflect divine harmony—characterized by compassion, equality, and restorative justice (Luke 4:18; John 13:34–35).In contrast, the emergence of Islam under Muhammad introduced a theological framework that blended religious devotion with political authority. Whereas Jesus declared, “My kingdom is not of this world” (John 18:36), Muhammad’s leadership in Medina institutionalized a theocratic order in which spiritual obedience and civic submission were intertwined. As historian Montgomery Watt (1953) notes, Islam from its inception functioned as both a faith and a socio-political system—a distinction that profoundly shaped its historical development.The Quranic emphasis onjihadand the legal structures ofsharia(Quran 9:29; 5:38) reveal an ethical paradigm focused on law and obedience rather than grace and inner transformation. Islamic scholars such as Ibn Kathir and al-Tabari interpreted these verses as divine mandates for enforcing religious conformity and punishing moral deviation, including corporal penalties for theft and apostasy. This legalistic orientation stands in marked contrast to Christ’s message of inward renewal and voluntary discipleship (Romans 12:2; Galatians 5:1).From a Christian theological standpoint, the contrast between Christ and Muhammad is not simply doctrinal but ontological. Jesus Christ, as the incarnate Word of God (John 1:14), embodies divine holiness and offers salvation through grace (Ephesians 2:8–9). Muhammad, by contrast, claimed to be a prophet of divine law, emphasizing submission (islam) rather than transformation. As theologian Norman Geisler (2002) observes, Christianity centers on redemption through relationship, while Islam centers on submission through regulation.Ultimately, the moral divergence between these two worldviews produces opposing visions of human society. A world governed by the principles of Jesus Christ would be one of peace, forgiveness, and mutual care. A world governed by the principles of Muhammad would be structured upon external conformity, legal control, and theocratic authority. The message of Jesus remains eternally unique: salvation and peace cannot be imposed by law but received through love. His kingdom, built upon grace and truth (John 1:17), alone offers the hope of a redeemed humanity and a restored creation.ReferencesGeisler, Norman L. & Saleeb, Abdul.Answering Islam: The Crescent in Light of the Cross.

    "full_content": "The Incompatibility of Quranic Doctrine with Genuine PeacebuildingBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteThe recurring attempts by world leaders to broker peace accords between Islamic nations and Western or Judeo-Christian states raise critical theological and ideological questions. Despite their diplomatic enthusiasm, many seem to overlook a fundamental doctrinal obstacle embedded within Islamic scripture itself. The Qur’an, in Surah al-Ma’idah (5:51), explicitly warns Muslims:“O you who believe! Do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies. They are allies of one another. And whoever among you turns to them for alliance is one of them. Indeed, Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.”This verse has profound implications for interfaith relations and international diplomacy. The prohibition is not merely historical or symbolic—it establishes a theological boundary that discourages genuine friendship, trust, and alliance with Jews and Christians. Consequently, any peace initiative that disregards this doctrinal command risks being superficial and unsustainable.Diplomatic efforts that ignore the ideological foundations of Islamic thought often devolve into ceremonial gestures—symbolic treaties without transformative impact. Western leaders, in their pursuit of political harmony, frequently treat the Middle East as a psychological or humanitarian project rather than a region governed by deep theological convictions. By neglecting to address the religious imperatives that shape Islamic geopolitics, they inadvertently engage in diplomatic theater rather than realistic statecraft.True peace requires not only political negotiation but also theological reconciliation. Until the core ideological tenets—such as the Quranic prohibition against befriending Jews and Christians—are critically examined and theologically reinterpreted within the Muslim world, the prospects for enduring peace remain fragile. The conflict, therefore, is not merely territorial or political but fundamentally doctrinal in nature.",

In the northern regions, entire villages have been burned, families displaced, and believers brutally murdered simply because of their faith in Jesus Christ.Recent reports confirm thatChristians are being driven from their homes, beaten, and even beheaded, their houses reduced to ashes. The chaos has forced tens of thousands to flee—many walking for days without food or water—seeking safety in makeshift refugee camps scattered across the country.Among these suffering yet resilient believers are members ofAfrika Wa Yesu, a Christian ministry deeply rooted in Mozambique’s rural mission fields. MissionariesRodney and Ellie Hein, who have faithfully served for over 40 years, recently visited one of these refugee camps—home to more than60,000 displaced souls. There, they found a community not consumed by despair, but filled with the joy of Christ.“They didn’t speak of their suffering; they spoke of joy over sharing the Gospel where they were,”—Ellie Hein, Missionary to MozambiqueThis testimony stands as a powerful reminder thatthe light of the Gospel shines brightest in the darkest places. While radical Islam attempts to extinguish the faith of believers through fear and violence, these Mozambican Christians areturning tragedy into testimony—using their suffering as an opportunity to proclaim the saving power of Jesus Christ.The situation remains dire. Entire regions are destabilized. Villages are ghost towns. Children are orphaned. Yet, amidst the ruins,the Church stands unbroken, holding fast to the hope that can never be silenced by terror.AtShimba Theological Institute, we call upon all Christians worldwide to:Pray ferventlyfor our brothers and sisters in Mozambique— for protection, provision, and unshakable faith.Support missionariesand ministries providing relief and spiritual encouragement on the ground.Raise awarenessin churches and communities about the escalating persecution in Africa’s forgotten corners.The blood of the martyrs has always been the seed of the Church. And once again, from the soil of Mozambique, the Gospel is sprouting through tears, faith, and forgiveness.As CBN News reports, these persecuted believers—some of whom have lost everything—are offering“powerful displays of forgiveness that point to Jesus.”Their lives testify that the love of Christ triumphs even over the sword of Islamism.“Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.”—Matthew 5:10 (NIV)Let us stand united, in prayer and action, until the light of Christ prevails over every shadow of hate.📖Full Story:Islamists Dismember Christians in Mozambique: Powerful Displays of Forgiveness Point to Jesus – CBN News✝️Issued by:Shimba Theological InstituteFor Faith.

    "full_content": "Shimba Theological Institute NewsletterU.S. Missionary Kidnapped by Suspected Jihadists in Niger: A Theological Reflection and Call to PrayerOctober 28, 2025IntroductionRecent reports indicate that an American missionary has been abducted in the West African country of Niger, in circumstances that underscore the volatile intersection of faith-mission work and rising jihadist activity. According to an article by Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN), the individual, identified as Kevin Rideout, works as a pilot for the missionary agency Serving in Mission and was reportedly kidnapped from his home in the capital, Niamey, during the night by three armed men driving a Toyota Corolla. (CBN)Rideout’s phone last pinged in a region believed to be a \"sanctuary\" for jihadist groups affiliated with Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS). (CBN) The U.S. Embassy in Niamey issued a security alert confirming heightened risks of kidnapping for Americans throughout Niger. (CBN)This situation raises urgent concerns for the global Christian mission community and calls us to theological reflection, prayerful intercession, and strategic awareness.Contextual OverviewSecurity & Mission Risk in NigerNiger has increasingly faced challenges with Islamist militant groups operating in its territory. According to security assessments, jihadist groups are reviving kidnapping operations—historically targeted at tourists and now frequently aimed at aid workers and missionaries. (CBN)The significance of the location—less than 100 yards from the presidential palace in Niamey—underlines how even the capital is not immune to security breakdowns. (CBN)Missionary ExposureAs a missionary pilot, Rideout’s role placed him in a high-risk category: operating in a region with limited infrastructure, possible state fragility, and extremist actors. The kidnapping prompts critical questions: What are the protections for missionaries in such contexts? What protocols do missionary agencies have in place? What contingency plans exist when national security collapses or shifts?Christian Persecution DimensionAccording to the 2025 World Watch List published by Open Doors USA, Niger ranks among the more dangerous countries for Christians, due to “the presence of radical Islamist groups [which] has led to frequent attacks and kidnappings, significantly limiting the freedom and safety of Christians.” (CBN)For mission-agencies, this case reflects the broader reality: Christians engaging in evangelism or service in hostile or unstable environments face both spiritual and physical risk.Theological ReflectionFrom a theological standpoint, several key themes emerge:1. The Doctrine of Suffering and Christian PresenceThe missionary vocation involves embracing a life of risk—and even potential martyrdom—in service of the Gospel (cf. Matthew 10 : 24-25; 2 Timothy 3 : 12). The abduction of Kevin Rideout reminds us that mission is not always safe, yet the presence of the Christian in hostile contexts bears witness to the incarnational reality of Christ (John 1 : 14) who enters into the risk of the world.2. Intercession & Spiritual WarfareThe call from the evangelical community—“pray for his protection and that he will be released unharmed” (CBN)—reflects the biblical mandate for the church to intercede (Ephesians 6 : 18; 1 Timothy 2 : 1). In contexts of kidnapping and violence, prayer is not sentimental but strategic: aligning with the battle that is “not against flesh and blood” (Ephesians 6 : 12).3. The Role of the Missionary Amid DarknessIn a world where spiritual darkness is present (Ephesians 6 : 12; Colossians 1 : 13), missionaries venture into “dark places” (as one missionary commented) to shine the light of the Gospel. (CBN) This current case is a clarion call for the church globally to mobilize prayer, resource wise mission strategies, and support for those in perilous fields.4. Doctrine of Divine Sovereignty and Human AgencyWhile we affirm God’s sovereignty (Isaiah 46 : 9-10; Romans 8 28), we also recognise human agency and the pragmatic realities of security. The crisis invites reflection on how divine purposes intersect with human responsibility: preparing missionaries, supporting them logistically, and mobilizing the church in prayer.Practical Implications & RecommendationsFor the global mission community and local churches, this incident suggests several concrete actions:Heightened Prayer Mobilisation– Churches and ministries should schedule focused intercessory sessions for Kevin Rideout, the negotiating bodies, and all missionaries in high-risk zones.Missionary Care & Training– Agencies must revisit security protocols, evacuation plans, communication systems, and mental-health support for teams in unstable regions.Risk Assessment & Context Analysis– Before engaging in mission fields such as Niger, agencies should conduct rigorous context-analysis: security risks, political instability (e.g., the 2023 coup in Niger) (CBN), local church partnerships, and contingency strategies.Church Advocacy & Awareness– Local congregations globally should be briefed about the realities of mission work, the cost of discipleship, and the role of support (prayer, finances, awareness) in sustaining missionaries.Ethical and Spiritual Reflection– The church must ensure that missions are not romanticised beyond reality—missionary work is service, sacrifice, and often perilous. Theologically informed reflection can help the church hold both hope and realism.ConclusionAt Shimba Theological Institute, we stand in solidarity with the missionary community and call the body of Christ topray without ceasing(1 Thessalonians 5 : 17) for Kevin Rideout’s safe return, for the peace of his family, the agency involved, and the church at large.This incident is a sober reminder that the Great Commission (Matthew 28 : 18-20) is undertaken not from a place of safety alone but in the tension of proclamation and peril. We echo the apostle’s words: “We do not lose heart” (2 Corinthians 4 : 1), trusting that even in the darkest valleys, He is with us (Psalm 23 : 4).Let us mobilise the church in prayer, sharpen our mission practices, and remain steadfast in the hope which does not disappoint (Romans 5 : 5).Prayer Focus:For Kevin Rideout: protection, clarity, safe release.For his family and agency: comfort, wisdom, counsel.For missionary personnel working in high-risk fields: endurance, support, safe operations.For church leaders: discernment in sending and supporting cross-cultural missions.For the Gospel to continue advancing in regions overshadowed by fear and violence.Prepared by Shimba Theological Institute – Lights of Theology in a Darkened Worldapnews.com",

    "full_content": "Abraham Never Built the Kaʿbah — A Scholarly ExaminationBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba — Shimba Theological InstituteAbstract (short).This article examines the widely held Islamic tradition that Abraham (Ibrāhīm) and his son Ismāʿīl built the Kaʿbah in Mecca, and it evaluates six assertions commonly made in Christian critiques: (1) Abraham never visited Mecca; (2) Abraham did not build the Black Stone nor did it fall from the sky in the manner commonly described in later tradition; (3) Abraham made altars opposite a sacred stone but not the Kaʿbah as known in Islamic tradition; (4) the “Valley of Baca” (Psa lm 84) is not identical with Bakka/Makkah; (5) the “pilgrimage” language in Psalm 84 is not a reference to Hajj at the Kaʿbah; and (6) the well where Hagar found water in Genesis is not necessarily the Zamzam of Mecca. The evidence shows that the Abraham–Kaʿbah connection is a powerful and ancienttraditionwithin Islam, but it is not independently attested by contemporary extra-Qurʾānic sources or archaeology in a way that would confirm the historicist claims made in later communal memory. Where the sources are ambiguous or interpretive, this paper exposes the contested nature of the identifications and recommends careful, cautious conclusions.IntroductionMuslim tradition presents the Kaʿbah as the primeval “House” associated with Adam and later rebuilt by Abraham and Ismāʿīl (Qurʾānic formulation: “when Abraham and Ismail raised the foundations of the House…”). This narrative is doctrinally central within Islam and embedded in ritual memory (tawāf, Hajj rites, the place of Maqām Ibrāhīm, Zamzam, the Black Stone). Yet from the perspective of historical-critical inquiry, the claim that Abraham physically visited Mecca and (re)constructed the Kaʿbah in the Hejaz requires external corroboration — textual, epigraphic, or archaeological — which is thin or absent. The following sections analyse the evidence and alternative readings.1. Tradition versus independent historical evidenceClaim.Abraham never visited Mecca (no independent historical evidence he did).Evidence & argument.The Qurʾān and Islamic tradition clearly attribute the raising/rebuilding of the Kaʿbah to Abraham and Ismāʿīl; however, secular historical and archaeological surveys note the paucity of contemporaneous (e.g., Near Eastern, Byzantine, or South Arabian) records that tie Abraham — a patriarchal figure of the second/third millennium BCE in Biblical chronology — to the Hejaz sanctuary. Modern reference works summarise both the Islamic tradition and the relative lack of independent evidence for a pre-Islamic Kaʿbah founded by Abraham in the exact form described by later Muslim exegesis.Encyclopedia Britannica+1Conclusion:The Abrahamic origin of the Kaʿbah is a theological/traditional claim with strong internal attestation in Islamic literature; it lacks external, datable archaeological corroboration that would demonstrate a historical, physical act by Abraham in Mecca.2. The Black Stone: tradition, later legend, and uncertain originClaim.Abraham never built the Black Stone from the sky; origin stories vary and are not historically verifiable.Evidence & argument.Islamic tradition recounts several origins for the Black Stone (al-Hajar al-Aswad): meteorite, relic from Adam, an angel turned to stone, etc. Medieval and later writers record these traditions, and modern commentators add geological speculation (some propose meteoritic origin). However, the stone has never been subjected to definitive modern scientific analysis (for obvious religious and political reasons), and scholarly treatments emphasise that accounts of celestial origin are traditions, not scientific proof.Wikipedia+1Conclusion:The Black Stone’s “from the sky” narrative belongs to devotional tradition and later apologetic exegesis; it cannot be treated as a historically established fact without independent physical analysis and corroboration.3. Abraham’s altars and the possibility of ritual sites distinct from the KaʿbahClaim.Abraham built altars to offer sacrifices opposite a stone, but this should not be conflated automatically with the later Kaʿbah structure in Mecca.Evidence & argument.Islamic exegetical tradition sometimes locates early patriarchal sanctities (altars, stations of prayer) within a broader sacred geography attributed to Abraham. Early texts and later tafsīr narrate that Abraham found the Black Stone and (re)established a sanctuary; yet these retellings function to sacralise the Meccan shrine and properly integrate it into Abrahamic lineage. From the historian’s viewpoint, such narrative moves are common in religious traditions that link local shrines to revered ancestors. Comparative scholarship treats such reports as theological legitimations rather than independent chronicles of construction works.Encyclopedia Britannica+1Conclusion:References to altars and sacrifices associated with Abraham are important for devotional history but do not demonstrate a straightforward archaeological claim that ties Abraham physically to the extant Kaʿbah complex.4. The Valley of Baca (Baka/Bakkah) — biblical text and identificationsClaim.The valley of Baca in Psalm 84 is not (demonstrably) the Valley of Mecca/Bakkah.Evidence & argument.Psalm 84 (a pilgrimage psalm) uses the Hebrew termBaca(בכא/“baká( )”/“weeping” or “balsam”), typically understood in Jewish and Christian exegesis as a local valley in or near ancient Israel (possible identifications include the Valley of Rephaim or others). Islamic interpreters read the QurʾānicBakkah(Q 3:96) as Mecca and some Muslim exegetes connect Psalmic language to Mecca retrospectively. Secular and revisionist scholars (e.g., Tom Holland; and various source-critical authors) point out that the HebrewBakhaand ArabicBakkahare separate lexical items and that identification of the Psalm’s valley with Mecca is not linguistically or historically compelled. The scholarly literature therefore treats the identification as speculative, often motivated by theological correlation rather than direct evidence.Bible Hub+1Conclusion:Psalm 84’s “Valley of Baca” is best read in its immediate canonical and Israelite setting; linking it to Mecca requires assumptions that go beyond the biblical text and into comparative theological reading.5. Psalm 84 and the idea of “pilgrimage” — not HajjClaim.The pilgrimage language in Psalm 84 is not description of the Islamic Hajj to the Kaʿbah.Evidence & argument.Psalm 84 is part of the Israelite pilgrimage/temple psalmody tradition (pilgrimage to Zion, the Temple). Its language — “blessed are those who dwell in your house… they journey from strength to strength” — is framed by Israelite cultic practice and geography (Jerusalem/Zion). While some modern readers attempt to read Psalm 84 typologically vis-à-vis later pilgrimage forms (including Hajj), the historical context and the Israelite cultic horizon make a direct identification with Hajj or the Kaʿbah anachronistic.Explore the Bible+1Conclusion:The Psalm is best explained within Israelite cultic-pilgrimage imagination; equating it to Hajj represents a theological reading, not an exegesis grounded in the Psalm’s own historical setting.6. Hagar, Ishmael, and the water: Zamzam vs. Genesis wellsClaim.The water associated with Hagar in Genesis is not necessarily the Zamzam well of Mecca.Evidence & argument.Genesis 21:14–21 recounts Hagar and Ishmael in the wilderness, God opening a well (Hebrewmiqweh/ma‘in), and their survival. Islamic tradition locates a parallel event at Mecca (Zamzam), and later Islamic historiography identifies the site and ritualises Safa–Marwah and the well. The narratives have similar motifs (divine water for the abandoned child), but the Genesis narrative is set in the Negev/Beersheba or surrounding region (patriarchal south of Canaan), and there is no explicit biblical geography of Mecca. The tradition that equates the Genesis well with Zamzam is thus an inter-religious identification that post-dates the biblical text and belongs to the Islamic sacred-historical mapping of Abrahamic memory onto the Hejaz.Wikipedia+1Conclusion:The shared motifs do not by themselves prove identity of locations; the Genesis text does not mention Mecca or Zamzam.7. Summary and balanced assessmentStrong internal tradition.Islamic texts (Qurʾān and hadīth corpus; classical tafsīr) and continuous devotional practice robustly affirm Abraham’s role vis-à-vis the Kaʿbah, the Black Stone, Zamzam, and the sanctity of Makkah/Bakkah. This is the baseline of Muslim belief and community memory.Encyclopedia Britannica+1Lack of independent, contemporary corroboration.From a historical-critical vantage point, there is no external contemporaneous record (Near Eastern inscriptions, Byzantine or South Arabian records) that corroborates in detail an act of Abrahamian construction in the Hejaz; archaeological evidence for a continuous, datable structure back to the patriarchal era is not available. Scholarly literature accordingly distinguishes tradition from verifiable history.Oxford Bibliographies+1Textual-linguistic caution.The HebrewBaca/Bakhaand ArabicBakkahare similar-looking to modern readers but have distinct philological histories; mapping Psalmic valleys to Mecca requires methodological caution and additional positive evidence.Wikipedia+1Tradition as identity-forming narrative.The Abraham–Kaʿbah tradition is a powerful identity and legitimating narrative. Its religious force is real even where extra-Islamic historical verification is not forthcoming.

    "full_content": "A Scholarly Debate on Ishmael’s Lineage and the Ethnic Origins of MuhammadBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThe Islamic tradition holds that the Prophet Muhammad is a direct descendant of Ishmael, the son of Abraham and Hagar. This genealogical claim is foundational to Islamic identity, as it connects Muhammad—and therefore Islam—to the Abrahamic covenantal line. However, when examined through both scriptural and historical lenses, this claim raises several inconsistencies. A critical question arises:if Ishmael’s mother was Egyptian and his wife was also Egyptian, does this not imply that his descendants—if traceable—would be African rather than Arabian?This academic inquiry aims to provoke a theological and historical debate by juxtaposing the biblical narrative with Islamic claims. The purpose is not to diminish faith but to invite reasoned dialogue rooted in textual integrity and historical truth.1. The Biblical Account: Ishmael’s African ConnectionAccording toGenesis 16:1–12andGenesis 21:9–21, Hagar, the mother of Ishmael, was an Egyptian handmaiden of Sarah. Later, asGenesis 21:21records, Hagar took a wife for Ishmaelfrom the land of Egypt. This means Ishmael was the child of an Egyptian mother and married an Egyptian woman—making both his maternal and marital lines African in origin.Rabbinic commentary inGenesis Rabbah 53:15reinforces this by citing the proverb:“Throw a stick into the air, and it will always fall on its end.”In context, this saying means that Hagar, being Egyptian, naturally chose an Egyptian wife for her son.Thus, if Ishmael’s lineage continued biologically,his offspring would have carried Egyptian (African) blood.2. The Islamic Claim: Muhammad as a Descendant of IshmaelIslamic tradition asserts that Muhammad descended from Ishmael through his sonKedar(Qidar). This claim, however, lacks direct historical documentation before Islam emerged in the 7th century CE. There existsno continuous genealogical recordlinking Ishmael to Muhammad. The genealogy is largely retrospective—constructed after Muhammad’s lifetime to affirm his prophetic legitimacy within the Abrahamic line.Critical Questions:Where is the documented genealogical chain from Ishmael to Muhammad found before the 7th century?How can Ishmael’s African lineage be reconciled with the claim that Muhammad was purely Arab?If Arabs claim descent from Ishmael, does this not also imply that they share African ancestry through Hagar?Why do many Muslims reject any notion that Muhammad could have had African blood when their own tradition connects Ishmael to Egypt?3. Historical and Ethnological AnalysisThe termEgyptianin the biblical sense refers to people ofNorth African descent, part of the Hamitic line (Genesis 10:6). Therefore, Ishmael’s genealogy is partly Hamitic through Hagar and his Egyptian wife, and partly Semitic through Abraham. Any claim of pure Semitic descent through Ishmael ignores this dual heritage.Furthermore, ancient Arab tribes such as theQedariteswere nomadic groups in northwestern Arabia, but their ethnic composition was not uniform. Archaeological and linguistic evidence suggests significant African influence and intermarriage in those regions.If we accept the Islamic claim that Muhammad descended from Ishmael,logic dictates that Muhammad’s ancestry was at least partially African.Yet, this conclusion is often rejected in Islamic discourse, revealing a contradiction between faith-based genealogy and ethnological reality.4. The Debate: A Call for ConsistencyMuslims must face one of two possibilities:If Muhammad is indeed a descendant of Ishmael, then by scriptural and historical reasoning, he carried African (Egyptian) blood.If Muhammad was not African, then the claim that he descended from Ishmael collapses, since Ishmael’s lineage is inextricably tied to Egypt.Therefore, the question remains:“Can Islam uphold Muhammad’s Ishmaelite heritage without acknowledging his African ancestry?”If not, then perhaps the genealogical claim itself was theological rather than historical—a symbolic link to Abraham to grant Muhammad prophetic legitimacy.5. Scholarly ConclusionThis debate exposes a fundamental tension in Islamic historiography: the desire to connect Muhammad to Abraham through Ishmael, while distancing him from Africa through Hagar.But the biblical record is unambiguous—Hagar and Ishmael’s line began in Egypt.Hence, the argument concludes:Either Muhammad was an African by descent through Ishmael,Or he hadno genealogical connection to Ishmael at all.Until verifiable historical evidence bridges this 2,500-year genealogical gap, the claim remainsa theological assertion rather than a historical fact.Final Provocative Question:If Islam insists on an Abrahamic lineage through Ishmael, will it also embrace the African heritage inherent in that lineage—or continue to deny it in pursuit of an Arabized identity?By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

    "full_content": "MUHAMMAD IS WORSHIPPED BY BEASTS AND TREES: A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF AÏSHA’S TESTIMONYBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis paper examines a controversial Hadith narrated by Aisha, the wife of Prophet Muhammad, as recorded inJamiʿ al-Tirmidhi Hadith 3270. The narration reports that animals and trees prostrated before Muhammad, implying an act of worship. The Companions, amazed by this act, suggested that they too should prostrate before him. This Hadith raises deep theological questions about the nature of worship, the distinction between servitude to God and reverence for a human, and the boundaries of Islamic monotheism (tawḥīd). The paper seeks to evaluate the theological, logical, and Qur’anic inconsistencies that emerge from this narration.The Quoted HadithAl-Tirmidhi, Hadith 3270— Narrated by Aisha:\"Once when Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) was with a number of the Emigrants and Helpers, a camel came and prostrated itself before him. Thereupon his Companions said, ‘Messenger of Allah, beasts and trees prostrate themselves before you, but we have the greatest right to do so.’ He replied, ‘Worship your Lord and honor your brother. If I were to order anyone to prostrate himself before another, I should order a woman to prostrate herself before her husband. If he were to order her to convey stones from a yellow mountain to a black one, or from a black mountain to a white one, it would be incumbent on her to do so.’\"(Transmitted by Ahmad and al-Tirmidhi)Theological and Logical InquiryAisha’s narration introduces profound theological implications that challenge Islamic monotheism (Tawḥīd al-ʿUlūhiyyah). The fact that animals and trees allegedlyprostrated before Muhammadimplies an act of reverence reserved for divine beings. In Islam,sujūd(prostration) is a distinct form of worship that belongs exclusively to Allah (Surah 41:37; 22:18). Thus, if non-human creation performed this before Muhammad, several critical questions arise:Did the animals and trees commit shirk (idolatry)?According toSurah al-Anbiyāʾ 21:98–99,“Indeed, you and what you worship besides Allah are the fuel of Hell. You will surely enter it. If those had truly been gods, they would not have entered it, but all will abide therein forever.”This verse condemns all beings that are worshipped besides Allah. If animals and trees prostrated before Muhammad, does this not make him the object of their worship?Why did Allah allow this to occur?If Muhammad is truly a mere messenger (rasūl), how does divine permission extend to acts of prostration toward him by creation? Is this not in contradiction withSurah 41:37which states,“Do not prostrate to the sun or to the moon, but prostrate to Allah who created them.”Was Aisha mistaken or fabricating?As the Prophet’s wife, Aisha’s report holds significant authority in Islamic tradition. However, if the Hadith implies the Prophet accepted worship (even passively), it undermines the Qur’anic command inSurah 18:110:“Say, I am only a human being like you, to whom it has been revealed that your God is one God.”If Aisha’s account is authentic, then it portrays Muhammad in a position of divinity rather than prophethood.Exegetical Tension: Worship vs. HonorThe Prophet’s response—“Worship your Lord and honor your brother”—appears to distance himself from direct worship. Yet, the narrative fails to address why the camel and trees were permitted to perform prostration. The Companions’ statement,“Beasts and trees prostrate before you, but we have the greatest right to do so,”reveals that even early Muslims perceived this as an act ofveneration, if not worship.This suggests an early tendency towardprophetic exaltation, later seen inShama’il al-Muhammadiyyahand Sufi traditions where Muhammad is described as the “Light of Creation” (Nūr Muḥammadī). The narrative, therefore, exposes an evolving theology that blurs the line between devotion to Allah and reverence for His messenger.Philosophical and Theological ImplicationsFrom a theological standpoint, the Hadith leads to a paradox:If the beasts and trees truly worshipped Muhammad,shirkwas committed.If they did not, the Hadith contradicts its own narrative, rendering itmythological or metaphorical.Either outcome undermines the integrity of Hadith transmission or Islamic theology of pure monotheism.Furthermore, this account echoesancient pagan reverencewhere nature worshipped semi-divine heroes and kings—suggesting the possiblesyncretic incorporationof earlier cultural myths into Hadith literature.ConclusionThe Hadith of Aisha (al-Tirmidhi 3270) remains a profound theological problem within Islamic orthodoxy. It implies that Muhammad received a form of worship from creation, contradicting the Qur’an’s uncompromising monotheism. Whether this account is allegorical or literal, it exposes atension between prophetic humanity and divine exaltationin early Islamic narratives. The narration attributed to Aisha thus becomes a critical text for examiningthe evolution of Muhammad’s deificationin post-Qur’anic traditions.BibliographyAl-Tirmidhi, Abu Isa Muhammad ibn Isa.Jamiʿ al-Tirmidhi, Hadith 3270.Ahmad ibn Hanbal.Musnad Ahmad, Vol. 6, Hadith No. 25512.The Qur’an, Surah 18:110; 21:98–99; 22:18; 41:37.Ibn Kathir, Ismail.Tafsir al-Qur’an al-Azim.Dar al-Fikr, Beirut, 1998.Al-Bukhari, Muhammad ibn Ismail.Sahih al-Bukhari.Crone, Patricia.Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam.Princeton University Press, 1987.Wansbrough, John.Quranic Studies: Sources and Methods of Scriptural Interpretation.Oxford University Press, 1977.Shimba, Maxwell.Theological Paradoxes in Islamic Texts: A Comparative Inquiry.Shimba Theological Institute Press, 2025.",

    "full_content": "Divine Uncertainty in Qur’an 47:28: A Theological Inquiry into Allah’s “Installation”By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis article investigates the peculiar expression inQur’an 47:28, where Allah is portrayed as “installing” or “setting” (imlāʾ) something within the disbelievers, which raises profound questions about divine certainty, omniscience, and intentionality in the Qur’anic text. The study employs comparative theological analysis, hermeneutical exegesis, and linguistic critique to uncover whether the verse implies divine uncertainty or a reactive, rather than sovereign, mode of action in Allah’s dealings with human beings.1. Introduction: The Problem of Divine Intention in Qur’an 47:28Qur’an 47:28 states:“That is because they followed what angered Allah and disliked what pleased Him, so He made their deeds fruitless.”(Qur’an 47:28, Sahih International)However, several classical and modern translations also render key verbs in ways that suggestinstallation,deliberate placement, orallowance— terms which carry semantic connotations of gradual process, testing, or even hesitation. The Arabic phrasefa-ahbaṭa a‘mālahum(“so He made their deeds fruitless”) and related interpretive commentaries imply an intervention that occursafter observation, not by predetermined decree.This raises critical theological questions:If Allah’s omniscience is perfect, why must He “install” or “set” reactions after observing human choices?Does this imply that Allah’s judgment is contingent upon unfolding events?How can an all-knowing deity “test” what He already knows with absolute certainty?2. Linguistic and Exegetical Analysis of “Installation” (إملاء)The Arabic termimlāʾ(from the rootm-l-y) occurs in several Qur’anic passages (e.g., 3:178; 7:183), often translated as “granting respite,” “installing,” or “allowing delay.” This verb is sometimes used to describe Allah’s extended patience toward sinners before punishment.Yet, the morphology of the word suggestsprocessrather thanfinality. It depicts a deity who acts through stages, waiting, observing, and then implementing outcomes based on human response.In classicaltafsīrworks (e.g.,Tafsir al-Tabari,Tafsir al-Qurtubi), scholars attempted to reconcile this with Allah’s omniscience by claiming thatimlāʾrefers to divine testing (ibtilāʾ). However, testing presupposes uncertainty about the test’s result — a philosophical contradiction to omniscience.This invites deeper inquiry:Why does Allah “grant time” or “install” disbelief rather than instantaneously decreeing it?Doesimlāʾreflect a temporal learning process within Allah’s actions?Can a timeless being operate within temporal delay?3. Theological Implications: Is Allah Reactive or Proactive?The Qur’an often portrays Allah asreactingto human behavior: rewarding faith, cursing disbelief, or altering decrees based on obedience (Qur’an 13:39; 8:53). InQur’an 47:28, this reactive tendency is evident — Allah responds to their dislike of what pleases Him by nullifying their deeds.In contrast, the Biblical God declares,“I am the Lord, I change not”(Malachi 3:6) and“Known unto God are all His works from the beginning of the world”(Acts 15:18). The Biblical framework depicts omniscience as an eternal constancy, not adaptive reaction.Hence, the question arises:Does the Qur’an’s Allah act sequentially, responding to events as they occur?If so, can divine knowledge in Islam be truly eternal and unchanging?Does Allah’s “installation” of delay suggest dependence on human decision-making to complete His will?4. The Problem of Divine Psychology: Is Allah Testing Himself?If Allah’s “installation” implies that He must observe before judging, this introduces a divine cognitive process resemblinghuman reasoning. This anthropomorphic depiction contradicts the classical Islamic doctrine oftanzīh(absolute transcendence), which asserts that Allah is beyond time, space, and human emotion.Yet, Qur’an 47:28 and related verses describe Allah as being angered, pleased, or testing believers. Such human-like emotions raise theological tension:Can an immutable being become “angry” or “pleased”?Is Allah’s decision-making process an evolving response rather than a predetermined decree?If Allah installs disbelief or guidance progressively, is He learning from human actions?5. Comparative Reflection: Divine Certainty in the Bible vs. Qur’anIn the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures, God’s foreknowledge precedes creation itself (Isaiah 46:10; Romans 8:29). There is no notion of divine installation or delay because God’s decrees are absolute, not observational.By contrast, the Qur’anic Allah’s behavior appears inconsistent with omniscient sovereignty. He “tests” to know (Qur’an 47:31), “changes” decrees (Qur’an 13:39), and “installs” or “grants time” (Qur’an 47:28; 3:178).Thus, the philosophical debate centers on whether the Qur’anic portrayal of Allah reflectsepistemic limitation— an unfolding divine consciousness tied to time and human action — or whether these are merely metaphors misunderstood by interpreters.6. Conclusion: A Call for Re-examining Qur’anic TheismQur’an 47:28 exposes deep theological ambiguity. The “installation” language challenges the coherence of Allah’s omniscience, sovereignty, and immutability. The Qur’an’s God appears to operate within temporal frameworks, responding to human choices rather than governing from eternal certainty.This invites broader philosophical and theological questions:If Allah must install, test, or wait, can He be truly omniscient?Is the Qur’an’s deity engaged in temporal trial and error?Does this reveal an evolving concept of God in early Islamic theology?Or does it point to a fundamentally human authorship behind the Qur’an, reflecting psychological projection rather than divine omniscience?ReferencesThe Qur’an, Surah 47:28, 3:178, 7:183, 13:39, 8:53, 47:31.Al-Tabari,Jāmiʿ al-Bayān ʿan Taʾwīl Āy al-Qurʾān.Al-Qurtubi,Al-Jāmiʿ li-Aḥkām al-Qurʾān.Ibn Kathir,Tafsir al-Qur’an al-ʿAzim.Cragg, Kenneth.The Event of the Qur’an: Islam in Its Scripture.

Ndiyo maana nalisema wazi kuwa hii nimsumari wa mwisho kwenye jeneza la Uislamu.KatikaSuratul Hajj, Aya ya 40, Qur’an yenyewe inatamka kwa uwazi kuhusu aina mbalimbali za majengo ya ibada. Imeorodhesha “nyumba za watawa,” “makanisa,” “masinagogi,” na “misikiti.” Swali la msingi na la kufikirisha ni hili:Kama kweli Sinagogi ni sawa na Misikiti, kwa nini Qur’an inavitofautisha kwa majina na kuyaweka kama taasisi tofauti?Aya inasema:“Wale ambao wametolewa majumbani mwao pasipo haki, ila kwa kuwa wanasema: Mola wetu Mlezi ni Mwenyezi Mungu! Na lau kuwa Mwenyezi Mungu hawakingi watu kwa watu, basi hapana shaka zingelivunjwa nyumba za wat’awa, na makanisa, na masinagogi, na misikiti, ambamo ndani yake jina la Mwenyezi Mungu linatajwa kwa wingi. Na bila shaka Mwenyezi Mungu humsaidia yule anayemsaidia Yeye. Hakika Mwenyezi Mungu ni Mwenye Nguvu, Mtukufu.”(Suratul Hajj: 40)Tafakari kwa makini maneno haya:Nyumba za watawa– Hizi ni sehemu ambazo watawa wa Kikristo walijitenga kwa maombi na ibada.Makanisa– Majengo ya Wakristo yaliyotengwa mahsusi kwa ajili ya ibada ya Mungu.Masinagogi– Nyumba za ibada za Wayahudi, ambako Torati ilisomwa na jina la Mungu wa Israeli likatajwa.Misikiti– Hapa ndipo Waislamu walipokusanyika kwa ibada zao.Kwa nini Qur’an isiunganishe yote haya kama kitu kimoja kama kweli ni ibada ya Mungu mmoja? Ikiwa Sinagogi na Msikiti ni kitu kimoja, basi uorodheshaji huu ungekuwa wa kurudia rudia tu, jambo ambalo lingeharibu hata ufasaha wa maandiko.Hii inafunua mambo makubwa mawili:Kwanza, Qur’an inakiri kwa uwazi kwamba kabla ya Muhammad, tayari kulikuwepo na nyumba nyingi za ibada zinazotofautiana – Wayahudi na Wakristo walishamjua Mungu na walishamwabudu kwa karne nyingi kupitia Sinagogi na Makanisa.Pili, aya hii inaweka wazi kwamba Misikiti ni taasisi mpya iliyoibuka tu baada ya Muhammad. Hii inaondoa madai ya Waislamu kwamba Uislamu ulikuwepo tangu zama za Nabii Ibrahim au kwamba dini zote za awali zilikuwa na “Uislamu.” Kama ingekuwa hivyo, basi Sinagogi zingetajwa kama Misikiti na Makanisa yangetambuliwa pia kama Misikiti.Kwa hiyo, Qur’an inajichanganya yenyewe. Inapojaribu kuhalalisha nafasi ya Uislamu, kwa bahati mbaya inakiri bila kujua kwamba dini za awali – Uyahudi na Ukristo – zilikuwa na utambulisho wao wa kipekee na wa kweli wa ibada.Ukweli huu unathibitisha hoja yangu ya msingi:Uislamu ni mfumo ulioanzishwa na Muhammad karne ya 7 BK, na haukuwapo kabla yake.Ni dini ya kubuni yenye mkanganyiko, iliyoundwa ili kupinga na kuiga mafundisho ya Biblia.Kwa hiyo, swali kwa kila Msomaji Mwislamu ni hili:Kwa nini Qur’an yako inatofautisha kati ya Sinagogi na Misikiti?Ikiwa dini yako ndiyo dini ya kweli tangu mwanzo, kwa nini Qur’an iseme wazi kwamba Sinagogi na Makanisa yalikuwepo, yakitajwa jina la Mungu kwa wingi?Kwa nini Allah awape heshima Wayahudi na Wakristo kwa kutaja majengo yao ya ibada, kama kweli dini zao ni “zilizopotoshwa”?Ukitazama kwa macho ya uhalisia, hoja hizi zinabomoa kabisa msingi wa Uislamu.Ndio maana mimi,Max Shimba, mtumwa wa Yesu Kristo, nasema kwa ujasiri:Hakuna jina jingine limepewa wanadamu tupate wokovu, isipokuwa jina la Yesu Kristo.(Matendo 4:12).Hitimisho​Aya ya Qur’an katikaSuratul Hajj 40inafichua ukweli mzito usioweza kufichwa: kwamba dini ya Uislamu haikuwa na mizizi kabla ya Muhammad. Qur’an yenyewe inakiri kwa uwazi kwamba kabla ya kuzaliwa kwa Uislamu kulikuwepo na jamii zilizomtumikia Mungu kupitia nyumba zao za ibada – Sinagogi kwa Wayahudi, na Makanisa kwa Wakristo. Kwa kulitaja jambo hili, Qur’an imethibitisha kwamba kumjua Mungu si jambo lililozaliwa katika karne ya saba, bali lilianza maelfu ya miaka kabla ya Muhammad kupitia Agano la Kale na likakamilishwa kwa Kristo katika Agano Jipya.Kwa mantiki ya kifalsafa, hili linaibua maswali magumu kwa Uislamu:Kama dini ya kweli ni moja tu, kwa nini Qur’an itaje Sinagogi, Makanisa na Misikiti kama majengo tofauti?Ikiwa Uislamu ulikuwepo tangu zama za Ibrahim, kwa nini Sinagogi na Makanisa havikuitwa Misikiti?Kwa nini Qur’an ipe heshima majengo ya ibada ya Wayahudi na Wakristo, wakati Waislamu hufundishwa mara nyingi kwamba dini hizi zimepotoshwa?Kihistoria, Sinagogi zilianza karne nyingi kabla ya Kristo, baada ya Wayahudi kuhamishwa Babeli. Hapo ndipo walipojenga utamaduni wa kukusanyika, kusoma Torati, na kumtaja Mungu wa Israeli. Vivyo hivyo, Makanisa ya Kikristo yalizaliwa baada ya ufufuo wa Yesu Kristo, yakieneza injili na mafundisho ya upendo na wokovu. Kwa hiyo, Qur’an inapovihesabu majengo haya kama sehemu ambapo jina la Mungu linatajwa kwa wingi, inakiri moja kwa moja kwamba dini za Kiyahudi na Kikristo zilikuwa na uhalali na ushawishi mkubwa kabla ya Uislamu.Kimaandiko, Biblia yenyewe imethibitisha kwa karne nyingi kabla ya Muhammad kwamba wokovu ni kwa kupitia Yesu Kristo pekee. Mtume Petro alisema wazi:“Wala hakuna wokovu katika mwingine awaye yote; kwa maana hapana jina jingine chini ya mbingu walilopewa wanadamu, tupate wokovu kwalo, isipokuwa jina la Yesu Kristo.”(Matendo ya Mitume 4:12).Kwa hiyo, Qur’an inapojaribu kuhalalisha Misikiti kama sehemu ya ibada ya Mungu, inajichanganya kwa sababu inatambua kwamba Sinagogi na Makanisa pia ni sehemu ambapo jina la Mungu linasemwa. Hii inathibitisha kwamba Mungu wa kweli amejifunua tayari kupitia historia ya Uyahudi na umwilisho wa Yesu Kristo, na wala si kupitia mafundisho mapya ya Muhammad.Kwa mtazamo wa kiroho, hili linapaswa kumfanya kila Mwislamu afikirie kwa makini: Je, kweli dini yako inatoka kwa Mungu, au ni mfumo uliojengwa baadaye ili kuiga yale yaliyokuwepo? Je, kweli unaweza kujiokoa kwa kushikamana na dini iliyojaa mkanganyiko wa maandiko, au kwa kumpokea Yesu Kristo ambaye ndiye njia, kweli na uzima? (Yohana 14:6).Ukweli unabaki pale pale:Uislamu ni dini ya baadaye, iliyoanzishwa na Muhammad, na haina mizizi ya kweli katika historia ya wokovu. Njia ya kweli, iliyowekwa tangu Agano la Kale na kukamilishwa katika Agano Jipya, ni Yesu Kristo pekee.Kwa hiyo, msomaji mpendwa, chaguo liko mikononi mwako. Unaweza kuendelea kushikamana na dini ya wanadamu, au ukaamua kumfuata Yesu Kristo, ambaye ndiye nuru ya ulimwengu na mwokozi wa roho zako.Mimi niMax Shimba, mtumwa wa Yesu Kristo.",

Abdullah said: And so I stayed there. Then the Messenger of Allah went off a stone’s throw away or a little farther (or something like that). Then he [Abdullah] mentioned a group of male members [haneen, i.e. men] who looked like Zutt people. ‘Affan narrated (or something like what ‘Affan said, Allah willing):They didn’t have any clothes on, and I didn’t see their genitals, and they were tall and scrawny. He [Abdullah] said:And they came and started to ride [yarkaboun] the Messenger of Allah, and the Prophet of Allah began to recite to them. And they started to move closer and lean around me, and get in my way,and I became intensely terrified of them, so I sat down (or something like that). And when the morning light broke, they began to go away (or something like that).Then the Messenger of Allah came back exhausted and in pain, or practically in pain, from how they had ridden him; He said:Indeed I am exhausted (or something like that). Then the Messenger of Allah put his head in my lap (or something like that). And the men came with tall white garments on, but the Messenger of Allah had fallen asleep. And I became more intensely terrified of them than I was the first time.‘Arim said in his hadith: Then some of them said to the others: This man has been given good things (or something like that) – indeed his eyes sleep – or they said: His eye (or something like that) – but his heart is awake. ‘Arim and ‘Affan narrated: Some of them said to the others: Come, let us make a riddle about him (or something like that). And some of them said to the others: Make a riddle about him, and we will solve it – or: We will make a riddle, and you all can solve it. Then some of them said to the others: He is like a master, who built a well-fortified building, then sent out food to people (or something like that) and whoever does not take his food – or he said: Whoever does not follow him – He punishes him severely (or something like that). And the others replied: Indeed the master is the Lord of the Worlds, and indeed the building is Islam, and the food isJannah, and this is he who bids people to come; and whoever follows after him will be inJannah. ‘Arim said in his hadith (or something like it) – and whoever does not follow after him will be punished (or something like that). Then the Messenger of Allah woke up and said: What did you see, oh Ibn Umm ‘Abd? And Abdullah said: I saw this and that. And the Prophet of Allah said: Nothing of what they said has been hidden from me? The Prophet of Allah said: They were a group of angels – or He said: They were angels. (Or whatever Allah wills.)

Muhammad ibn al-Husayn and Ali ibn Muhammad from Sahl ibn Ziyad from Muhammad ibn al-Walid Shabab al-Sayrafi from Aban ibn ‘Uthman from Abi ‘Abdillah  who has said the following “When the Messenger of Allah was about to die, he called to him al-‘Abbas Bbn ‘Abd al-Muttalib and Amir al-Mu’minin . He said to al-‘Abbas, “O uncle of Muhammad, will you inherit the legacy of Muhammad, pay his debts and fulfill his promises and commitments?” He responded, “O the Messenger of Allah, may Allah take my soul and the souls of my parents in service for your cause, I am an old man with a large number of dependents, with very little belongings while in generosity compete the winds.” He (the Messenger of Allah) said, “I will give them away to whoever would want them along with its rights and responsibilities.” Then he (s.a.) said, “O Ali, brother of Muhammad, will you pay off the liabilities of Muhammad, pay off his debt and take possession of his legacy?” He said, “Yes, May Allah take my soul and the soul of my parents in service for your cause, it is my responsibility and in my favor” He has said, “I looked at him and saw him take off even his ring from his finger and said to me: Wear this ring in my lifetime.” He (Ali) has said, “I looked at the ring when I wore it on my finger and wished to have it out of all his properties.” He then called upon Bilal loudly, “Bring me my helmet, the coat of arms, the flag, the Shirt, the Dhulfaqar (famous sword), al-Sahab, (the Turban) al-Burd, (the cloth), al-Abraqa, (the belt) and the staff.”Ali has said, “I had never before seen that belt. When it was brought its shine would almost take away one’s sight. It was of the belts of paradise.” He (the Messenger of Allah) then said, “O Ali, Jibril brought this for me and said, “O Muhammad, place it in the ring of the coat of arms and use it as a belt around your midsection. Then he asked that the two pairs of Arabian shoves be brought to him along with the shirt. One of them was already stitched and the other was not yet stitched. It was the shirt with which he take for the ’Isra’ (the night journey), the shirt while wearing it he came out on the day of ’Uhud. Three caps were brought, the cap used while on a journey, the cap used on the ‘Id days and the cap used on Fridays. Also the cap that was used during his meeting with his companions was brought to him.” Then he (the Messenger of Allah) said, “O Bilal, bring to us the two mules, the gray one and Dul dul and the two camels, al-Ghadba’ and al-Qaswa’ and the two horses.” Al-Janah would be kept near the door of the Mosque in case the Messenger of Allah needed it. Whenever he would need anything he would let a man ride on it to go for the task and the horse would run for the needs of the Messenger of Allah. Also Hayzum was brought to him, the donkey called ‘Ufayr were brought to him. He then said, “Take possession of these in my lifetime.” Amir al-Mu’minin has said, “The first one of the animals died was‘Ufayr who died at within the same hour that the Messenger of Allah died. He broke off his bound until he began to run until he came to the well of Bani Khatma in Qibaand threw himself into it and it became his grave.” It is narrated that Amir al-Mu’minin has said, “That donkey spoke to the Messenger of Allah saying: May Allah take my soul and the soul of my parents in service for your cause,my father related to me from his father from his grandfather from his father who lived with Noah in the Ark. Once Noah came to himand whipped him on his backand said: “From the descendents of this donkey there will a donkey on whose back the master and the last of the prophets will ride.” I thank Allah who has made me that donkey.Sahih al-Kafi Shaykh Baqir al-BehbudiMirʾāt al-ʿUqūl fī Sharḥ Akhbār Āl al-Rasūl (3/44) Allamah Baqir al-Majlisi (Al-Kāfi – Volume 1,Book 4, Chapter #38,The Armaments and Sacred Items belonging to the Holy Prophet that transferred to the Imam)",

Worshipping others besides Allah isShirk(ascribing the unique characteristics and functions of Allah to a creature).Worship Allah and join none with Him in worship (Wa’abudoo Allaha wala tushrikoo), and do good to parents, kinsfolk, orphans,Al-Masakin(the poor), the neighbour who is near of kin, the neighbour who is a stranger, the companion by your side, the wayfarer (you meet), and those (slaves) whom your right hands possess. Verily, Allah does not like such as are proud and boastful; S. 4:36Verily,Allah forgives not that partners should be set up with him in worship, but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He pleases, and whoever sets up partners with Allah in worship, he has indeed invented a tremendous sin. S. 4:48 – Cf. 4:116; 2:223.  Invoking others besides Allah involvesUluhiyyah/Ibadah(worship/service).And invoke (tad’u) not any otherilah(god) along with Allah,La ilaha illa Huwa(none has the right to be worshipped but He). Everything will perish save His Face. His is the Decision, and to Him you (all) shall be returned. S. 28:884. According to certain Sahih reports, Muhammad exhorted his followers to invoke/supplicate (du’a) him, which they did even after his death.3578.‘Uthman bin Hunaif narrated that a blind man came to the Prophet and said to him: “Supplicate to Allah to heal me.” He said: “If you wish, I will supplicate for you, and if you wish, you can be patient, for that is better for you.” He said: “Then supplicate to him.” He said: “So he ordered him to performWudu’and to make hisWudu’complete, and to supplicate with this supplication: ‘O Allah, I ask You and turn towards You by Your Prophet Muhammad, the Prophet of Mercy. Indeed, I have turned to my Lord, BY MEANS OF YOU, concerning this need of mine, so that it can be resolved, So Allah so accept HIS INTERCESSION for me (Allahumma Inni As’aluka WA MUHAMMADIN Nabi-Ir-Rahmati Tawajjahtu Bika Ila Rabbi Fi Hajati Hadhihi Lituqda Li, Allahumma FASHAFFI‘HU Fiya).’”(SAHIH)[He said]: ThisHadithisHasan SAHIH Gharib, we do not know of it except through this route, as a narration of Abu Ja‘far, and he is someone other than Al-Khatmi, [and Uthman bin Hunaif is the brother of Sahl bin Hunaif] (English Translation of Jami‘ At-Tirmidhi: Compiled by Imam Hafiz Abu ‘Eisa Mohammad Ibn ‘Eisa At-Tirmidhi, translated by Abu Khaliyl (USA), ahadith edited and referenced by Hafiz Tahir Zubair ‘Ali Za’i [Darussalam Publishers & Distributors, First Edition: November 2007], Volume 6, From Hadith No. 3291 to 3956, Various Narrations On The Chapters Of Supplications, Chapter 118, p. 283http://sunnah.com/tirmidhi/48/209; capital and underline emphasis mine)Here is a different version of this same hadith:1385.It was narrated from ‘Uthman bin Hunaif that a blind man came to the Prophet and said to him: “Pray to Allah to heal me.” He said: “If you wish to store your reward for the Hereafter, that is better, or if you wish, I will supplicate for you.” He said: “Supplicate.” He said: “So he told him to perform ablution and do it well, and to pray twoRak’ah, and to say this supplication: “Allahumma inni as’aluka wa atawajjahu ilaika BI-MUHAMMADIN NABIYYIR-RAHMA.YA MUHAMMADU inni qad tawajjahtu bika ila rabbi fi hajati hadhihi Lituqda.

The man met Ibn Hunayf and complained to him about the matter – this being after the death (wisal) of the Prophet and after the caliphates of Abu Bakr and Umar – so Uthman ibn Hunayf, who was one of the Companions who collected hadiths and was learned in the religion of Allah, said: “Go to the place of ablution and perform ablution (wudu), then come to the mosque, perform two rak’as of prayer therein, and say:‘O Allah, I ask You and turn to Youthrough our Prophet Muhammad, the Prophet of mercy; O MUHAMMAD (Ya Muhammad), I turn through you to my Lord, that He may fulfill my need,’ and mention your need. Then come so that I can go with you [to the caliph Uthman].” So the man left and did as he had been told, then went to the door of Uthman ibn Affan, and the doorman came, took him by the hand, brought him to Uthman ibn Affan, and seated him next to him on a cushion. ‘Uthman asked, “What do you need?” and the man mentioned what he wanted, and Uthman accomplished it for him, then he said, “I hadn’t remembered your need until just now,” adding, “Whenever you need something, just mention it.” Then, the man departed, met Uthman ibn Hunayf, and said to him, “May Allah reward you! He didn’t see to my need or pay any attention to me until you spoke with him.” Uthman ibn Hunayf replied, “By Allah, I didn’t speak to him, but I have seen a blind man come to the Messenger of Allah and complain to him of the loss of his eyesight. The Prophet said, “Can you not bear it?’ and the man replied, ‘O Messenger of Allah, I do not have anyone to lead me around, and it is a great hardship for me.’ The Prophet told him, ‘Go to the place of ablution and perform ablution (wudu), then pray two rak’as of prayer and make the supplications.’” Ibn Hunayf went on, “By Allah, we didn’t part company or speak long before the man returned to us as if nothing had ever been wrong with him.”This is an explicit, unequivocal text from a prophetic Companion proving the legal validity of tawassul through the dead.The account has been classified as rigously authenticated (SAHIH) by Baihaqi, Mundhiri, and Haythami.

When the youths sought refuge in the cave, they said: Our Lord! grant us mercy from Thee, and provide for us a right course in our affair. So We prevented them from hearing in the cave for a number of years. Then We raised them up that We might know which of the two parties was best able to compute the time for which they remained. We relate to you their story with the truth; surely they were youths who believed in their Lord and We increased them in guidance. And We strengthened their hearts with patience, when they stood up and said: Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth; we will by no means call upon any god besides Him, for then indeed we should have said an extravagant thing. These our people have taken gods besides Him; why do they not produce any clear authority in their support? Who is then more unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah? And when you forsake them and what they worship save Allah, betake yourselves for refuge to the cave; your Lord will extend to you largely of His mercy and provide for you a profitable course in your affair. And you might see the sun when it rose, decline from their cave towards the right hand, and when it set, leave them behind on the left while they were in a wide space thereof. This is of the signs of Allah; whomsoever Allah guides, he is the rightly guided one, and whomsoever He causes to err, you shall not find for him any friend to lead (him) aright. And you might think them awake while they were asleep and We turned them about to the right and to the left, while their dog (lay) outstretching its paws at the entrance; if you looked at them you would certainly turn back from them in flight, and you would certainly be filled with awe because of them. And thus did We rouse them that they might question each other. A speaker among them said: How long have you tarried? They said: We have tarried for a day or a part of a day. (Others) said: Your Lord knows best how long you have tarried. Now send one of you with this silver (coin) of yours to the city, then let him see which of them has purest food, so let him bring you provision from it, and let him behave with gentleness, and by no means make your case known to any one: For surely if they prevail against you they would stone you to death or force you back to their religion, and then you will never succeed. And thus did We make (men) to get knowledge of them that they might know that Allah’s promise is true and that as for the hour there is no doubt about it. When they disputed among themselves about their affair and said:Erect an edifice over them— their Lord best knows them. Those who prevailed in their affair said:We will certainly raise a masjid over them. (Some) say: (They are) three, the fourth of them being their dog; and (others) say: Five, the sixth of them being their dog, making conjectures at what is unknown; and (others yet) say: Seven, and the eighth of them is their dog. Say: My Lord best knows their number, none knows them but a few; therefore contend not in the matter of them but with an outward contention, and do not question concerning them any of them. S. 18:9-22 ShakirNote how the following version translates the relevant part:Thus did We make their case known to the people, that they might know that the promise of God is true, and that there can be no doubt about the Hour of Judgment. Behold, they dispute among themselves as to their affair. (Some) said, “Construct a building over them”: Their Lord knows best about them: those who prevailed over their affair said, “Let us surely build a place of worship over them (alayhim masjidan).” S. 18:21 Y. AliAnd here’s the explanation given by some of Islam’s greatest expositors:And so just as We aroused them it was that We disclosed them to their people and the believers that they that is their people might know that God’s promise of resurrection is true by virtue of the fact that One Who has the power to make them sleep for such a long period of time or sustain them in that state without nourishment also has the power to resurrect the dead; and that as for the Hour there is no doubt no uncertainty concerning it. Behold idh adverbially qualifies a‘tharnā ‘We disclosed’ they were disputing that is the believers and the disbelievers among themselves their affair the affair of the youths with regard to building something around them as a monument; so they the disbelievers said ‘Build over them that is around them a building to cover them up; their Lord knows them best.’ Those who prevailed regarding their affair the affair of the youths namely the believers ‘We will verily set up over them around them a place of worship’for prayers to be performed therein. And this indeed took place at the entrance of the cave. (Tafsir al-Jalalaynhttps://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=0&tTafsirNo=74&tSoraNo=18&tAyahNo=21&tDisplay=yes&UserProfile=0&LanguageId=2; bold emphasis mine)(those who won their point said: “We verily, shall build a place of worship over them.”) Those who said this were the people of power and influence, but were they good people or notthere is some debate on this point, because the Prophet said…(Allah has cursed the Jews and the Christians who took the graves of their Prophets and righteous people as places of worship) Warning against what they did. We have reported about the Commander of the faithful `Umar bin Al-Khattab that when he found the grave of Danyal (Daniel) in Iraq during his period of rule, he gave orders that news of this grave should be withheld from the people, and that the inscription containing mention of battles etc., that they found there should be buried. (Tafsir Ibn Kathirhttps://www.alim.org/quran/tafsir/ibn-kathir/surah/18/21; bold emphasis mine)Ibn Kathir’s admission that there was some debate in respect to whether the people in this Islamic Rip Van Winkle story did something good by turning the resting place of these so-called sleepers into amasjidsince this contradicts Muhammad’s condemnation of such a practice illustrates the Muhammadan conundrum. It perfectly demonstrates Muhammad’s blatant inconsistency by providing further substantiation of how he would often do or say things in direct conflict with the Quran. After all, there is nothing in this fable suggesting that the Muslim deity disapproved of what the people did. It is merely the scholars’ realizing how their prophet’s sunna directly conflicts with the statements of his own book that led them to assume such in order to harmonize this blatant contradiction.It gets much worse.Muhammad made it obligatory for his followers to pray for him and even greet him in their prayers after his death:Abu Hurayra said that the Messenger of Allah said, “Whenever anyone greets me with peace, Allah will return my soul to me so that I can return the greeting.”Abu Bakr ibn Abi Shayba mentions that Abu Hurayra said that the Messenger of Allah said, “I WILL HEAR whoever blesses me at my grave. If someone is far away and blesses me, that is also conveyed to me.”…Ibn ‘Umar said, “Do a lot of prayer on your Prophet everyJumu’a. It is brought to him from you everyJumu’a.” One version has, “None of you blesses me but THAT HIS PRAYER IS SHOWN TO ME when he finishes it.”Al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali said that the Prophet said, “Bless me wherever you are. YOUR PRAYER will reach me.”One of them mentioned that the name of someone who blesses the Prophet IS SHOWN to the Prophet when he does it.Al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali said, “When you enter the mosque, greet the Prophet. The Messenger of Allah said, ‘Do not make my house a place of‘Idand do not make your houses graves. Bless me wherever you are. YOUR PRAYER will reach me wherever you are.’”…Sulayman ibn Suhyam said that he saw the Prophet in a dream and asked him, “Messenger ofAllah, do you recognise the greeting of those who come to you?” He replied, “YES, AND I ANSWER THEM.” (Qadi ‘Iyad Ibn Musa al-Yahsubi,Kitab Ash-shifa bi ta’rif huquq al-Mustafa (Healing by the recognition of the Rights of the Chosen One), translated by Aisha Abdarrahman Bewley English [Madinah Press, Inverness, Scotland, U.K., third reprint 1991, paperback], pp. 262-263; capital and underline emphasis mine)Notice how Muhammad himself classified the invocations and greetings that his followers were to offer to him assupplicationsandprayers. Muhammad is, therefore, personally responsible for the blatant idolatry that Muslims commit all over the world due to their invoking and speaking to a dead false prophet.And this notion of Muhammad being able to see the prayers of his followers even after his death is substantiated within the Quran itself:They will excuse themselves to you when you go back to them. Say: Urge no excuse, by no means will we believe you; indeed Allah has informed us of matters relating to you;and now Allah and His Apostle WILL SEE your doings (wa’sayara Allahu amalakum wa’rasooluhu), then you shall be brought back to the Knower of the unseen and the seen, then He will inform you of what you did. S. 9:94 ShakirThe word for “will see” (sayara) is a 3rd person masculine singular imperfect verb, and is in the subjunctive mood. The verse literally reads, “” Allah and his apostle,HEwill see.”Muhammad, therefore, made Allah’s seeing identical with his own sight, which in turn makes him omniscient and omnipresent like his god!To make matters much worse and more blasphemous than they already are, the Quran depicts Muhammad as being able to cleanse and purify his followers from their sins!Take alms out of their property,you would cleanse them and purify them thereby, and pray for them;surely your prayer is a relief to them; and Allah is Hearing, Knowing. S. 9:103 ShakirThat’s not all.Some of Islam’s most notable scholars have used Q. 4:64 to argue that Muslims can actually visit their dead prophet’s grave in order to personally ask him for his intercession. And this is exactly what Muhammadans have been doing since the demise of Muhammad:Although, this verse (64) was revealed in the background of a particular incident relating to hypocrites, yet its words yield a general ruling which stipulates that anyone who presents himself before the Holy Prophet and he prays for his forgiveness, he will be definitely forgiven. And ‘the presence before the Prophet,’ as it would have been during his blessed life in this mortal world, HOLDS THE SAME EFFECT EVEN TODAY as the visit to the sacred precincts of the Mosque of the Prophet and the act of ‘presenting’ oneself BEFORE THE BLESSED RESIDENT OF THE SANCTIFIED MAUSOLEUM FALLS WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF THIS RULE.Sayyidna ‘Ali has said: “Three days after we all had finished with the burial of the Messenger of Allah a villager came and fell down close to the blessed grave. Weeping bitterly, he referred to this particular verse of the Qur’an AND ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO THE BLESSED GRAVE, he said: ‘Allah Almighty has promised in this verse that a sinner, if he presented himself before theRasulof Allah, and theRasulelects to pray for his forgiveness, then he will forgive him. Therefore, here I am, presenting myself BEFORE YOU so that I may be blessed with YOUR prayer for my forgiveness.’ People personally present there at that time say that, in response to the pleading of the villager, a voice coming out from the sanctified mausoleum rang around with the words… You have been forgiven.” (al-Bahr al-Muhit) (Mufti Shafi Usmani,Maariful Quran, Volume 2, p. 486https://www.kalamullah.com/Books/Maariful%20Quran/English-MaarifulQuran-MuftiShafiUsmaniRA-Vol-2-Page-451-505.pdf; capital emphasis mine)And:“Allah is instructing the sinners when they commit a sin to come to the messenger of Allah and ask forgiveness in his presence and then they ask him to request forgiveness. And certainly if they did that, Allah would relent towards them and have mercy on them, and for that reason He said “they would have found Allah Oft-Returning, Merciful.”And Shaykh Mansur as-Sabbagh recollected in his book “The Perfections” (ash-Shama’il) the well-known (famous) transmission from ‘Utbi:“I was sitting by the grave of the Prophetand a Bedouin came and said: ‘Peace be upon you O Prophet of Allah. I heard Allah say: “And if they had come to thee when they had wronged their souls, and asked forgiveness of Allah, and if the Messenger had also asked forgiveness for them, they would have surely found Allah Oft-Returning with compassion and Merciful.”And I came to you asking forgiveness for my sin, taking you as intercessor to my Lord.’“Then he started reciting verses: ‘O You best of those whose bones are buried in al-Qa’a from the sweet scents of those bones the whole area of al-Qa’a and Akamu became perfumed.My self I sacrifice to the grave that you live in it is purity and in it is incredible generosity.’“Then the Bedouin departed and sleep overcame me.And I saw the Prophet in my sleep and he said: ‘Ya ‘Utbi, follow the Bedouin and give him the glad tidings that Allah has forgiven him.’” (Ibn Kathir,Tafsir of Qur’an al-Adheem[Dar al-Fikr, Beirut, 1992/1412], Volume 1, p. 643)It is apparent why Muslim scholars permitted such an idolatrous and blasphemous practice,According to the verse in question, Muhammad’s intercession is essential and necessary to obtain forgiveness:And We did not send any apostle but that he should be obeyed by Allah’s permission; and had they, when they were unjust to themselves,come to youand asked forgiveness of Allahand the Apostle had (also) asked forgiveness for them, they would have found Allah Oft-returning (to mercy), Merciful. S. 4:64 ShakirSince the Quran is supposed to be a source of guidance for all peoples at all times, not just at the time of Muhammad, this mean that passages such as the foregoing must still be applicable for all generations of Muslims. However, Muhammad is dead and the applicability of these injunctions are dependent on his followers being able to access his presence in order to benefit from his intercession.This leaves Muslims with one of two choices.Either these texts which require making contact with Muhammad are obsolete now that he is dead, which in turn makes the Quran an incoherent and impractical “revelation” seeing that much of its contents have become useless and unnecessary after Muhammad’s death. Or Muslims are still required to act upon these verses by going to the grave of Muhammad in order to contact a dead man whom they think is somehow still alive in his tomb.As the readers can see, some Islamic scholars chose the second view, which resulted in their doing the very thing that Muhammad cursed the Jews and Christians for doing. I.e., as a direct result of the teachings of the Quran and sunnah, Muslims have turned their prophet’s grave into a place of worship where they come and pray to a dead man to help save them from their sins!As if this weren’t shocking enough, certain Muslims would even face Muhammad’s grave rather than the Kabah whenever they would supplicate!It is just as necessary to have esteem and respect for the Prophet AFTER HIS DEATH AS IT WERE WHEN HE WAS ALIVE. This means to show it whenever the Prophet, hishadithorsunnaare mentioned, when anyone hears his name or anything about his life or how his family and relatives behaved. It includes respect for the People of his House (ah al-bayt) and his Companions…Abu Humayd said, “Abu Ja’far, theAmir al-Mu’minin, had a dispute with Malik in the Prophet’s mosque. Malik said to him, ‘Amir al-Mu’minin, do not raise your voice in this mosque. Allah taught the people how to behave by saying, ‘Do not raise your voices above the Prophet’(49:2) He praises people with the words,“Those who lower their voices in the presence of the Messenger of Allah.”(49:3) He censures people, saying,“Those who call you…”Respect for him WHEN HE IS DEAD is the same as respect for him when he was alive.”“Abu Ja’far was humbled by this. He asked Malik, ‘Abu Abdullah, do you faceqiblawhen you supplicate or do you face the Messenger of Allah?’ He replied, ‘Why would you turn your face from him when he is YOUR MEANS and the means of your father, Adam, to Allah on the Day of Rising? I face him and ASK HIM to intercede and Allah will grant his intercession. Allah says,“If, when you wronged yourselves, they had come to you.”’” (4:64) (Qadi ‘Iyad, pp. 237-238; capital and underline emphasis mine)With the foregoing in view, could it be any more obvious that Muhammad was an inconsistent hypocrite and idol-maker that did the very thing he condemned others for doing, and who turned himself into a god by causing his followers to look to him as an object of their worship?",

S. 9:24 Hilali-KhanYou (O Muhammad) will not find any people who believe in Allah and the Last Day, making friendship with thosewho oppose AllahANDHis Messenger (Muhammad), even though they were their fathers, or their sons, or their brothers, or their kindred (people). For such He has written Faith in their hearts, and strengthened them withRuh(proofs, light and true guidance) from Himself. And We will admit them to Gardens (Paradise) under which rivers flow, to dwell therein (forever). Allah is pleased with them, and they with Him. They are the Party of Allah. Verily, it is the Party of Allah that will be the successful. S. 58:22 Hilali-KhanIslam further commands Muslims to perfectly submit to Muhammad to the same extent and degree that they are supposed to submit to Muhammad’s god:But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you (O Muhammad) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions,and accept (them) with full submission. S. 4:65 Hilali-KhanThis is why obedience to Muhammad is the same as obeying Allah, and why a person must revert back to Muhammad’s decisions whenever scholars/leaders disagree:These are the limits (set by) Allah (or ordainments as regards laws of inheritance),and whosoever obeys AllahANDHis Messenger (Muhammad)will be admitted to Gardens under which rivers flow (in Paradise), to abide therein, and that will be the great success.And whosoever disobeys AllahANDHis Messenger (Muhammad), and transgresses His limits, He will cast him into the Fire, to abide therein; and he shall have a disgraceful torment. S. 4:13-14 Hilali-KhanO you who believe! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger (Muhammad), and those of you (Muslims) who are in authority. (And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves,refer it to Allah and His Messenger, if you believe in Allah and in the Last Day. That is better and more suitable for final determination. S. 4:59 Hilali-KhanHe who obeys the Messenger (Muhammad),has indeed obeyed Allah, but he who turns away, then we have not sent you (O Muhammad) as a watcher over them. S. 4:80 Hilali-KhanIt is not for a believer, man or woman, when AllahANDHis Messenger have decreed a matterthat they should have any option in their decision. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, he has indeed strayed in a plain error. S. 33:36 Hilali-KhanIn fact, obedience to Muhammad is so crucial for Muslim salvation that Allah absolutely refuses to love anyone who doesn’t obey his “prophet,” since he only loves those who surrender to Muhammad’s will:Say (O Muhammad to mankind): “If you (really) love Allah then follow me(i.e. accept Islamic Monotheism, follow the Qur’an and the Sunnah),Allah will love you and forgive you of your sins. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” Say (O Muhammad): “Obey Allah and the Messenger (Muhammad).” But if they turn away,then Allah does not like the disbelievers. S. 3:31-32 Hilali-KhanThe Muslim scripture makes it therefore explicitly clear that Muhammad has absolute, final authority and say-so over the lives of Muslims, since he pretty much owns them.Little wonder that Muslims are named “the followers of Muhammad” in the hadiths:Narrated Salim: I heard Um Ad-Darda’ saying, “Abu Ad-Darda’ entered the house in an angry mood. I said to him. ‘What makes you angry?’ He replied, ‘By Allah! I do not findthe followers of Muhammaddoing those good things (which they used to do before) except the offering of congregational prayer.” (This happened in the last days of Abu Ad-Darda’ during the rule of ‘Uthman). (Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 1, Book 11, Number 622https://www.searchtruth.com/book_display.php?book=11&translator=1&start=0&number=622)Narrated ‘Aisha: Allah’s Apostle said, “Ofollowers of Muhammad! There is none, who has a greater sense ofGhira(self-respect) than Allah, so He has forbidden that His slave commits illegal sexual intercourse or His slave girl commits illegal sexual intercourse. Ofollowers of Muhammad! If you but knew what I know, you would laugh less and weep more!” (Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 7, Book 62, Number 148https://www.searchtruth.com/book_display.php?book=62&translator=1&start=0&number=148)In light of the foregoing, I now furnish another explicit instance of Muslims deifying Muhammad by granting him the same devotion and service, which the Quran attributes to Allah.Note what these ahadith state in regards to Abu Bakr’s love and dedication to Muhammad:The Book of the Sunnah(11a) Chapter: The Virtue of Abu Bakr SiddiqIt was narrated that Abu Hurairah said:“The Messenger of Allah said: ‘The wealth of none of you has benefited me as much as the wealth of Abu Bakr.'” Abu Bakr wept and said: ‘O Messenger of Allah,I and my wealth areONLYfor you, O Messenger of Allah.'”Grade: Da’if(Darussalam)Reference: Sunan Ibn Majah 94In-book reference: Introduction, Hadith 94English translation: Vol. 1, Book 1, Hadith 94 (sunnah.comhttps://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:94)And:Abu Huraira reported: The Messenger of Allah said, “The wealth of no one has benefited me as much as the wealth of Abu Bakr.” Abu Bakr wept and he said, “My life and my wealth areONLYfor you, O Messenger of Allah.”Source: Musnad Aḥmad 7397Grade:Sahih(authentic) according to Ahmad ShakirAbu Bakr does for Muhammad what the Muslim scripture commands Muhammadans do for Allah, namely, devote their entire lives and wealth for their idol:Say: Lo! my worship and my sacrifice and my living and my dying are for Allah, Lord of the Worlds. S. 6:162 PickthallIn case the readers are unaware who Abu Bakr was, he is the one who gave his 6 or 7-year-old daughter Aisha to a 51-year-old Muhammad, who then physically consummated the marriage three years later when the minor had just turned 9!Aisha said: The Apostle of Allah married me when I was seven years old. The narrator Sulaiman said: Or six years.He had intercourse with mewhen I was nine years old.Grade: Sahih(Al-Albani) (Sunan Abu Dawud, Book 11, Number 2116https://sunnah.com/abudawud:2121)26 The Book of Marriage(29) Chapter: A Man Marrying Off HIS YOUNG DAUGHTERIt was narrated that ‘Aishah said: “The Messenger of Allah married me when I was seven years old, and he consummated the marriage with me when I was nine.”Grade: SAHIH(Darussalam)Reference: Sunan an-Nasa’i 3256In-book reference: Book 26, Hadith 61English translation: Vol. 4, Book 26, Hadith 3258 (sunnah.comhttps://sunnah.com/nasai:3256; capital emphasis mine)Hence, not only did Abu Bakr give his premature, prepubescent child to a 54-year-old man to sexually ravish, someone old enough to be Aisha’s grandfather, during a time when the premature girl was still playing on swings and with her dolls,Narrated Aisha:The Prophet engaged me when I was a girl of six (years). We went to Medina and stayed at the home of Bani-al-Harith bin Khazraj. Then I got ill and my hair fell down. Later on my hair grew (again) and my mother, Um Ruman, came to mewhile I was playing in a swing with some of my girl friends. She called me, and I went to her, not knowing what she wanted to do to me. She caught me by the hand and made me stand at the door of the house. I was breathless then, and when my breathing became all right, she took some water and rubbed my face and head with it. Then she took me into the house. There in the house I saw some Ansari women who said, “Best wishes and Allah’s Blessing and a good luck.” Then she entrusted me to them and they prepared me (for the marriage). Unexpectedly Allah’s Apostle came to me in the forenoon and my mother handed me over to him,and at that time I was a girl of nine years of age. (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Volume 5, Book 58, Number 234https://www.searchtruth.com/book_display.php?book=58&translator=1&start=0&number=234)‘A’isha reported that Allah’s Apostle married her when she was seven years old, and he was taken to his house as a bridewhen she was nine, and her dolls were with her; and when he (the Holy Prophet) diedshe was eighteen years old. (Sahih Muslim, Book 008, Number 3311https://www.searchtruth.com/book_display.php?book=008&translator=2&start=0&number=3311)He also sacrificed his whole life and wealth for this same man.In other words, Abu Bakr gave Muhammad the exact same service and devotion which the Quran exhorts Muslims to render unto Allah.Putting it simply, Abu Bakr took Muhammad as a god to be worshiped alongside Allah, with the express approval of the Islamic deity and his so-called messenger!",

S. 6:162 Hilali-KhanMarch forth, whether you are light (being healthy, young and wealthy) or heavy (being ill, old and poor),strive hard with your wealth and your lives in the Cause of Allah. This is better for you, if you but knew. S. 9:41 Hilali-KhanAnd who does more wrong than the one who invents a lie against Allah, while he is being invited to Islam? And Allah guides not the people who areZalimun(polytheists, wrong-doers and disbelievers) folk. They intend to put out the Light of Allah (i.e. the religion of Islam, this Qur’an, and Prophet Muhammad) with their mouths. But Allah will complete His Light even though the disbelievers hate (it). He it is Who has sent His Messenger (Muhammad) with guidance and the religion of truth (Islamic Monotheism) to make it victorious over all (other) religions even though theMushrikun(polytheists, pagans, idolaters, and disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah and in His Messenger Muhammed) hate (it). O You who believe! Shall I guide you to a commerce that will save you from a painful torment. That you believe in Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad),and that you strive hard and fight in the Cause of Allah with your wealth and your lives, that will be better for you, if you but know! (If you do so) He will forgive you your sins, and admit you into Gardens under which rivers flow, and pleasant dwelling in Gardens of‘AdnEternity [‘Adn(Edn) Paradise], that is indeed the great success. And also (He will give you) another (blessing) which you love, help from Allah (against your enemies) and a near victory. And give glad tidings (O Muhammad) to the believers. S. 61:7-11 Hilali-KhanAnd yet according to the hadiths, Muhammad’s best friend and father-in-law, the very man who married off his 9 year old premature, prepubescent manner to his 54 year old prophet,‘A’isha reported:Allah’s Messenger married me when I was six years old,and I was admitted to his house at the age of nine. She further said: We went to Medina and I had an attack of fever for a month, and my hair had come down to the earlobes. Umm Ruman (my mother) came to meand I was at that time on a swing along with my playmates. She called me loudly and I went to her and I did not know what she had wanted of me. She took hold of my hand and took me to the door,and I was saying: Ha, ha (as if I was gasping), until the agitation of my heart was over. She took me to a house, where had gathered the women of the Ansar. They all blessed me and wished me good luck and said: May you have share in good. She (my mother) entrusted me to them. They washed my head and embellished me and nothing frightened me. Allah’s Messenger came there in the morning,and I was entrusted to him. (Sahih Muslim,Book 008, Number 3309https://www.searchtruth.com/book_display.php?book=008&number=3309&start=0&translator=2)‘A’isha reported that Allah’s Apostle married her when she was seven years old,and she was taken to his house as a bride when she was nine, and her dolls were with her; and when he (the Holy Prophet) diedshe was eighteen years old. (Sahih Muslim, Book 008, Number 3311)Aisha said: The Apostle of Allah married me when I was seven years old. The narrator Sulaiman said: Or six years.He had intercourse with me when I was nine years old. (Sunan Abu Dawud, Book 11, Number 2116https://sunnah.com/abudawud/12/76)Yunus b. Bukayr stated, from Hisham b. ‘Urwa, from his father who said, “The Messenger of God married ‘A’isha three years after (the death of) Khadija. At that time (of the contract) ‘A’isha had been a girl of six. When he married her she was nine. The Messenger of God died when ‘A’isha was a girl of eighteen.”This tradition is consideredgharib(unique in this line).Al-Bukhari had related, from ‘Ubayd b. Isma‘il, from Abu Usama, from Hisham b. ‘Urwa, from his father, who said, “Khadija died three years before the emigration of the Prophet. He allowed a couple of years or so to pass after that, and then he contracted marriage with ‘A’isha when she was six, thereafter consummating marriage with her when she was nine years old.”What ‘Urwah stated here ismursal, incomplete, as we mentioned above, but in its content it must be judged asmuttasil, uninterrupted.His statement, “He contracted marriage with ‘A’isha when she was six, thereafter consummating marriage with her when she was nine”IS NOT DISPUTED BY ANYONE, and is well established in thesahihcollections of traditions and elsewhere.

And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” Say (O Muhammad): “Obey Allah and the Messenger (Muhammad).” But if they turn away,then Allah does not like the disbelievers.

And Allah guides not the people who areAl-Fasiqun(the rebellious, disobedient to Allah).

Again the high priest asked Him, saying to Him, ‘Are You the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?’ Jesus said, ‘I am. And you will see the Son of Mansitting at the right hand of the Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.’” Mark 14:61-62“Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him, knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead,dies no more. Death no longer has dominion over Him. For the death that He died, He died to sin once for all;but the life that He lives, He lives to God.” Romans 6:8-10“What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things? Who shall bring a charge against God’s elect? It is God who justifies. Who is he who condemns? It is Christ who died, and furthermore is also risen,who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us.” Romans 8:31-34“Seeing then that we have a great High Priestwho has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession. For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was in all points tempted as we are,yet without sin. Let us therefore comeboldlyto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.” Hebrews 4:14-16“This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which enters the Presence behind the veil, where the forerunnerhas entered for us, even Jesus, having become High Priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.” Hebrews 6:19-20“who has come, not according to the law of a fleshly commandment,but according to the power of an endless life… But He,because He continues forever, has an unchangeable priesthood.Therefore He is also able to save to the uttermostthose who come to God through Him,since He always lives to make intercession for them. For such a High Priest was fitting for us,who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and has become higher than the heavens;” Hebrews 7:16, 24-26“Now this is the main point of the things we are saying: We have such a High Priest,who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens, a Minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle which the Lord erected,and not man.” Hebrews 8:1-2“Not with the blood of goats and calves, but with His own bloodHe entered the Most Holy Place once for all, having obtained eternal redemption… Therefore it was necessary that the copies of the things in the heavens should be purified with these, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. For Christ has not entered the holy places made with hands, which are copies of the true,but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us; not that He should offer Himself often, as the high priest enters the Most Holy Place every year with blood of another—He then would have had to suffer often since the foundation of the world; but now, once at the end of the ages,He has appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself. And as it is appointed for men to die once, but after this the judgment, so Christ was offered once to bear the sins of many. To those who eagerly wait for Him He will appear a second time, apart from sin, for salvation.” Hebrews 9:12, 23-28“But this Man, after He had offered one sacrifice for sins forever,sat down at the right hand of God, from that time waiting till His enemies are made His footstool.For by one offering He has perfected foreverthose who are being sanctified.” Hebrews 10:12-14“looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame,and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.” Hebrews 12:2“But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God,the heavenly Jerusalem, to an innumerable company of angels, to the general assembly and church of the firstborn who are registeredin heaven, to God the Judge of all, to the spirits of just men made perfect,to Jesus the Mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling that speaks better things than that of Abel. Hebrews 12:22-24“To him who overcomes I will grant to sit with Me on My throne, as I also overcameand sat down with My Father on His throne.” Revelation 3:21“Now a great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a garland of twelve stars. Thenbeing with child, she cried out in labor and in pain to give birth… His tail drew a third of the stars of heaven and threw them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was ready to give birth, to devourher Childas soon as it was born. She borea male Child who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron. And her Child was caught up to God and His throne… Then I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, “Now salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of His Christ have come, for the accuser of our brethren, who accused them before our God day and night, has been cast down.’” Revelation 12:1-2, 4-5, 10Here’s where we see Satan working in and through Muhammad.Sunni Islam has taken these unique roles of Christ and attributed them to the Muslim “prophet.” This was obviously done for the purpose of steering Muslims away from the real Jesus by having them place their trust and hope in Allah’s “messenger.”According to specific Islamic narrations Allah will actually seat Muhammad on his own throne on the day of judgment and permit him to intercede for Muslims:“Even though the traditions we have mentioned on the authority of the Prophet and his Companions and the Followers indicate the correct interpretation ofmaqaman mahmudanin Qur. 17:79 (as referringto Muhammad’s role as intercessor on the Day of Resurrection),Mujahid’s statement that God will seat Muhammad on His Throne remains one whose soundness CANNOT BE REJECTED either on the basis of traditions (khabar) or on the basis of speculation (nazar). This is so because there is no tradition from the Messenger of God or anyone of his Companions or the Followers that declares it to be impossible…From what we have said, it has become clear that, it is not impossible for an adherent of Islam to say what Mujahid had said, namely, that God will seat Muhammad on His Throne. If someone says: We do not disapprove of God’s seating Muhammad on His Throne (in view of the following tradition transmitted by) ‘Abbas b. ‘Abd al-‘Azim–Yahya b. Kathir–al-Jurayri –Sayf al-Sadusi –‘Abdallah b. Salam: ‘On the Day of Resurrection, Muhammad will be on the Lord’s footstool (kursi),’ but we disapprove of God’s seating himtogether with Him, it should be said: Is it then permissible in your opinion that He seat him on it but not together with him? If he permits this, he is led to affirming that either he is together with Him, or God seats him (on the Throne) while being Himself either separate from it or neither contiguous with nor separate from it. Whatever alternative he chooses, he thereby enters into something that he disapproves. If he says that it is not permissible, he deviates from the statements of all the groups we have reported. This means diverging from the views of all adherents of Islam, since there is no other possible statement than those three,according to each of which Mujahid’s statement in this sense is not impossible.” (The History of Al-Tabari – General Introduction and From Creation to the Flood, translated by Franz Rosenthal [State University of New York Press (SUNY), Albany, NY 1989], Volume I, Appendix A: A Partial Translation of Tafsir on Qur. 17:79 (Above, pp. 75 f.), pp. 149, 151; bold and capital emphasis mine)Tabari wasn’t the only reputable scholar to narrate and/or comment this tradition:10. Al-Qurtubi’s CommentaryImam al-Qurtubi commented thus on the verse of the Exalted Station in hisTafsir:The third explanation of this verse is what al-Tabari reported from a party of scholars – among them Mujahid – whereby “the Exalted Station is the seating by Allah of the Prophet with Him on His Throne(kursiyyih).” They narrated a hadith to that effect, and al-Tabari backed up the possibility(jawâz)of such a thing with some extravagant statements(shatatin min al-qawl). However, what he said cannot be inferred [from the verse] except with over-subtlety as to meaning(al-talattuf bi al-ma‘nâ), and it is far-fetched(fîhi bu‘d).This is not to say that there is no such narration; only that [one endowed with] knowledge interprets it figuratively(al-‘ilmu yata’awwaluhu).Abu Sa‘id al-Naqqash[68]mentioned from Abu Dawud al-Sijistani:[69]“Whoever denies this hadith, WE STRONGLY CONDEMN HIM. The scholars of knowledge never stopped narrating this hadith. Who among them ever denied its possibility, even as he interpreted it?” (G. F. Haddad, The Prophet’s Seating on the Throne (Iq‘âd al-Nabî ‘alâ al-‘Arsh);https://sunnah.org/2008/07/18/the-prophets-s-seating-on-the-throne-2/; bold and capital emphasis mine)[67]Here al-Qurtubi proceeds to interpret as he had alluded that it should be done when he said: “This is not to say that there is no such narration; only that knowledge demands that it be interpreted figuratively.” (Ibid., bold emphasis mine)And:13.  Al-Barbahari’sIdée FixeIbn Abi Ya‘la relates in hisTabaqatthat the Hanbali shaykh Abu Muhammad al-Barbahari never sat to teachexcept he mentioned that the Prophet sits next to Allah on the Throne.[114][114]Ibn Abi Ya‘la,Tabaqat al-Hanabila(2:43).14.  Al-Najjad’s Attack on “Anyone That Contradicts Us”Ibn Abi Ya‘la wrote the following in his chapter on Abu Bakr al-Najjad inTabaqat al-Hanabila:‘Ali[115]narrated to me from Ibn Batta: Abu Bakr al-Najjad told us: Harun ibn al-‘Abbas[116]told us: Muhammad ibn Bishr[117]told us: ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn Sharik[118]told us: My father[119]told me: Abu Yahya al-Qattat[120]told us, From Mujahid:– Also –(2)Mu‘adh ibn al-Muthanna[121]told us: Khallad ibn Aslam[122]said: Muhammad ibn Fadl[123]told us, From Layth, From Mujahid:Concerning the verse: “It may be that thy Lord will raise you to an Exalted Station”: “He will seat him with Him on the Throne”(yujlisuhu ma‘ahu ‘alâ al-‘arsh).[124]Al-Najjad said: “I also asked [about it] Abu Yahya al-Naqid,[125]Ya‘qub al-Mutawwa‘i,[126]‘Abd Allah ibn Ahmad ibn Hanbal, and a group of our shaykhs, and they narrated to me the hadith of Muham­mad ibn Fudayl from Layth from Mujahid.“I also asked Abu al-Hasan al-‘Attar[127]about it, and he narrated to me the hadith of Mujahid. Then he said: ‘I heard Muhammad ibn Mus‘ab al-‘Abid say: “[The Prophet’s seating on the Throne will take place] in order for all creation to see his station before his Lord, and his Lord’s generosity towards him. Then the Prophet shall retire to his apartments and gardens and wives, and alone shall remain Allah in His Lordship(yanfaridu ‘azza wa jalla bi rubûbiyyatihi).”’“I also looked into the book of Ahmad ibn al-Hajjaj al-Marwazi, who is our imam and guide and proof in this. In that book I found what he mentioned concerning the rejection of the hadiths of ‘Abd Allah ibn Salam[128]and Mujahid,and he listed the names of the shaykhs WHO CRITICIZED THOSE WHO REJECTED THESE HADITHS OR OBJECTED TO THEM.“Therefore, what we declare and believe before Allah Almighty is what we have just described and made clear concerning the meanings of the hadithsquoted from the Prophet WITH AN UNINTERRUPTED CHAIN(al-ahadith al-musnada ‘an rasul Allah),—[129]and what was said by ‘Abd Allah ibn ‘Abbas—[130]and the scholars after him, which was handed down from elder to elder and from age to age until our shaykhs’ time concerning the saying of Allah: [It may be that your Lord will raise you to an Exalted Station]: the Exalted Station consists IN THE SEATING OF THE PROPHET WITH HIS LORD ON THE THRONE. WHOEVER DENIES THIS OR CONTRADICTS IT IS ONLY ATTEMPTING TO PROMOTE THE SAYINGS OF THE JAHMIS. HE SHOULD BE AVOIDED, EXPOSED, AND WARNED AGAINST.[131]“Similarly, I was told by Abu Bakr the writer,[132]from Abu Dawud al-Sijistani, that the latter said: ‘Whoever rejects the hadith of Mujahid is a Jahmi.’[133]“Furthermore, Muhammad ibn Suhayb[134]and a group of our shaykhs narrated to us from Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Malik al-Daqiqi[135]that he said: ‘I first heard this hadith fifty years ago,AND I NEVER HEARD ANYONE DENY IT. ONLY THE JAHMI HERETICS REJECT IT.’“Abu Isma‘il al-Sulami[136]mentioned to us the case of al-Tirmidhi who rejected the pre-eminence of the Prophet and belittled him.[137]Of such a man he said: ‘He does not believe in the Day of Judgment.’ I have seen our shaykhs among the friends of Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Hanbal give the same verdict.They condemned whoever rejected such pre-eminence. Allah has made this condemnation clear in the words of the scholars as far back as one can see. The people have all met this with approval, and no-one denies this nor disputes it.“Such is also my position. And should one swear a triple divorceby the seating by Allah of the Prophet on the Throne with Him, then consult me on the validity of his oath, I would say: Your words are true, your oath binding, and the divorce stands.“That is our doctrine, our religion, our belief upon which we were raised and upon which we shall die if Allah wills. We categorically condemn whoever rejects this pre-eminence to which the scholars referred and which they met with acceptance. Whoever rejects it is from the sects that are bound for destruction.”[138][131]Here al-Najjad moves from an apologetic and descriptive stance concerned primar­ily with the evidence at hand to an aggressive stance aiming at the persons of those who question it. Towards the end of the passage he once more modifies his attack so as to represent any disputation of Mujahid’s narration as an attack on the Prophet himself.[138]Abu Bakr al-Najjad in Ibn Abi Ya‘la’sTabaqat al-Hanabila(2:9-12). (Haddad; bold and capital emphasis mine)Specific Muslim scholars even went as far as to condemn those that would deny Muhammad’s enthronement as heretics who must be avoided, exposed and warned against:15. Ibn Batta’s DoctrineIbn Batta stated in his bookal-Sharh wa al-Ibana ‘ala Usul al-Sunna wa al-Diyana(“Elaboration of the Principles of Sunni Doctrine”):The Prophet shall be seated on the Throne with his Lord(yujlas ma‘a rabbihi ‘alâ al-‘arsh), and this privilege belongs to no-one else. Thus did Nafi‘ narrate it from Ibn ‘Umarfrom the Prophet concerning the verse: “It may be that thy Lord will raise you to an Exalted Station” – he said that He shall seat him with Him on the Throne. Thus also did Mujahid explain it, as narrated by Muhammad ibn Fudayl, from al-Layth, from Mujahid. (Ibid.; bold emphasis mine)Even the renowned scholar Ibn Taymiyyah and his star pupil Ibn Qayyim believed and embraced the veracity of this tradition!12. Ibn al-Qayyim’s List of SupportersIbn Qayyim al-Jawziyya[78]said in hisBada’i‘ al-Fawa’id:Al-Qadi [Ibn Abi Ya‘la][79]said: “Al-Marwazi[80]compiled a book on the superlative merits of the Prophet in which he mentioned his seating(iq‘âduhu)on the Throne(al-‘arsh).”Al-Qadi further said: “This is the position of Abu Dawud, Ahmad ibn Asram,[81]Yahya ibn Abi Talib,[82]Abu Bakr ibn Hammad,[83]Abu Ja‘far al-Dimashqi,[84]‘Abbas al-Duri,[85]Ishaq ibn Rahuyah (or Rahawayh),[86]‘Abd al-Wahhab al-Warraq,[87]Ibrahim al-Asbahani,[88]Ibrahim al-Harbi,[89]Harun ibn Ma‘ruf,[90]Muhammad ibn Isma‘il al-Sulami,[91]Muhammad ibn Mus‘ab al-‘Abid,[92]Abu Bakr ibn Sadaqa,[93]Muhammad ibn Bishr ibn Sharik,[94]Abu Qilaba,[95]‘Ali ibn Sahl,[96]Abu ‘Abd Allah ibn ‘Abd al-Nur,[97]Abu ‘Ubayd,[98]al-Husayn ibn Fadl,[99]Harun ibn al-‘Abbas al-Hashimi,[100]Isma‘il ibn Ibrahim al-Hashimi,[101]Muham­mad ibn ‘Imran al-Farisi al-Zahid,[102]Muhammad ibn Yunus al-Basri,[103]‘Abd Allah ibn Ahmad ibn Hanbal,[104]al-Marwazi, and Bishr al-Hafi.”[105]I say: It is also the position of Ibn Jarir al-Tabari,[106]and the leader of all the above in this is Mujahid, the imam of Qur’anic commentary. It is also Abu al-Hasan al-Daraqutni’s[107]who said:The hadith of Intercession narrated by AhmadIs traced back to the Elect, Ahmad.Also known to us is the hadith of his seatingOn the Throne,THEREFORE DO NOT DENY IT.Let the hadith pass exactly as narrated,And do not enter into false notions.Neither deny that the Prophet sits on the Throne,Nor deny that Allah makes him sit there![108][108]Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya,Bada’i‘ al-Fawa’id(1900 ed. 4:39-40, 1994 ed. 2:328-329). (Ibid.; bold and capital emphasis mine)And:16.  Ibn Taymiyya’s InheritanceIbn Taymiyya wrote:The scholars recognized by Allah and His accepted Friends have narrated that Muhammad the Messenger of Allahwill be seated by His Lord on the Throne next to Him.Muhammad ibn Fudayl narrated this from Layth from Mujahid in the commentary of the verse: “It may be that your Lord will raise you to an Exalted Station.” This was also mentioned through other chains, some traced back to the Prophet and some not.Ibn Jarir [al-Tabari] said: “This does not contradict the nearly-mass-narrated narrations(ma istafâdat bihi al-ahâdith)whereby the Exalted Station is the Intercession as agreed upon by the Imams of all Muslims.”He does not say that the Prophet’s seating on the Throne is denounced as false; ONLY SOME JAHMIS HELD IT SO. Nor is it objectionable to mention it in the context of a commentary on the verse.[141][141]Ibn Taymiyya,Majmu‘ al-Fatawa(Mufassal al-I‘tiqad– “Specifics of Belief” – 4:374). (Ibid.; bold and capital emphasis mine)In case Muhammadans argue that this narration is weak orda’eefhere is a report which is deemed to be reliable or sound:8. Another Narration From ‘Abd Allah ibn SalamFrom ‘Abd Allah ibn Salam, in a long hadith on the Day of Judgment: “A seat(kursî)will be placed for the Prophet on the right of Allah.”[38][38]Al-Hakim narrated it in hisMustadrak(4:568-569)and declared its chain sound(sahîh), as confirmed by al-Dhahabi. (Ibid.; bold and capital emphasis mine)Islamic scholar Livnat Holtzman mentions the controversy this hadith of Muhajid’s caused for the Muslim community:… According to Q. 17:79, God promised Muhammad ‘an honourable station’ (maqāman mahmūdan). Mujahid explained this phrase: ‘[God] will make [Muhammad] sit down with Him on His throne’.9Previous scholarship that discussed thishadīthfocused on its authenticity and its connection to the hardships that the illustrious historian and Quran exegete, Abu Jaʿfar Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari (d. 923), suffered from the Hanbalites of Baghdad.10…When Abu Bakr al-Najjad completed his thorough investigations about thishadīth, he issued a creed (ʿaqīda pl.ʿaqāʾid), a profession of faith which reflected the feelings of the Hanbalites on this matter:This is our profession of faith before God: We believe in the content of theahādīththat are attributed to the Messenger of God, but also to ʿAbd Allah ibn ʿAbbas (d. 687–8), and the scholars who succeeded him. Theseahādīthwere transmitted from one great scholar to another, from one generation to the next generation, until the times of our great teachers. We wrote theseahādīth, and meticulously investigated their content. Theseahādīthinterpret the meaning of the Quranic verse [Q. 17:79] ‘your Lord may exalt you to an honourable station’.According to theseahādīth, ‘the honourable station’ means that Muhammad will sit with His Lord on His throne. Whoever rejects this interpretation and refutes it, expresses the views of the Jahmiyya (the Muʿtazilites). One must avoid this person, turn away from him, and beware of him. Abu Bakr al-Khatib (d. 933) informed me that Abu Dawud al-Sijistani told him: ‘Whoever rejects thehadīthattributed to Mujahid is a Jahmite (Muʿtazilite)’.11Al-Najjad concluded that the belief in Muhammad’s noble virtue (fadīla) of sitting with God on the throne was one of the cornerstones of the Hanbalite creed. To illustrate the strength of this belief, al-Najjad explained that hypothetically, a man who declared that God would make Muhammad sit down with Him on the throne and thereafter took the oath on pain of triple divorce12to strengthen his declaration, should have never feared that he needed to divorce his wife. If this man came to al-Najjad to seek his legal advice whether he should divorce his wife or not, the scholar would tell him:You declared the truth, your oath is valid, and your wife should remain safely in her position. Because this is our way, our religion, and our creed. This is the root of our conviction from which we emerged. We will adhere to this conviction until the day we die.13Written in the middle of the tenth century, al-Najjad’s creed paraphrased thehadīthon Mujahid’s interpretation of ‘an honourable station’and elevated it to the degree of an article of faith for the Hanbalites. By doing so, al-Najjad sealed the turbulent history of thishadīthand silenced all the voices that spoke against thishadīthor merely doubted its veracity. Al-Najjad’s creed concluded the continuous controversy about thishadīthwith a smashing victory over the middle-of-the-road traditionalists.14To correctly evaluate al-Najjad’s creed, we need to examine the meaning of thishadīthand its history.Thehadīthon Mujahid’s interpretation of ‘an honourable station’ was one of the conspicuousahādīth al-sifāt, the traditions on the divine attributes that included anthropomorphic descriptions of God. Thishadīthwas controversial in spite of the fact that it did not describe God in any physical way or form.When read literally, thishadīthimplies that ‘an honourable station’ is an actual, physical place, and that God’s sitting on the throne (with Muhammad next to Him) is accordingly an actual sitting of a physical body. This reading obviously led totashbīh, namely comparing God to His creation and anthropomorphising Him. Laymen who heard thishadīthmight have been led to visualise a majestic human figure on a throne, sitting next to a much smaller human figure. The implied description of God in thishadīthwas unmistakably an anthropomorphic description… (Holtzman,Anthropomorphism in Islam: The Challenge of Traditionalism (700-1350) (Edinburgh Studies in Classical Islamic History and Culture)[Edinburg University Press, Ltd. 2019], Introduction, 1. The Narrator and Narrative: A Literary Analysis ofAhadith al-Sifat, pp. 4-5; bold emphasis mine)The ninth-century ultra-traditionalists who defended thishadīthand studied it,toiled a great deal to prove the antiquity of the text. Thus, a marginalmuhaddithby the name of Muhammad ibn ʿAbd al-Malik al-Daqiqi (d. 876) declared: ‘I heard thishadīthfor the last fifty years, and I never heard anyone rejecting it. Only the heretics and the Jahmites deny its veracity.’23The traditionalists also decorated thehadīthwith further details during their study sessions. The Hanbalite Abu ’l-Hasan ibn al-ʿAttar (d. 881) reminisced about such a study session, conducted by themuhaddithMuhammad ibn Musʿab al-ʿAbid al-Daʿʿaʾ (d. 843) from Baghdad:Once I heard Muhammad ibn Musʿab al-ʿAbid recount thishadīthwhich is attributed to Mujahid,namely ‘[God] will make [Muhammad] sit down with Him on His throne’. After transmitting thishadīth, Muhammad ibn Musʿab al-ʿAbid added: ‘So all the creatures will see Muhammad’s position at His Lord, and the respect that His Lord has for him. Thereafter, Muhammad will retire to his chambers, gardens and wives in Paradise, so God will remain alone in His ruling of the world.’24(Ibid., pp. 7-8; bold emphasis mine)Holtzman further notes how Muslims resorted to violence over this hadith, with some Hanbalites physically attacking the great Muslim exegete and historian al-Tabari for daring to question its veracity:The Hanbalite scholarship in defence of the anthropomorphic version included enthusiastic declarations supporting thishadīthand crowning it as authentic and valuable. Some Hanbalites went further and declared that thishadīthreflected the absolute truth, and should it be refuted, they would immediately divorce their wives.40The more reserved Hanbalites searched for Ahmad ibn Hanbal’s opinion on thishadīth. We found evidence of his supposed opinion inIbtāl al-Taʾwīlāt, a thematic Hadith compilation authored by the Hanbalite theologian and qadi Abu Yaʿla ibn al-Farraʾ (d. 1066; he was also the father of the biographer Ibn Abi Yaʿla). Abu Yaʿla dedicated a lengthy chapter in his book to the efforts of the Hanbalitemuhaddithūnto validate thehadīthattributed to Mujahid.Thus, the Hanbalites claimed that Ahmad ibn Hanbal himself ordered his disciples to transmit the anthropomorphic version attributed to Mujahid in the exact wording as it was received. The Hanbalites further claimed that Ahmad ibn Hanbal believed that the anthropomorphicversion should have been attributed to Mujahid’s teacher, thesahābīIbnʿAbbas.41These two claims do not correspond with the fact that thehadīthattributed to Mujahid was not included in theMusnadof Ahmad ibn Hanbal, the canonical Hadith compilation of the Hanbalites. Furthermore, Ahmad ibn Hanbal is not mentioned in the list of some thirty early Hanbalite scholars who professed their support for the anthropomorphic version attributed to Mujahid. These names were assembled by Abu Bakr al-Marwazi himself.42It is reasonable to assume that if al-Marawzi thought that Ahmad ibn Hanbal had supported thishadīth, or merely acknowledged its existence, he would have mentioned Ahmad ibn Hanbal at the top of the list.43The debate about the anthropomorphic version did not remain a theoretical issue. Thehadīthbecame a major component in the political agenda of the Hanbalites. In the year 922 (this is an approximate chronology, as the historical sources do not provide specific details about the following occurrence),a group of Hanbalites attacked the illustrious historian and Quran exegete Abu Jaʿfar Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari (d. 923) in Baghdad. Al-Tabari, as one of the sources claimed,refused to accept the anthropomorphic version attributed to Mujahid and had the audacity to reject thishadīthin public.44In his great exegesis of the Quran, al-Tabari implanted subtle references to his rejection of thehadīthattributed to Mujahid: he first established that ‘the majority of the scholars’ (akthar ahl al-ʿilm) believed that the ‘honourable station’ was Muhammad’s intercession for the people on the Day of Resurrection,45by quoting a dozenahādīthto prove his point.46In the next phase, al-Tabari remarked that ‘others’ (ākharūn) claimed that the ‘honourable station’ meant that God promised the Prophet that He would make the Prophet sit on the throne, next to God.47Thereafter, al-Tabari quoted ten anthropomorphic variants of thehadīthattributed to Mujahid.48As a rule, al-Tabari did not hesitate throughout his work of exegesis to accept certainahādīthas authentic and reject others. Nonetheless, he was extremely cautious in the case of thehadīthattributed to Mujahid: Al-Tabari declared that there is no way to refute the authenticity of thehadīthattributed to Mujahid, neither by locating some textual evidence (khabar) nor by applying rational reasoning (nazar).49This saying is far from the enthusiastic declarations of the Hanbalites support for thishadīth’s veracity. We note that the Hanbalites declared that the sceptics who did not accept thishadīthwere heretics. However, in the severe circumstances in which al-Tabari lived in Baghdad (he was forced to stay at home, while visitors were prevented from visiting him),50al-Tabari seemed to have no other choice but to issue his lukewarm support of thishadīth’s authenticity.In 929, strife arose between the Hanbalite supporters of Abu Bakr al-Marwazi and ‘a group of commoners’ (tāʾifa min ’l-ʿāmma) in Baghdad. This strife,which soon escalated into riots (fitna)was ignited because of an argument about Q. 17:79, and ‘an honourable station’. Relying on earlier sources,the Damascene historian Ibn Kathir (d. 1373) reported on these riotsin his monumental chronicleal-Bidāya wa’l-Nihāya. Ibn Kathir’s report is quite odd, because in it the ‘commoners’ claimed that ‘an honourable station’ was ‘the great intercession’,while the Hanbalites held their traditional position about Muhammad’s sitting on the throne. According to Ibn Kathir,the riots resulted in the deaths of an unspecified number of rioters. Ibn Kathir adds his opinion that according toSahīh al-Bukhāri, the canonical Hadith compilation, ‘an honourable station’ was indeed the great intercession.51It seems that by determining that there was only one possible interpretation of ‘an honourable station’, and that this interpretation was not the one favoured by the Hanbalites, Ibn Kathir (who was considered an indirect disciple of the Hanbalite Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya) expressed his reservation about the behaviour of the tenth-century Hanbalites and their choice of texts to venerate. Other authors of the Mamluk period,like the Shafiʿite Ibn Hajar al-ʿAsqalani (d. 1449), who in fact was inclined towards Ashʿarite theology,accepted thehadīthattributed to Mujahid.52Ibn Hajar even harshly condemned a later rationalistic scholar who refuted this hadīth.53The admission of the anthropomorphic version to the traditionalistic canon was therefore fully accomplished in the fifteenth century.

Ignaz Goldziher was the first scholar to address thishadīthand its consequences in both the public sphere (the 929 riots, al-Tabari’s ordeals, etc.), and the role that Mujahid played in shaping thishadīth: Goldziher,Die Richtungen der islamischen Koranauslesung, pp. 101–11. Franz Rosenthal’s informative introduction to his translation of al-Tabari’sKitāb al-Rusul wa’l-Mulūkfocuses on al-Tabari’s interpretation of Q. 17:79, and provides an interpretation of al-Tabari’s discussion on thehadīthattributed to Mujahid: Rosenthal, ‘General Introduction’, pp. 57–8, 69–78. Another illuminating discussion on al-Tabari’s interpretation of Q. 17:79 is Claude Gilliot’s. Gilliot also analyses a parallel passage authored by the Quran exegete Abu ʿAbd Allah al-Qurtubi (d. 1272): Gilliot,Exégèse, langue, et théologie, pp. 249–54. Two indispensable discussions are Swartz,A Medieval Critique of Anthropomorphism, p. 249, footnote 358; and Ramadān,Usūl al-Dīnʿinda ’l-Imām al-Tabarī, pp. 23–33. The confrontations between the Hanbalites and al-Tabari are briefly described in Turner, Inquisition in Early Islam, pp. 145–8. Turner determines that ‘[t]he violent Hanbalī response to al-Tabarī is most clearly understood if theirmadhhabis seen as a new player competing with al-Tabarī’smadhhab, which was equally new’: Turner,Inquisition in Early Islam, p. 146.

(Ibid., pp. 17-20; bold emphasis mine)Hence, Muhammad will be given a seat at the right side of Allah!Since the throne represents Allah’s lordship over creation (rububiyyah),Verily your Lord is Allah, who created the heavens and the earth in six days,and is firmly established on the throne (of authority), regulating and governing all things. No intercessor (can plead with Him) except after His leave (hath been obtained). This is Allah your Lord; Him therefore serve ye: will ye not receive admonition?

S. 25:1-2 ArberryThis means that Allah shall take Muhammad as a partner in his exclusive rule over the heavens and earth, making his so-called prophet into another sovereign lord besides himself!As if Islam’s blasphemy couldn’t get any worse, other supposedauthentic narrations assert that the names of Allah and Muhammad are written on the pillars of Allah’s throne, and that Adam was forgiven because he invoked Muhammad’s name!Al-Bayhaqi cited the following hadith in his book “Dala’il an-Nubuwwah” (Signs of Prophethood): Narrated ‘Umar Ibn al-Khattab: the Prophet said: “When Adam committed the sin, he said to Allah, ‘O My Lord,I ask You with reference to Muhammad to forgive me‘. Allah said: ‘O Adam! How did you know about Muhammad, for I have not yet created him?’ Adam replied, ‘O My Lord, when You created me,I looked up and saw inscribed on the legs of the Throne the words: There is no God worthy of worship except Allah and Muhammad is His Messenger. I knew that you do not attach to Your name but the name of the dearest of Your Creation.’ Allah said to Adam, ‘You have spoken rightly, Adam. Muhammad is the dearest of My Creation. I have forgiven youbecause you asked by Muhammad. AND HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR HIM, I WOULD NOT HAVE CREATED YOU.'” This hadith was narrated by al-Hakim who also classified it AS SAHIH (AUTHENTIC). Among the transmitters of this hadith is ‘Abd ar-Rahman Ibn Zayd Ibn Aslam. Al-Haythami said: “This hadith was reported by at-Dabarani and in its chain of transmitters are people I do not know. Al-Hakim was therefore mistaken in classifying this hadith as sahih because he himself criticised ‘Abd ar-Rahman Ibn Zayd Ibn Aslam in his bookad-Du’afa, so how can he state the authenticity of the hadith after he had criticised him?!!” (Tafsir Ibn Kathir, Part 1, Surah Al-Fatiah Surah Al-Baqarah, ayat 1 to 141, Abridged by Sheikh Nasib Ar-Rafa’i [Al-Firdous Ltd., London: Second Edition 1998], p. 107, fn 10; bold and capital emphasis mine)And:Abu Muhammad al-Makki, Abu’l-Layth as-Samarqandi and others related that when Adam rebelled, he said, “O Allah, forgive me my error BY THE RIGHT OF MUHAMMAD!” Allah said to him, “How do you know Muhammad?” He said, “I saw written in every place in the Garden, ‘There is no god but Allah, Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.’ So I knew that he was the most honoured creation in Your eyes.” SO ALLAH TURNED TO HIM AND FORGAVE HIM. It is said that this is the interpretation of the words of Allah,“Adam learned some words from his Lord.”(2:27)Another variant has that Adam said, “When you created me, I lifted my gaze to Your Throne AND WRITTEN ON IT WAS: ‘There is no god but Allah, Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah,’ so I knew there would be no one held in greater esteem by You THAN THE ONE WHOSE NAME YOU PLACED ALONGSIDE YOUR OWN NAME.” Allah then revealed to him, “By My might and majesty, he is the last of the prophets among your descendants. IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR HIM, I WOULD HAVE NOT CREATED YOU.” It is said that Adam was given thekunya, Abu Muhammad. Some people say that it was Abu’l-Bashar (the father of mankind). (Qadi ‘Iyad Musa al-Yahsubi,Muhammad Messenger of Allah (Ash-Shifa of Qadi ‘Iyad), translated by Aisha Abdarrahman Bewley [Madinah Press, Inverness, Scotland, U.K. 1991; third reprint, paperback], Chapter Three: On the Sound And Well-Known Traditions Related About the Immense Value Placed On Him By His Lord, His Exalted Position And His Nobility In This World And The Next, Section 1: His place, p. 89; capital emphasis mine)Gibril Haddad mentions similar reports:– The hadith of Adam’stawassulthrough the Prophet is related by the Companions – Maysara, Ibn ‘Abbas, and Ibn ‘Umar – with chains varying in strength from strong to very weak:I. Ibn al-Jawzi narrated inal-Wafawith his chain through al-Bayhaqi’s and al-Khatib’s shaykh, the trustworthyhafizAbu al-Husayn ‘Ali ibn Muhammad ibn ‘Abd Allah, known as Ibn Bishran al-‘Adl al-Umawi al-Baghdadi al-Mu‘addal (d. 411 or 415) in hisFawa’id, from the trustworthyhafizandMusnidof Baghdad Abu Ja‘far Muhammad ibn ‘Amr ibn al-Bakhtari al-Razzaz, from Ahmad ibn Ishaq ibn Salih al-Wazzan al-Jurjani (d. 281“la ba’sa bihi”according to al-Daraqutni), from Muhammad ibn Sinan al-‘Awqi (d. 223, al-Bukhari’s shaykh in theSahih), from Ibrahim ibn Tahmn (one of the narrators of theSahihayn), from Budayl ibn Maysara (one of the narrators inSahih Muslim), from ‘Abd Allah ibn Shaqiq (one of the narrators inSahih Muslim), from the Companion Maysarat al-Fajr:I said: “Messenger of Allah, when were you made a Prophet?” He replied: “When Allah created the earth and turned to the heavens, arranging them into seven heavens, and He created the Throne,He wrote on the leg of the Throne: MUHAMMAD IS THE MESSENGER OF ALLAH AND THE SEAL OF PROPHETS. And Allah created Paradise in which He made Adam and Hawwa’ dwell,then He wrote my name [there] on the gates, the tree-leaves, the houses and tents, while Adam was still between the spirit and the body. When Allah Most High brought him to life,he looked at the Throne and saw my name, whereupon Allah Most High informed him: ‘He is the liege-lord of your offspring.’ When shaytan deceived them, they repented and sought intercessionwith my name from Him.”The hadith master al-Salihi cited it inSubul al-Huda wal-Rashad(Beirut ed. 1:86=Cairo ed. 1:104) and said “Its chain is good and there is no harm in it.”1Al-Halabi also cited it in hisSira(1:355)…II. Al-Khallal narrated inal-Sunna(1:261): Al Fadl ibn Muslim al-Muharibi narrated to us: Muhammad ibn ‘Isma narrated to us: Jundul [ibn Waliq,thiqaper al-Haythami] narrated to us: ‘Amr ibn Aws al-Ansari [masturper al-Dhahabi] narrated to us: from Sa‘id ibn Abi ‘Aruba: from Qatada: from Sa‘id ibn al-Musayyab: from Ibn ‘Abbas: Allah Most High revealed to ‘Isa: ‘O ‘Isa, Believe in Muhammad and command whosoever reaches his time among your Community that they believe in him.Were it not for Muhammad, I would not have created Adam, and were it not for Muhammad, I would not have created Paradise or Hellfire. Indeed, I created the Throne on top of the water and it shook, so I inscribed upon it LA ILAHA ILLA ALLAH MUHAMMADAN RASULULLAH, where upon it stood still.’” Al-Khallal said: “I read it to Abu ‘Abd Allah Muhammad ibn Bishr ibn Sharik and he concurred with it,”i.e.with its being authentic.Al-Hakim similarly narrated in theMustadrak(2:614-615=2:271): ‘Ali ibn Hamshadh al-‘Adl (258-338) [Abu al-Hasan al-Naysaburi, a major trustworthyhafiz] narrated to us by dictation: Harun ibn al-‘Abbas al-Hashimi (208-275) [thiqaper al-Khatib] narrated to us: Jundul ibn Waliq narrated to us, to the end of the above chain and text. Al-Hakim said: “This is a sound-chained hadithbut Al-Bukhari and Muslim did not narrate it.”2Al-Dhahabi in hisTalkhis al-MustadrakandMizan al-I‘tidal(s.v.‘Amr ibn Aws) conjectures that Ibn ‘Abbas’s narration is forged (“azunnuhu mawdu‘an”)but brings no proof, as its chain contains neither a liar nor a forger and is a fair chain by theSalafs criteria forfada’ilhadiths.1A grading confirmed by ‘Abd Allah al-Ghumari inMurshid al-Ha’ir(p. 37) andal-Radd al-Muhkam(p. 138-139) as well as his student Mahmud Mamduh inRaf‘ al-Minara(p. 247-249).2Also Abu al-Shaykh inTabaqat al-Asfahaniyyinaccording to al-Lacknawi inal-Athar al-Marfu‘a(p. 44), and Abu Sa‘d al-Naysaburi in (1:163-165 §15). (Hadith of Adam’s tawassul through the Prophet; bold and capital emphasis mine)The foregoing makes it abundantly clear that Satan raised up Muhammad to become a Christ figure in order to mislead people from turning to the true Jesus, mankind’s only hope of salvation:“‘Let not your heart be troubled; you believe in God,believe also in Me. In My Father’s house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you.I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you,I will come again and receive you to Myself; that where I am, there you may be also. And where I go you know, and the way you know.’ Thomas said to Him, ‘Lord, we do not know where You are going, and how can we know the way?’ Jesus said to him, ‘I am the way, the truth,and the life. No one comes to the Fatherexcept through Me.’” John 14:1-6“Then Peter,filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, ‘Rulers of the people and elders of Israel: If we this day are judged for a good deed done to a helpless man, by what means he has been made well, let it be known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, by Him this man stands here before you whole. This is the “stone which was rejected by you builders, which has become the chief cornerstone.”Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.’ Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were uneducated and untrained men, they marveled.And they realized that they had been with Jesus. And seeing the man who had been healed standing with them,they could say nothing against it.” Acts 4:8-14It also proves that Islam is not a monotheistic faith since it has turned Muhammad into a demigod who shares in Allah’s exclusive traits.May the risen Lord of glory, God’s beloved Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, deliver Muslims from this antichrist figure, saving them from Allah and his so-called messenger, and bring them to his glorious feet in order to experience the everlasting love and peace that comes from him alone:All things have been delivered to Me by My Father, and no one knows the Son except the Father. Nor does anyone know the Father except the Son, and the one to whom the Son wills to reveal Him.Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.” Matthew 11:27-30“Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.” John 14:27“These things I have spoken to you,that in Me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation; but be of good cheer,I have overcome the world.” John 16:33All biblical references taken from the New King James Version (NKJV).FURTHER READINGMuhammad on the Throne – More on Islam’s Other GodQuran Difficulty: Is Allah the only ruler?APPENDIXThe belief in Muhammad’s enthronement led to strife and violence among the Muslims, which even resulted in al-Tabari being viciously opposed by a group of Hanbali Muslims. These Muslims went as far as to destroy al-Tabari’s very own home, and having him barred from speaking in certain places:Qur’an 17:79 was generally explained as eschatological274and the “praiseworthy position” as referring to Muhammad’s role as intercessor with the Deity on the Last Day. There was, however, a tradition reported from Mujahid (but not found in the preserved recension of his commentary on Qur. 17:79) which reached Tabari by way of ‘Abbad b. Ya’qub al-Asadi–Muhammad b. Fudayl–Layth b. Abi Sulaym.It states that the “praiseworthy position” means that Muhammad will be seated by God on his divine Throne.275Hanbalite championship of the tradition produced vehement outpourings of hatred against those who opposed it, allegedly with equal immoderation. They were called by every conceivable epithet; they were branded as innovators, liars, ignoramuses, heretics (zindiq), and unbelievers. Above all, they were seen as Jahmis, that is, speculative theologians (Mu’tazilites). Their nefarious intent–or, at any rate, the result of their attitude–was to deny a singular distinction to the Prophet, and, in the process, they defamed the exemplary Muslim that was Mujahid. Already Ibn Hanbal’s principal successor as spokesman for his legal school, Abu Bakr al-Marrudhi (d. 275/888),276was strongly partial to Mujahid’s tradition and appears to have employed the “praiseworthy position” question as a sort of shibboleth. Abu Bakr al-Marrudhi’s student and successor as the principal Hanbalite scholar of his time, Abu Bakr al-Khallal (d. 311/923), took up the subject. He reproduced his teacher’ s arguments at length and thus preserved them for posterity.277His younger contemporary, al-Barbahari (d. 329/941),278then made the most of it.He missed no opportunity to proclaim Qur. 17:79 as referring to the Prophet’s being seated on the divine Throne. Although al-Barbahari’s name is not mentioned in connectionwith Tabari’s Hanbalite trouble, he probably must be seen as the person behind much of it.The actual course of the events affecting Tabari can be reconstructed only with difficulty, because supporters on both sides apparently circulated conflicting reports. Matters appear to have come to a head after the year 290/903. In that year, Tabari returned to his home town in Tabaristan on a second, and apparently last, visit. He no doubt used the Khurasan Road that took him through such large cities as Dinawar and Hamadhan. In Dinawar, he stopped to meet with scholars there and to give lectures; he may very well have done the same in other towns along the road, thus making his journey profitable intellectually and, possibly, economically. On his return to Baghdad,three Hanbalites, who do not seem further identifiable,279asked Tabari about his views on Mujahid’s tradition. Tabari is said to have declared bluntly that it was absurd. Moreover, he added a flippant jingle ridiculing it:Praised be the One Who has no confidant and has no one to sit on His Throne.Enraged Hanbalites thereupon stoned his residenceand caused a serious disturbance which had to be subdued by force.Trouble with the Hanbalites that took a similar form is also reported at the time of Tabari’s death. In connection with it, Nazuk is mentioned as chief of police. He was appointed to this position only in 310/922[3], the year Tabari died, but he appears to have held high positions in the police before and may already have been in charge of Tabari ‘s protection against potential Hanbalite violence. In 309/921121, the wazir ‘Ali b. ‘Isa had offered Tabari the opportunity to debate the matter with the Hanbalites in his residence. Tabari agreed, but the Hanbalites did not show up.280However, shortly before his death, Hanbalite rioters supposedly pelted his house with stones so numerous that they formed a large wall in front of it. The verse just quoted was discovered written on the wall of Tabari’s house. After the riot subsided, someone wrote underneath it:Ahmad281will no doubt have a high position when he comes to the Merciful One,Who will draw him near and seat him nobly to spite an(y) envier,Upon a throne enveloping him282with perfume to make livid an(y) obnoxious liar.(He has) truly this unique position (al-maqam).This has been transmitted by Layth from Mujahid.Inscriptions in verse or prose on the walls of houses are a standard device of the Arabic literary imagination. It seems most unlikely that a man in Tabari’s position and at his advanced age would have beenso childish as to write inflammatory verses on the walls of his house. Someone else might have done itin order to provoke the Hanbalite mob. Presumably, however, the mural poetry was a literary embellishment invented by Hanbalites which crept into the vague reports about the event.283The fact that historiansreport another bloody incident aboutmaqaman mahmudaninvolving followers of the late Abu Bakr al-Marrudhi for the year 317/929284neither confirms nor invalidates the historicity of the event involving Tabari.The circumstances surrounding the debate about the “praiseworthy position” deserve some more clarification. In hisMusnad, Ibn Hanbal includes no traditions that supportthe interpretation of the phrase as referring to the Prophet’s being seated on the divine Throne.285One might argue that the very fact that Ibn Hanbal has nothing to say about the impossibility of Mujahid’s interpretationcould indicate that it could not be ruled out, using a type of argument employed by Tabari in his discussion of the matter. This, however, is very unlikely. Ibn Hanbal may have simply disregarded Mujahid’s tradition as irrelevant or objectionable. After all, it had noisnadgoing back to more ancient authorities or the Prophet, while there were traditions having the Prophet’s seal of approval that referred to intercession. Clearly,this made it necessary to invent an appropriate Prophetical tradition for Muhammad’s place on the divine Throne, AND THIS WAS DONE. Ibn Battah (d. 387/997) listed one such tradition with theisnadNafi’–’Abdallah b. ‘Umar–the Prophet.286He is certain not to have invented it himself. When it made its first appearance is hard to say; evidently, Abu Bakr al-Khallal in the early years of the century did not yet know it.InTafsir, Tabari has a long and interesting discussion of the “praiseworthy position.”287It again shows him to be the great compromiser. He admits that intercession is the interpretation that is solidly documented and which therefore has the best claim to being correct. However, he says, the other interpretation cannot entirely be ruled out. As the composition ofTafsirantedates the events described, it might be argued that Tabari interpolated the discussion inTafsirafter publication when Hanbalite hostility took such a truly ugly turn.288This cannot be proved. It might be assumed that he took at first a conciliatory attitude such as is displayed inTafsirand renounced it at some later date when he got disgusted with Hanbalite violence. This seems more likely, but again there is no hard evidence for it. Whatever it was, the view expressed inTafsirdid nothing to assuage Hanbalite opposition to him which appears to have had deeper roots than merely disagreement about a catchy slogan.The arguments marshalled by Tabarifor the purpose of making Mujahid’s tradition admissiblewere derived from speculative theology and show him adept in its ways of thinking and debating. The basic issue, as he sees it, is the problem of contiguity (mumassah). It had its proper place in physics but was transferred to theology by religious thinkers289Al-Ash’ari (ca 260324/873(41-935(6)), who lived most of his life in al-Basrah and was but a generation removed from Tabari, considered the matter important enough to refer to it in his discussion of anthropomorphism (tajsim).God is not upon the Throne, except in the sense that He is above it but does not touch it. According to Hisham b. al-Hakam,God’s location is in one specific place (fi makan dun makan). His place is the Throne, and He is in touch with it. The Throne encompasses and delimits Him. Another view holds that the Creator fills the Throne and is in touch with it. At this point,al-Ash’ari adds that some hadith scholars hold that the Throne is not filled by Him and that He (is thus able to) SEAT HIS PROPHET WITH HIMSELF ON THE THRONE.290Tabari considers the problem of God completely filling the Throne. He remarks on His contiguity and finds that only three possibilities apply to it. For him, however,the crucial point that must be made is that God’s seating of Muhammad on the Throne, with or without Himself, does not imply divinity (“lordship”rububiyyah) for the Prophet or deny his status as a human being (“servantship”‘ubudiyyah). In fact,the implied hint at Muhammadan divinitywould appear to be the most objectionable feature of Mujahid’s tradition. In touching upon this aspect,Tabari comes close to the possible reason why Mujahid might have made this seemingly un-Islamic statement. Christianity speaks of the Son not only as sitting on a throne but also of some mysterious being as sitting together with the Father in His Throne (Rev. 3:21). Even in remote Mecca, Mujahid could have heard about these viewsor seen one of the many representations of the Trinity or the enthroned Christ.291He may very well have felt that Muhammad should be similarly distinguished as was the prophet of Christianity. (Rosenthal,The History of Al-Tabari, Introduction, pp. 71-77)276. For Abu Bakr Ahmad b. Muhammad b. al-Haljaj al-Marrudhi, see Ibn Abi Yaia,Tabaqat, I, 56-63; Sam’ani,Ansab, XII, 201 f.; Yaqut,Mu’jam, IV, 506, s. v. Marty al-Rudh. According to Dhahabi,‘Uluww, 125, 1. 2, he wrote in defense of Mujahid’s tradition (see below, n. 277). Ibn Abi Ya’la,Tabaqat, 6o, states that al-Marrudhi was asked about the Jahmiyyah’s rejection of the “story of the Throne.” This may refer to alleged Mu’tazilah views on the location of the Throne, rather than, specifically, to the tradition of Mujahid.277. For Abu Bakr al-Khallal, see Sezgin,GAS, I, 511 f. I wish to thank J. van Ess for providing me with a xerox copy of Khallal,Musnad, 75-99.278. For al-Hasan b. ‘Ali b. Khalaf al-Barbahari, see Sezgin,GAS, 1, 512; Laoust, inMelanges Massignon, III, 22-5. Ibn Abi Ya’la,Tabaqat, II, 18-45, gives a good picture of his generally extremist positions. “Whenever al-Barbahari attended a meeting,he would mention that God seats Muhammad with Himself on the Throne.” In 323/935,he was in hiding and his followers were strictly forbidden to assemble. One of them was accusedof having set a disastrous fire in al-Karkh, see Hamadhani,Takmilah, 79 f., ed. Cairo, XI, 294-6. See further Brockelmann,GAL, Suppl. I, 344, and the indexes ofEclipseand Massignon,Passion2, as well as Allard,Attributs, 103 f.279. The three were Abu ‘Abdallah al-Jassas, Ja’far b. ‘Arafah, and al-Bayadi. The identification of al-Bayadi with Abu ‘Ali Muhammad b. ‘lsa al -Bayadi was proposed by the editor ofIrshid, VI, 436, n. 1, but requires confirmation. This individual, whose family claimed ‘Abbasid descent, wrote on Qur’an reading. He was killed by the Qarmatians in 294/906 on his return from the pilgrimage, seeTB, II, 401; Sam’ani,Ansab, 384.On the incident, see also Goldziher,Muslim Studies, II, 158 (II, 168, of the original German). Goldziher’s reference was to Suyuti,Tahdhir, 161, whose source scurrilously attributes this information to a storyteller in the streets of Baghdad. (Ibid., pp. 72-73)285. Sec Ibn Hanbal,Musnad, 1, 375 f., 398 f., III, 354, for traditions on intercession. Forthe tradition of Gabriel sitting “on a footstool” or “on the throne,” presumably the divine Throne, between heaven and earth, see Ibn Hanbal,Musnad, III, 306: Ibn Hajar,Fath, X, 305.286. See Laoust,Profession de foi d’Ibn Batta, text, 61, trans., 112 f., especially note I. In addition to Mujahid, al-Wahidi (d. 468/1075) refers to a tradition of Ibn Masud, see Razi,Tafsir, XXI, 32. He may have the same tradition in mind, mixing up, as it sometimes happens, ‘Abdallah b. Umar and ‘Abdallah b. Masud. A tradition of ‘A’ishah on the subject is discussed in Ibn al-Jawzi,Daf’, 81,hadithno. 39.287. SeeTafsir, XV, 97, 1. 10-100, 1. 22. See the translation below, Appendix A, below, pp. 149-51. For another partial translation, see Andrae,Person, 270-2. For Tabari’s real feelings about Mujahid and his tradition, it may be indicative that he rejects a view expressed by him with unusual harshness in connection with his commentary on the same verse of the Qur’an, seeTafsir, XV, 96, 11. 26-31. (Ibid., p. 75)291. Not much can be made in this connection of the allegation that Mujahid used material provided by Christians and Jews in his Qur’an commentary. See Ibn Sa’d,Tabaqat, V, 344, 1. 7, and the remark transmitted through Abu Bakr b. ‘Ayyash (below, translation, n. 72) in Dhahabi,Mizan, III, 439; Ibn Hajar,Tahdhib, X, 43; Sezgin,GAS, 1, 29. As one would expect, Dhahabi refers to Mujahid’s view ofmakaman mahmudanwith disapproval.On Mujahidand the vibrating of the divine Throne, see Goldziher,Richtungen, 108 f.A similar but different idea was already expressed in Khallil,Musnad, 82. The Muslims would be the laughing stock of Christiansif they denied to Muhammad the honor of sitting on the divine Throne, while granting semidivine status to Jesus. (Ibid., p. 277)",

    "full_content": "Why is Palestine Not Mentioned in the Qur’an?By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaFor Max Shimba Ministries OrgIntroductionA close reading of the Qur’an reveals a striking omission: the namePalestineis never mentioned. Instead, the Qur’an consistently affirms the unique and divinely chosen status of Israel and the land granted to the children of Israel. This raises a significant theological and historical question: if Allah himself never sanctified or even acknowledged “Palestine” in the Qur’an, why do contemporary Muslims advocate so strongly for Palestinian claims against Israel? This tension exposes both a religious and political paradox.The Qur’anic Recognition of IsraelInSurat al-Baqara 2:40, Allah addresses the Israelites directly:“O Children of Israel! Remember My favor which I bestowed upon you, and fulfill My covenant upon you, and I will fulfill your covenant from Me, and fear only Me.”This verse highlights that Israel—not the Arab nations—was the recipient of divine favor. The Qur’an does not record a parallel address to the Arabs, nor does it affirm that Palestine, as a geographical or theological entity, holds any divine sanctity.Israel’s Superiority According to the Qur’anAllah’s words inSurat al-Baqara 2:47emphasize Israel’s exalted status:“O Children of Israel! Remember My favor which I bestowed upon you and that I preferred you over all peoples.”Here, the Qur’an explicitly affirms that the Israelites were divinely chosen and elevated above other nations—including the Arabs. This divine election becomes a source of envy and resentment, particularly among Arabs who are excluded from this covenantal privilege.Theological Implications of the Omission of PalestineWhile the Qur’an repeatedly acknowledges Israel as a blessed nation, it is silent on the existence or significance of Palestine. There is no verse declaring Palestine as a sacred land, nor any recognition that the Arab peoples inherited the divine covenant. Consequently, the Muslim claim to Palestine rests not on scriptural authority, but on political and ideological constructs that developed much later.Israel as the Recipient of Revelation and ProphecyFurther evidence is found inSurat al-Jaathiya 45:16:“And indeed We gave the Children of Israel the Scripture and judgment and prophethood, and We provided them with good things, and We preferred them over all the worlds.”The Qur’an acknowledges that Israel was entrusted with Scripture (Kitab), divine law (hukm), and prophecy (nubuwwa). These privileges are not attributed to Arabs or Palestinians. Thus, the very text that Muslims hold as divine testimony reinforces Israel’s unique role in salvation history.Historical and Contemporary EnvyThis recognition helps explain the persistent animosity of many Arab nations toward Israel. According to the Qur’an itself, Israel is chosen and divinely favored, while the Arabs are not. Such exclusion breeds theological jealousy and political hostility, fueling centuries of conflict and attempts to delegitimize Israel’s existence.ConclusionThe Qur’an itself provides the foundation for understanding why the modern concept of “Palestine” lacks divine legitimacy. By consistently affirming Israel’s chosen status and entirely omitting Palestine, the Qur’an inadvertently supports the biblical truth that Israel is God’s covenant people. For Christians, this serves as yet another confirmation that God’s promises to Israel remain unshaken. No matter the political manipulations or hostilities, Israel continues to stand as a nation blessed by God, both biblically and—ironically—even according to the Qur’an.Author’s NoteThis reflection is presented as part of the theological mission ofMax Shimba Ministries Org, which is dedicated to proclaiming the truth of the gospel and defending the authority of Scripture against distortions.Maxwell Shimba, Th.D.Servant of Jesus ChristMax Shimba Ministries Org ©2016.

Hadithi hii inapatikana katika tafsiri ya Ibn Ishaq yaSirat Rasul Allah, ambapo Aisha anasema:\"Mtume alifia kifuani pangu wakati wa zamu yangu: Sijamkosea mtu yoyote yule kuhusiana naye. Ilikuwa ni kwa sababu ya kutokujua kwangu na udogo uliozidi kiasi hata Mtume akanifia mikononi mwangu.\"(Guillaume, A., 1955, The Life of Muhammad, Oxford University Press, Karachi, Pakistan, p. 682)Hadithi hii inatolewa kama ushahidi wa kihistoria kwamba Aisha alikuwa na umri mdogo wakati wa ndoa na kifo cha Mtume Muhammad. Hata hivyo, taarifa hizi zimekuwa msingi wa mjadala mkubwa wa kisomi, kihistoria, na kimaadili.Umri wa Aisha na Ndoa ya Mtume MuhammadTaarifa nyingi za kihistoria zinadai kuwa Aisha aliolewa akiwa na umri wa miaka sita na ndoa yao ilikamilika akiwa na miaka tisa. Hadithi hizi zinapatikana katika baadhi ya vyanzo vya msingi vya Kiislamu kama Sahih al-Bukhari na Sahih Muslim.\"Aisha alisema: Mtume alikamilisha ndoa yake nami nilipokuwa na miaka tisa.\"(Sahih al-Bukhari, Hadithi 5133; Sahih Muslim, Hadithi 1422)Hata hivyo, baadhi ya wataalamu wa kisasa wanahoji uhalali wa taarifa hizi za umri mdogo. Wana hoja kwamba rekodi hizi zinaweza kuwa zimeongezwa baadaye kwa sababu za kisiasa au za kidini, au kwa sababu za makosa ya tafsiri ya historia. Kwa mfano, Muhammad Hamidullah na Jonathan A. C. Brown wanasema kuwa muktadha wa kihistoria unaweza kuashiria kwamba Aisha alikua mkubwa zaidi kuliko ilivyoelezwa katika baadhi ya hadithi.\"The age of Aisha at marriage is widely debated. Some early sources suggest she was very young, but contextual evidence may point to a higher age at consummation.\"(Brown, J.A.C., 2009,Misquoting Muhammad, Harvard University Press)Hii inasababisha mjadala wa kihistoria na kimaadili: Je, historia hii inapaswa kutafsiriwa kisawa na kwa wingi wa vyanzo, au je, taarifa za hadithi zinasalia kuwa chanzo cha msingi cha ushahidi wa umri wa Aisha?Mchango wa Aisha katika Historia ya KiislamuHaijalishi umri wake, Aisha aliwahi kuwa mmoja wa wake wa Mtume Muhammad wenye ushawishi mkubwa. Alijulikana kwa ujuzi wake katika:Sharia (Sheria za Kiislamu)– Aisha alichangia kwa kiasi kikubwa katika tafsiri za fiqh na masuala ya kisheria.Hadithi (Ufunuo wa Mtume)– Alieleza mamia ya hadithi ambazo zimekuwa msingi wa mafunzo ya Kiislamu.Siasa na Historia– Aisha alihusika katika matukio ya kihistoria, ikiwemo vita vya sipi baada ya kifo cha Mtume Muhammad (Vita ya Jamal).Hii inathibitisha kuwa nafasi yake haikupunguzwa kwa umri, bali alichangia kwa kiwango kikubwa katika jamii ya Kiislamu.Mjadala wa Kisomi na MaadiliUchunguzi wa hadithi hizi umekua na mjadala mkubwa kimaadili. Wanaochunguza historia ya Kiislamu na hadithi za Mtume wanahoji kama ndoa ya umri mdogo inafaa kutumika kama kielelezo cha maadili leo. Wana hoja kwamba muktadha wa kihistoria ulikuwa tofauti na wa leo, na utamaduni wa wakati huo ulikuwa unakubaliana na ndoa za mapacha wachanga.Hii inapelekea mjadala wa kisomi:Wanaosema umri mdogo:Wanasema hadithi ni ya kihistoria na inapaswa kuaminiwa kama ilivyoandikwa.Wanaosema umri mkubwa:Wanasema muktadha, mashahidi wa nyongeza, na rekodi za kihistoria zinaonyesha kuwa Aisha alikua mkubwa zaidi.Hii inatoa nafasi ya kujadili kwa kina muktadha wa kihistoria na kimaadili wa ndoa ya Mtume Muhammad.HitimishoKwa kumalizia, hadithi inayosema Mtume Muhammad alifariki mikononi mwa Aisha ni muhimu katika uelewa wa historia ya Kiislamu. Ingawa taarifa za umri wa Aisha zinatofautiana, ni wazi kwamba alichangia kwa kiasi kikubwa katika jamii ya Kiislamu. Uchambuzi wa kisomi unahimiza kuzingatia vyanzo vingi, muktadha wa kihistoria, na mjadala wa kimaadili.Mjadala huu unadhihirisha umuhimu wakusoma historia kwa makinina kuzingatia tafsiri za kisasa na za jadi, bila kupuuzia ushahidi wa kihistoria.MarejeoGuillaume, A.

    "full_content": "Allah na Muhammad Wamemkopia Mtume Paulo: Uchanganuzi wa KitaalumaNa: Dr. Maxwell ShimbaUtanguliziMijadala kuhusu uhusiano kati ya Qur’an na Biblia imekuwa ikijitokeza mara kwa mara katika uwanja wa theolojia na falsafa ya dini. Swali kuu ni: Je, Qur’an ni ufunuo mpya kutoka kwa Allah, au ni mkusanyiko wa masimulizi yaliyotokana na maandiko ya Biblia? Kwa uchunguzi wa kitaaluma, ni wazi kwamba sehemu kubwa ya Qur’an inajengwa juu ya simulizi na mafundisho yaliyokuwepo katika Biblia maelfu ya miaka kabla ya Muhammad. Hoja hii inaleta hitimisho kwamba Muhammad na Allah waliegemea sana mafundisho ya Biblia na kwa namna fulani kumkopia Mtume Paulo, ambaye alieneza Injili ya Yesu Kristo kwa mataifa.1. Qur’an na Urejeleo wa BibliaQur’an imejaa marejeo ya moja kwa moja ya simulizi za kibiblia, zikiwemo:Yusufu(Sura ya 12 – Surat Yusuf), simulizi lililokuwapo katika Biblia takriban miaka 3500 kabla ya Qur’an.Imran na familia yake(Sura ya 3 – Surat Al Imran), iliyoelezwa Biblia miaka 3000 kabla ya Muhammad.Yona mwana wa Mittai(Sura ya 10 – Surat Yunus), simulizi lililojulikana tayari katika Agano la Kale.Ibrahimu(Sura ya 14 – Surat Ibrahim), Baba wa Imani, ambaye simulizi zake ziliandikwa Biblia karne nyingi kabla.Maria mama wa Yesu(Sura ya 19 – Surat Maryam), simulizi la kibiblia lililotangulia sana Qur’an.Aidha majina na habari za manabii wakubwa kama Musa, Haruni, Daudi, Sulemani, Yakobo, Isa, na Yohana Mbatizaji, yamechukuliwa moja kwa moja kutoka Biblia. Qur’an hata hivyo haijawahi kutoa simulizi mpya, bali imetoa muhtasari usio na kina wa habari zilizokwishajulikana kwa Wayahudi na Wakristo.2. Ushahidi wa Qur’an Kuhusu Chanzo cha HabariQur’an yenyewe inakiri kuwa Muhammad alisimuliwa habari za manabii na hakupewa ufunuo mpya kuhusu wao:Qur’an 4:164– “...na mitume wengine hatukukuhadithia habari zao, na Mwenyezi Mungu alimsemeza Musa.”Qur’an 40:78– “...miongoni mwao tumekusimulia, na miongoni mwao hatukukusimulia.”Aya hizi zinathibitisha kuwa Muhammad alitegemea masimulizi yaliyokuwepo, badala ya kupokea ufunuo wa kipekee. Hii inapingana na madai ya Wahyi mpya, na inathibitisha urejeleo wa maandiko ya Biblia.3. Qur’an Inavyowaamuru Waislamu Kurudi Kwenye BibliaQur’an mara kadhaa inawaelekeza wafuasi wake warejee katika vitabu vya awali (Torati na Injili):Al-An’aam 6:154–155– Musa alipewa Kitabu kilicho na maelezo ya kila kitu, na watu wakaamrishwa wakifuate.An-Nisaa 4:136– Waislamu wanahimizwa waamini vitabu vilivyoteremshwa kabla ya Muhammad.Al-Maaida 5:46– Injili ni nuru na uwongofu; yeyote aikataye hana nuru.Yunus 10:94– Muhammad mwenyewe aliambiwa akipata shaka, aulize kwa wale wanaosoma Maandiko yaliyokuwa kabla yake.Kwa hiyo, hoja ya Waislamu kuwa Biblia imechakachuliwa inapingana moja kwa moja na Qur’an. Ikiwa Biblia ingekuwa imepotoshwa, basi Allah asingewaelekeza wafuasi wake warejee humo.4. Hoja Dhidi ya Waislamu Wapinga BibliaKudai Biblia ni ya Paulo– Ikiwa kweli ni ya Paulo, kwa nini simulizi zake zimo katika Qur’an? Hii inamaanisha Allah na Muhammad walimkopa Paulo, na kwa mantiki hiyo Paulo anakuwa “akbar” (mkubwa) mbele ya Allah na Muhammad.Kudai Biblia imechakachuliwa– Ikiwa imechakachuliwa, kwa nini Qur’an imejaa marejeo yake na kwa nini Allah aliwaamuru warejee humo?5. HitimishoKwa uchambuzi wa kitaaluma, ni dhahiri kwamba:Qur’an imejengwa juu ya simulizi za Biblia.Muhammad hakupokea ufunuo mpya, bali alisimuliwa habari zilizokuwa tayari katika Biblia.Qur’an yenyewe inakiri na kuthibitisha uhalali wa Maandiko ya awali, ikiwemo Torati na Injili.Hoja za Waislamu dhidi ya Biblia zinapingana na ushahidi wa Qur’an.Kwa hiyo, hoja inabaki kuwa:Allah na Muhammad walimkopia Mtume Paulo na Biblia nzima. Paulo, kwa maana hiyo, anakuwa mkubwa mbele ya Muhammad na Allah, kwani maandiko yake yamekuwa msingi wa masimulizi ya Qur’an.Mwisho, wito unabaki pale pale:Njoo kwa Yesu Kristo, Mungu Mkuu, aliyefunuliwa katika Biblia, ambaye ndiye nuru na wokovu wa ulimwengu wote.",

    "full_content": "Muhammad’s Bribing People to Be/Remain MuslimsThe Quran states that part of the money given in charity is to go towards enticing individuals to become Muslims. In other words, Allah sanctions Muslims to buy off or bribe non-Muslims to embrace Islam:As-Sadaqat(here it means Zakat) are only for theFuqara’(poor), andAl-Masakin(the poor) and those employed to collect (the funds);and for to attract the hearts of those who have been inclined (towards Islam); and to free the captives; and for those in debt; and for Allah’s Cause (i.e. forMujahidun– those fighting in the holy wars), and for the wayfarer (a traveller who is cut off from everything); a duty imposed by Allah. And Allah is All-Knower, All-Wise. S. 9:60 Hilali-KhanHere’s how some of Islam’s greatest expositors interpreted this text. All emphasis will be mine.The voluntary almsgivings the alms to be dispensed are only for the poor who cannot find anything to suffice them in the least and the needy who cannot find anything to suffice them and those who work with them that is with these alms in other words the one who collects them the one who takes the oaths from those who claim them the slave to be manumitted by contract as well as the tax-summoner;and those whose hearts are to be reconciled so that they might become Muslims or that Islam might be firmly established or that their peers might become Muslims or that they might defend Muslims all of whom are classed according to different categories. According to al-Shāfi‘ī the first and the last of these categories are no longer given of the alms-tax today because of the established power of Islam; in contrast the other two categories are given of the alms-tax according to the sounder opinion; and for the manumission of slaves that is for slaves to be manumitted by contract and for the debtors those in debt if they have taken out a debt without intending thereby an act of disobedience or those who have repented but have nothing with which to fulfil the penalty of expiation or to set things right between people even if they be wealthy; and for the way of God that is for those who are engaged in the struggle of those for whom there is no share of the booty fay’ even if they be wealthy; and for the traveller the one cut off from resources during his journey — a duty imposed by God farīdatan ‘a duty’ is in the accusative because of an implied verb sc. faradahā ‘which He has imposed’. And God is Knower of His creatures Wise in His actions. Thus it is impermissible to dispense these alms-proceeds other than to these categories or to deny these proceeds to any one of these categories if they exist. The Imam must divide these proceeds among them equally but he is permitted to give priority to certain individuals over others within any one category. The lām of li’l-fuqarā’ ‘for the poor’ indicates that it is obligatory to include every individual of these categories in the distribution of the proceeds; it is not however obligatory to do so when the person in charge of the monies has to apportion it but finds that it is insufficient. Indeed in such a situation it suffices to give three individuals from each category but anything less than that is not sufficient as is indicated by the plural form. The Sunna shows that the prerequisite condition for receiving a share of such monies is that the person be a Muslim but not a Hashimī or a Muttālibī. (Tafsir al-Jalalaynhttps://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=0&tTafsirNo=74&tSoraNo=9&tAyahNo=60&tDisplay=yes&UserProfile=0&LanguageId=2)Allah then explained who is entitled to these alms, saying: (The alms are only for the poor) for the folk of the Platform (and the needy) among the pilgrims, (and those who collect them) i.e. the collectors of alms,(and those whose hearts are to be reconciled) by giving them gifts such as Abu Sufyan and his companions. These were 15 men, (and to free the captives) the captives who want to ransom themselves (and the debtors) those who incurred debts to fulfil works which are for the obedience of Allah, (and for the cause of Allah) and for the fighters for the cause of Allah, (and (for) the wayfarers) guests, the passer-by; (a duty imposed by Allah) an allotment from Allah for these. (Allah is Knower) of these, (Wise) regarding that which He has ordained for these categories of people. (Tanwîr al-Miqbâs min Tafsîr Ibn ‘Abbâshttps://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=0&tTafsirNo=73&tSoraNo=9&tAyahNo=60&tDisplay=yes&UserProfile=0&LanguageId=2)Those employed to collect AlmsThose employed to collect alms deserve a part of the alms, unless they are relatives of the Messenger of Allah, who are not allowed to accept any Sadaqah. Muslim recorded that `Abdul-Muttalib bin Rabi`ah bin Al-Harith and Al-Fadl bin Al-`Abbas went to the Messenger of Allah asking him to employ them to collect the alms. The Messenger replied…(Verily, the alms are not allowed for Muhammad nor the relatives of Muhammad, for it is only the dirt that the people discard.) Al-Mu’allafatu Qulubuhum There are several types of Al-Mu’allafatu Qulubuhum.There are those who are given alms to embrace Islam. For instance, the Prophet of Allah gave something to Safwan bin Umayyah from the war spoils of Hunayn, even though he attended it while a Mushrik. Safwan said, “He kept giving me until he became the dearest person to me after he had been the most hated person to me.” Imam Ahmad recorded that Safwan bin Umayyah said, “The Messenger of Allah gave me (from the spoils of) Hunayn while he was the most hateful person to me. He kept giving me until he became the most beloved person to me.” Muslim and At-Tirmidhi collected this Hadith, as well. Some of Al-Mu’allafatu Qulubuhum are given from almsso that they become better in Islam and their heart firmer in faith. For instance,the Prophet gave some of the chiefs of the Tulaqa’ a hundred camels each after the battle of Hunayn, saying…(I give a man (from the alms) while another man is dearer to me than him, for fear that Allah might throw him on his face in the fire of Jahannam.) It is recorded in the Two Sahihs that Abu Sa`id said that `Ali sent the Messenger of Allah a gold nugget still in its dirt from Yemen.The Prophet divided it between four men: Al-Aqra` bin Habis, `Uyaynah bin Badr, `Alqamah bin `Ulathah and Zayd Al-Khayr, saying…(To draw their hearts closer.)Some people are givenbecause some of his peers might embrace Islam, while others are given to collect alms from surrounding areas, or to defend Muslim outposts. Allah knows best. (Tafsir Ibn Kathirhttps://www.alim.org/tafsir/ibn-kathir/?surah=9&ayah=60)The so-called authentic narrations provide instances where Muhammad paid off folks to become and/or remain Muslims:Narrated ‘Amr bin Taghlib:Allah’s Apostle gave (gifts) to some people to the exclusion of some others. The latter seemed to be displeased by that. The Prophet said, “I give to some people, lest they should deviate from True Faith or lose patience, while I refer other people to the goodness and contentment which Allah has put in their hearts, and ‘Amr bin Taghlib is amongst them.” ‘Amr bin Taghlib said, “The statement of Allah’s Apostle is dearer to me than red camels.”Narrated Al-Hasan: ‘Amr bin Taghlib told us that Allah’s Apostle got some property or some war prisoners and he distributed them in the above way (i.e. giving to some people to the exclusion of others).(Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 53, Number 373:https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3145)Narrated Anas:The Prophet said, “I give to Quraish people in order to let them adhere to Islam, for they are near to their life of Ignorance (i.e. they have newly embraced Islamand it is still not strong in their hearts).”(Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 53, Number 374:https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3146)Narrated Anas bin Malik:When Allah favored His Apostle with the properties of Hawazin tribe as Fai (booty),he started giving to some Quraish men even up to one-hundred camels each, whereupon some Ansari men said about Allah’s Apostle, “May Allah forgive His Apostle! He is giving to (men of) Quraish and leaves us, in spite of the fact that our swords are still dropping blood (of the infidels).” When Allah’s Apostle was informed of what they had said, he called the Ansar and gathered them in a leather tent and did not call anybody else along with them. When they gathered, Allah’s Apostle came to them and said, “What is the statement which, I have been informed, and that which you have said?” The learned ones among them replied, “O Allah’s Apostle! The wise ones amongst us did not say anything, but the youngsters amongst us said, ‘May Allah forgive His Apostle;he gives the Quraish and leaves the Ansar, in spite of the fact that our swords are still dribbling (wet) with the blood of the infidels.’” Allah’s Apostle replied, “I give to such people as are still close to the period of Infidelity (i.e. they have recently embraced Islam and Faith is still weak in their hearts). Won’t you be pleased to see people go with fortune, while you return with Allah’s Apostle to your houses? By Allah, what you will return with is better than what they are returning with.” The Ansar replied, “Yes, O Allah’s Apostle, we are satisfied.” Then the Prophet said to them, “You will find after me others being preferred to you. Then be patient till you meet Allah and meet His Apostle at Al-Kauthar (i.e. a fount in Paradise).” (Anas added:) But we did not remain patient.(Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 53, Number 375:https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3147)A religion which needs to pay off individuals to embrace it simply cannot be from the true God. It is Satan who would use the riches and pleasures of the world to make folks convert to a particular belief or tradition.",

He was a man of retiring disposition, addicted toprayerandfasting,and was subject to epileptic fits. In his fortieth year (A.D. 612), he claimed to have received a call from theAngel Gabriel, and thus began his active career as theprophetofAllahand theapostleofArabia… He took the field against his enemies, conquered severalArabian,Jewish, andChristiantribes, enteredMeccain triumph in 630, demolished theidolsof the Kaaba, became master ofArabia, and finally united all the tribes under one emblem and one religion. In 632 he made his lastpilgrimagetoMeccaat the head of forty thousand followers, and soon after his return died of aviolentfever in the sixty-third year of his age, the eleventh of the Hejira, and the year 633 of theChristianera.The sources of Mohammed’s biography are numerous,but on the whole untrustworthy, being crowded with fictitious details, legends, and stories. None of his biographies were compiled during his lifetime, and the earliest was written a century and a half after his death. TheKoranis perhaps the only reliable source for the leading events in his career. His earliest and chief biographers are Ibn Ishaq (A.H. 151=A.D. 768), Wakidi (207=822), Ibn Hisham (213=828), Ibn Sa’d (230=845), Tirmidhi (279=892), Tabari (310-929), the “Lives of the Companions of Mohammed”, the numerousKoraniccommentators [especially Tabari, quoted above, Zamakhshari 538=1144), and Baidawi (691=1292)], the “Musnad”, or collection of traditions of Ahmad ibn Hanbal (241=855), the collections of Bokhari (256=870), the “Isabah”, or “Dictionary of Persons who knew Mohammed”, by Ibn Hajar, etc. All these collections and biographies are based on the so-called Hadiths, or “traditions”, the historical value of which is more thandoubtful.These traditions, in fact, represent a gradual, and more or less artificial, legendary development, rather than supplementary historical information. According to them, Mohammed was simple in his habits, but most careful of his personal appearance. He loved perfumes andhatedstrong drink. Of a highly nervous temperament, he shrank from bodily pain. Though gifted with great powers ofimagination, he was taciturn. He was affectionate and magnanimous,piousand austere in the practice of his religion,brave,zealous, and above reproach in his personal andfamilyconduct.Palgrave, however, wisely remarks that “the ideals ofArabvirtuewere first conceived and then attributed to him“. Nevertheless, with every allowance for exaggeration, Mohammed is shown by his life and deeds to have been a man of dauntlesscourage, great generalship, strongpatriotism, merciful by nature, and quick to forgive.And yet he was ruthless in his dealings with theJews, when once he had ceased to hope for their submission. He approved ofassassination, when it furthered his cause; however barbarous or treacherous the means, the end justified it in his eyes; and in more than one case he not only approved, but also instigated the crime.Concerning hismoralcharacterand sincerity, contradictory opinions have been expressed by scholars in the last three centuries. Many of these opinions are biased either by an extremehatredof Islam and its founder or by an exaggerated admiration, coupled with ahatredofChristianity.Lutherlooked upon him as “adevilandfirst-bornchild ofSatan“. Maracci held that Mohammed and Mohammedanism were not very dissimilar toLutherandProtestantism. Spanheim and D’Herbelot characterize himas a “wickedimpostor“, and a “dastardlyliar“, while Prideaux stamps himas a wilful deceiver. Such indiscriminate abuse is unsupported by facts.Modern scholars, such as Sprenger, Noldeke, Weil, Muir, Koelle, Grimme, Margoliouth, give us a more correct and unbiased estimate of Mohammed’s life andcharacter, and substantially agree as to his motives, prophetic call, personal qualifications, and sincerity. The various estimates of several recent critics have been ably collected and summarized by Zwemer, in his “Islam, a Challenge to Faith” (New York, 1907). According to Sir William Muir, Marcus Dods, and some others, Mohammed was at first sincere,but later, carried away by success, he practiseddeceptionwherever it would gain his end. Koelle “finds the key to the first period of Mohammed’s life in Khadija, his first wife”,after whose death he became a prey to hisevilpassions. Sprenger attributes the allegedrevelationsto epileptic fits, or to “a paroxysm of catalepticinsanity“.Zwemer himself goes on to criticize the life of Mohammed by the standards, first, of theOldandNew Testaments, both of which Mohammed acknowledged asDivine revelation; second, by thepaganmoralityof hisArabiancompatriots; lastly,by the newlawof which he PRETENDED to be the “divinely appointed medium and custodian”. According to this author, theprophetwasfalseeven to theethicaltraditions of theidolatrousbrigands among whom he lived, and grossly violated the easy sexualmoralityof his own system. After this, it is hardlynecessaryto say that, in Zwemer’s opinion,Mohammed fell very far short of the most elementary requirements ofScripturalmorality. Quoting Johnstone, Zwemer concludes by remarkingthat the judgment of these modern scholars, however harsh, rests on evidence which “comes all from the lips and the pens of his own devoted adherents. . .And the followers of theprophetcan scarcely complain if, even on such evidence, the verdict of history goes against him“.TenetsThe principal tents of Mohammedanism are laid down in theKoran. As aids in interpreting the religious system of theKoranwe have:first, the so-called “Traditions”, which are supposed to contain supplementary teachings and doctrine of Mohammed,a very considerable part of which, however, is decidedly spurious;second, the consensus of thedoctorsof Islam represented by the most celebrated imâms, the founders of the various Islamicsects, theKoraniccommentators and the masters of Mohammedansjurisprudence;third, theanalogy, ordeductionfrom recognized principles admitted in theKoranand in the Traditions.Mohammed’s religion, known among its adherents as Islam, contains practically NOTHING ORIGINAL; it is A CONFUSED combination of nativeArabianheathenism,Judaism,Christianity,Sabiism (Mandoeanism), Hanifism, andZoroastrianism…(1) DogmaThe doctrines of Islam concerningGod— HisunityandDivine attributes—are essentially those of theBible; but to the doctrines of theTrinityand of theDivine SonshipofChristMohammed had the strongest antipathy.As Noldeke remarks, Mohammed’s acquaintance with those twodogmaswas superficial; even the clauses of theCreedthat referred to them were not properlyknownto him, and thus he felt that it was quite impossible to bring them into harmony with the simpleSemiticMonotheism; probably, too, it was this consideration alone that hindered him from embracingChristianity(Sketches from Eastern History, 62).The number ofprophetssent byGodis said to have been about 124,000, and ofapostles, 315. Of the former, 22 are mentioned by name in theKoran— such asAdam,Noah,Abraham,Moses,Jesus.According to the Sunni, theProphetsandApostleswere sinless and superior to theangels, and they had the power of performingmiracles. Mohammedan angelology anddemonologyare almost wholly based on laterJewishand earlyChristiantraditions. Theangelsarebelievedto be free from allsin; they neither eat nor drink; there is no distinction of sex among them. They are, as a rule, invisible, save to animals, although, at times, they appear inhumanform. The principalangelsare:Gabriel, the guardian and communicator ofGod’s revelationtoman;Michael, the guardian ofmen; Azrail, theangelof death, whosedutyis to receivemen’ssoulswhen they die; and Israfil, theangelof theResurrection.In addition to these there are theSeraphim, who surround the throne ofGod, constantlychantingHis praises; the Secretaries, who record the actions ofmen; the Observers, who spy on every word and deed ofmankind; the Travellers, whosedutyit is to traverse the whole earth in order toknowwhether, and when,menutter the name ofGod; theAngelsof the Seven Planets; theAngelswho have charge ofhell; and a countless multitude ofheavenlybeings who fill allspace. The chiefdevilis Iblis, who, like his numerous companions, was once the nearest toGod, but was cast out for refusing to pay homage toAdamat the command ofGod. Thesedevilsare harmful both to thesoulsand to the bodies ofmen, although theirevilinfluence is constantly checked by Divine interference.Besidesangelsanddevils, there are also jinns, or genii, creatures of fire, able to eat, drink, propagate, and die; somegood, othersbad, but all capable of futuresalvationand damnation.Godrewardsgoodand punishesevil deeds. He is merciful and is easily propitiated byrepentance. The punishment of the impenitent wicked will be fearful, and the reward of the faithful great. Allmenwill have torise from the deadand submit to theuniversal judgment. The Day ofResurrectionand ofJudgmentwill be preceded and accompanied by seventeen fearful, or greater, signs inheavenand on earth, and eight lesser ones, some of which are identical with those mentioned in theNew Testament. TheResurrectionwill be general and will extend to all creatures —angels, jinns,men, and brutes.The torments ofhelland the pleasures ofParadise, but especially the latter, are proverbially crass and sensual.Hellis divided into seven regions: Jahannam, reserved for faithless Mohammedans; Laza, for theJews; Al-Hutama, for theChristians; Al-Sair, for theSabians; Al-Saqar, for the Magians; Al-Jahim, foridolaters; Al-Hawiyat, forhypocrites. As to the torments ofhell, it isbelievedthat the damned will dwell amid pestilential winds and in scalding water, and in the shadow of a black smoke.Draughts of boiling water will be forced down their throats. They will be dragged by the scalp, flung into the fire, wrapped in garments of flame, and beaten with iron maces. When their skins are well burned, other skins will be given them for their greater torture. While the damnation of allinfidelswill be hopeless andeternal, the Moslems, who, though holding thetruereligion, have been guilty of heinoussins, will be delivered fromhellafter expiating their crimes.The joys andgloriesofParadiseare as fantastic and sensual as the lasciviousArabianmindcould possibly imagine. “As plenty of water is one of the greatest additions to the delights of the BedouinArab, theKoranoften speaks of the rivers ofParadiseas a principal ornament thereof; some of these streams flow with water, some with wine and others with honey, besides many other lesser springs and fountains, whose pebbles are rubies and emeralds, while their earth consists of camphor, their beds of musk, and their sides of saffron.But all theseglorieswill be eclipsed by the resplendent and ravishing girls, orhouris, ofParadise, the enjoyment of whose company will be the principalfelicityof the faithful. These maidens arecreatednot of clay, as in the case of mortalwomen, but of pure musk, and free from all natural impurities, defects, and inconveniences. They will be beautiful and modest and secluded from public view in pavilions of hollow pearls.The pleasures ofParadisewill be so overwhelming thatGodwill give to everyone the potentialities of a hundredindividuals. To eachindividualsa large mansion will be assigned, and the very meanest will have at his disposalat least 80,000 servants and seventy-two wives of the girls ofParadise. While eating they will be waited on by 300 attendants, the food being served in dishes of gold, whereof 300 shall be set before him at once, containing each a different kind of food, and an inexhaustible supply of wine and liquors. The magnificence of the garments and gems is conformable to the delicacy of their diet. For they will be clothed in the richest silks and brocades, and adorned with bracelets of gold and silver, and crowns set with pearls, and will make use of silken carpets, couches, pillows, etc., and in order that they may enjoy all these pleasures,Godwill grant them perpetual youth, beauty, and vigour. Music and singing will also be ravishing and everlasting” (Wollaston, “Muhammed, His Life and Doctrines”).The Mohammedan doctrine ofpredestinationis equivalent tofatalism. TheybelieveinGod’sabsolute decree and predetermination both ofgoodand ofevil; viz., whatever has been or shall be in the world, whethergoodorbad, proceeds entirely from the Divine will, and is irrevocably fixed and recorded from alleternity.The possession and the exercise of our ownfree willis, accordingly, futile and useless. The absurdity of this doctrine was felt by later Mohammedantheologians, who sought in vain by various subtile distinctions to minimize it.MoralsIt is hardlynecessaryhere to emphasize the fact that theethicsof Islam are far inferior to those ofJudaismand even more inferior to those of theNew Testament. Furthermore, we cannot agree with Noldeke when he maintains that, although in many respects theethicsof Islam are not to be compared even with suchChristianityas prevailed, and still prevails, in the East, nevertheless, in other points, the newfaith— simple, robust, in the vigour of its youth — far surpassed the religion of theSyrianandEgyptianChristians, which was in a stagnating condition, and steadily sinking lower and lower into the depths of barbarism (op. cit., Wollaston, 71, 72). The history and the development, as well as the past and present religious, social, andethicalcondition of all theChristiannations and countries, no matter of whatsector school they may be, as compared with these of the various Mohammedan countries, in all ages, is a sufficient refutation of Noldeke’s assertion. That in theethicsof Islam there is a great deal to admire and to approve, is beyond dispute;but of originality or superiority, THERE IS NONE. What is reallygoodin Mohammedanethicsis either commonplace or borrowed from some otherreligions, whereas what is characteristic IS NEARLY ALWAYS IMPERFECT OR WICKED.",

It can also be accessed here:Infidels. All emphasis will be mine.Infidels(Latin in, privative, and fidelis.)As in ecclesiastical language those who by baptism have received faith in Jesus Christ and have pledged Him their fidelity and called the faithful, so the name infidel is given to those who have not been baptized. The term applies not only to all who are ignorant of the true God, such as pagans of various kinds,but also to those who adore Him but do not recognize Jesus Christ, as Jews, Mohammedans; strictly speaking it may be used of catechumens also, though in early ages they were called Christians; for it is only through baptism that one can enter into the ranks of the faithful. Those however who have been baptized but do not belong to the Catholic Church, heretics and schismatics of divers confessionsare not called infidels but non-Catholics. The relation in which all these classes stand to the Catholic Church is not the same; in principle, those who have been baptizedare subjects of the Church and her children even though they be rebellious children; they are under her laws or, at least, are exempt from them only so far as pleases the Church. Infidels, on the contrary, are not members of the ecclesiastical society, according to the words of St. Paul: Quid mihi de his qui fortis sunt, judicare? (I Cor., v, 12); they are entirely exempt from the canon law;they need to be enlightened and converted, not punished. Needless to say, infidels do not belong to the supernatural state; if they receive supernatural graces from God, it is not through the channels established by Jesus Christ for Christians, but by a direct personal inspiration, for instance, the grace of conversion. But their condition is not morally bad; negative infidelity, says St. Thomas (II-II, q. x, a. 1), does not partake of the nature of sin, but rather of punishment,in the sense that ignorance of the Faith is a consequence of original sin. That is why the condemnation by the Church of proposition lxviii of Baius: Infidelits pure negativa, in his quibus Christus non et praedicatus,peccatum est (purely negative infidelity in those to whom Christ has not been preached is a sin), was fully justified.But it is different with regard to positive infidelity, which is a sin against faith, the most grievous of all sins, apostasy. Being endowed with reason, and subject to natural law, infidels are not excluded from the moral order; they can perform acts of natural virtue; and so the ecclesiastical authorities had to condemn proposition xxv of Baius which declared that: Omnia infidelium opera peccata sunt, et philosophorum virtutes vitia (all works of infidels are sinful, and all the virtues of the philosophers are vices; cf. St. Thomas, loc. cit., a. 4; Hurter, Theol. dogm., III, thes. cxxvi and cxxvii).Daily experience moreover proves incontestably that there are infidels who really religious, charitable, just, true to their word, upright in their business, and faithful to their family duties. One can say of them, as the Scriptures say of Cornelius the centurion, that their prayers and their alms are acceptable to God (Acts, x, 4). It was especially among such well-meaning infidels that the Church of Jesus grew up, and it is from their ranks that she gains her recruits at the present day in missionary lands.The Church, mindful of the order of the Saviour: Go, teach all nations (Matt., xxviii, 19), has always considered the preaching of the Gospel among the infidels and their conversion by her apostolic missionaries to be one of her principal duties. This is not the place to recall the history of the missions, from the laboursof St. Paul, the greatest of missionaries, and those who gave the light of faith to the Greek and Roman world, and those who converted the barbarian peoples, down through the ages when the phalanxes of religious men rushed to the conquest of the Orient, the Far East, and America, to the present-day pioneers of the religion of Jesus Christ; the multitude of heroes and martyrs and the harvest of souls that have been won to the true Faith. Doubtless, we still are far from having but one fold and one shepherd; nevertheless, there is not to-day a province or race of men so remote,but has not heard the name of Him by whom all men must be saved and has given children to the Church. The work of the missions is placed, as is well known, under the care and direction of the congregation of cardinals that bears the admirable name Da Propaganda Fide (for the propagation of the Faith), instituted by Gregory XV in 1622. Ever encouraged and developed by the popes, it is the directing body on whom the evangelical labourers in infidel lands depend. It sends them forth and grants them their powers, it established the prefectures Apostolic and the vicariates, and it is the tribunal to whose decision the missionaries submit their controversies, difficulties, and doubts.Thought there is a general obligation on the Church to toil for the conversion of infidels, yet it is not incumbent on any particular persons, unless on those priests charged with the care of souls who have infidels within their territory. For the distant fields of labour missionaries, priests, members of religious orders, both men and women, who voluntarily offer themselves for the apostolic work, are recruited in Catholic countries. Native Christians are not excluded from the ranks of the clergy, and it is a duty of the missionaries to provide themselves prudently with auxiliary workers in their missions.To draw the infidels to the Faith, the missionaries ought, like St. Paul, to make themselves all things to all men, adopt the customs of the country, acquire the native language, establish schools and charitable institutions, preach especially by their example, and show in their lives how the religion they have come to teach is to be practiced(cf. Instr. of the Prop. to the Vicars Apostolic of China, in the Collectanea S. C. de Prop. Fide, n. 328). They and their catechists are to instruct with zeal and patience to those who are anxious to know the true religion, admitting them to baptism after longer or shorter period of probation, as was done in the case of the catechumens in ancient times.But the conversion of infidels must be free and without compulsion, otherwise it will not be genuine and lasting(cap. 9, tit. vi, lib. V, de Judaeis). It cannot be denied that at various epochs, notably under Charlemagne and later in Spain,there were forced conversions, which may be explained, though not excused, by the custom of the age; but the Church was not responsible for them, as it has constantly taught that all conversions should be free. On several occasions it expressly forbade the baptism of Jews and infidels against their will, and even the baptism of children without their parents consent, unless they were in imminent danger of death(cf. Collect. cit., De subjecto baptismi). In the rite of administering baptism the Church still asks the questions: Quid petis ab Ecclesia Dei? Vis baptizari?Though ecclesiastical law does not affect the acts of infidels as such, yet the Church has to pass judgment on the validity of these acts and their juridical consequences when infidels come within the fold by baptism. No act of an infidel can have any value from the point of view of the spiritual society to which he does not belong; he is incapable by Divine law of receiving the sacraments, notably Holy orders (evidently we are not speaking here of a purely material reception); nor can he receive or exercise any ecclesiastical jurisdiction.The acts of infidels are to be considered in the light of natural law, to which they, like all men, are subject, and in accordance with the Divine law, in so far as it determines the secondary natural law. This applies principally to the case of matrimony.The marriage of infidels is valid as a contract under natural law, not as a sacrament, though at times this word has been applied to it(cf. Encycl. Arcanum);it is subject only to the impediments of natural law and, at times, to those of the civil law also, but it is not affected by the impediments of canon law. However the Church does not recognize polygamy as lawful among infidels; as to divorce strictly so called, it admits it only under the form of the Casus Apostoli, also known as the privilege of the Faith or the Pauline privilege; this consists in a convert being permitted to abandon his partner, who remains an infidel, if the latter refuse to continue the common life without endangering the faith of the convert(cf. DIVORCE, I, B, 1); under such circumstances the convert may marry a Catholic. As to acts which are prohibited or void in virtue of canon law alone, they are valid when performed by infidels; thus, the impediment of the remoter degrees of consanguinity and affinity, etc., does not affect the marriages of infidels. But the juridical consequences of the acts, performed by them when infidels,begin to exist at the moment of and in virtue of their baptism; consequently, a converted widower may not marry a relative of his late wife without dispensation; and again, a man who has had two wives before his conversion is a bigamist and therefore irregular.Most of the laws passed by the Church refer to the relations between its subjects and infidels in not only religious but also civil affairs.Speaking generally, the faithful are forbidden to take part in any religious rites, considered as such, of pagans, Mohammedans, or Jews, and all the more to practice them through a kind of survival of their primitive superstitions. If this prohibition is inspired not so much by a fear of the danger of perversion as by the law forbidding the faithful to communicate in sacris with non-Catholics,aversion to false religions and especially from idol worship justifies the rigor of the law. To mention but the principal acts, the faithful are forbidden to venerate idols, not only in their temples, but also in private houses, to contribute to the building or repairing of pagan temples or of mosques, to carve idols, to join in pagan sacrifices, to assist at Jewish circumcisions, to wear idolatrous images or objects having an acknowledged religious significance, so that the fact of wearing them is looked upon as an act of pagan worship, and finally to make use of superstitious and especially idolatrous practices in the acts of civil or domestic life. Some very delicate questions may arise in connection with the last prohibition; for instance, we may recall the celebrated controversy concerning the Chinese rites (see CHINA).On the other hand, it is not forbidden to enter temples and mosques out of mere curiosity if no act of religion be performed, or to eat food that has been offered to false gods, provided that this be not done in a temple or as a sacred repast, and that it be done without scandal; or to observe customs or perform acts which are not in themselves religious, even though pagans join superstitious practices to them. Not only is it not forbidden, but it is permissible and one might say obligatory to pray even publicly for infidel princes, in order that God may grant their subjects peace and prosperity; nothing is more conformable to the tradition of the Church; thus Catholics of the different rites in the Ottoman Empire pray for the sultan.In this place mention may be made of the ecclesiastical law forbidding the faithful to marry infidels, a prohibition which is now a diriment impediment, rendering a marriage null and void unless a dispensation has been obtained(see DISPARITY OF WORSHIP). It is easy to see that there is a real danger to the faith and religious life of the Catholic party in the intimacy of married life and in the difficulties in the way of a Christian education of the children;and, if that party be the wife, in the excessive authority of the husband and the inferior condition of the wife in infidel countries; consequently, this dispensation is granted only with difficulty and when the precautions dictated by prudence have been taken. The laws regulating the dealings between Catholics and infidels in civil life were inspired also by religious motives, the danger of perversion, and the high idea entertained in the ages of faith of the superiority of Christians to infidels. These regulations, of course, did not refer to all acts of civil life; moreover, they were not directed against all infidels indifferently, but only against Jews; at the present day they have fallen almost completely into desuetude.In the early Middle Ages, Jews were forbidden to have Christian slaves; the laws of the decretals forbade Christians to enter the service of Jews, or Christian women to act as their nurses or midwives; moreover, Christians when ill were not to have recourse to Jewish physicians. These measures may be useful in certain countries to-day and we find them renewed, at least as recommendations, by recent councils(Council of Gran, in 1858; Prague, in 1860; and Utrecht, in 1865).As for the Jews, they were ordinarily restricted to certain definite quarters of the towns into which they were admitted, and had to wear a dress by which they might be recognized. Modern legislation has given the Jews the same rights as other citizens and the intercourse between them and Catholics in civil life is no longer governed by ecclesiastical law.

And as for interfaith relations of our Church, one of the strongest bonds, perhaps, is the one that links you and me.“Orthodox Christians and Muslims co-exist in Russia but, by God’s mercy, our country has never known religious wars. We were brought up that way, and the same was true of the pre-revolutionary Russia – the tsars saw to it that no conflicts occurred between Orthodox Christians and Muslims. You know that there were Muslim military leaders at court, in the head of state’s entourage. That is, the Islamic Ummah, the Muslims, be it in times when they were subjects of the Russian Empire or citizens of the Soviet Union but especially nowadays constitute an essential factor in strengthening inter-ethnic peace in Russia, serving as a bridge that helps Russia develop its relations with the Islamic world and, of course, as a bridge between our two peoples.“Once again, I would like to emphasise your personal contribution. You have always been well-disposed towards the Orthodoxy, towards our people, and I could feel your good attitude towards me. You have always spoken frankly and cordially, with your words being in line with your actions at all times.“When it comes to diplomacy in a good sense of this word – not as an art of achieving one’s political goals by any means, but as an instrument intended to ensure the development of good relations among countries and nations – the diplomacy you engage in, with your talent and authority, certainly brings great benefit to our countries and peoples. I wholeheartedly thank you for that.“Friendship between our two countries and peoples, our two presidents’ policy and our countries’ economic, political and cultural cooperation – all these significant factors create a unique atmosphere in the relationship between Russia and your blessed country, as well as in our relations as religious leaders. I would like to reiterate that the relations between Muslims and Orthodox Christians in our two countries play an important role in strengthening inter-state ties.Therefore, by serving an important cause of establishing mutual understanding between people who believe in Godwe at the same time help strengthen inter-state relations and bonds between our two nations.“With all my heart, I wish prosperity to Azerbaijan and success to your remarkable leader, who is a really talented politician and a person of high, including political, culture. I would like to cordially thank you for the hospitality. I always feel this special cordiality when I meet with you, your colleagues and brothers here. I would like to assure you of my reciprocal warm feelings. Time and again, I wish help from above to you and all your relatives, friends and colleagues. May we all continue to work together in furthering Azerbaijan-Russia relations.”To conclude the meeting, Sheikh ul-Islam Allahshukur Pashazade and His Holiness Patriarch Kirill exchanged memorable gifts. (Emphasis mine)That’s not all. This next section is taken fromAddress by Patriarch KIRILL of Moscow and All Russia atmeeting of Russia-Islam Strategic Vision Group.On the 19th of May, 2023, His Holiness Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and All Rus’, who is making a Patriarchal visit to Tatarstan, took part in a meeting of Russia-Islam Strategic Vision Group held at the Kazan City Hall and addressed the audience.Address by Patriarch KIRILL of Moscow and All Russia at the meeting of Russia-Islam Strategic Vision GroupKazan, 18thMay 2023Dear Rustam Nurgaliyevich,Dear Muslim religious leaders,dear participants in the forum,I greet you with all my heart, happy to be here with you today, on the blessed Kazan land, and take part in this important meeting.Russia has long-standing relations with the Muslim world. Since the Russia-Islam Strategic Vision Group was set up, the Russian Orthodox Church has been actively engaging in its work.Our meeting takes place in Kazan. The capital of Tatarstan, perhaps like no other place in Russia, is a visual symbol of fruitful cooperation between people of different faiths for the good of their country and nation. In this city, mosques stand next to churches; Muslim and Orthodox theology is flourishing. Here Christians and Muslims work together for the benefit of the entire society.I would like to thank esteemed Rustam Nurgaliyevich Minnikhanov, head of the Republic of Tatarstan, for organising this important event. Traditionally, the head of the Kazan Metropolia acts as representative of the Russian Church in the Russia-Islam Strategic Vision Group. Metropolitan Feofan of blessed memory did much in that capacity, and now his successor, Metropolitan Kirill of Kazan and Tatarstan, who is present here, is one of the Group members.As we look at what is going on in the world, we cannot but see that Western interference in the affairs of other countries, in particular, the Middle East has had sorrowful consequences. Less than a month ago it was the 10thanniversary of the abduction of two metropolitans of Aleppo in Syria. Metropolitans Paul of the Orthodox Church of Antioch and Mar Gregorios Yohanna were kidnapped by terrorists and we still do not know what happened to those remarkable religious leaders. The so-called “Arab Spring” only brought sorrow and countless tribulations to people of those countries, the majority of them Muslims. The Western forces were trying to use a religious factor to destroy those countries’ statehood, to sow enmity and provoke divisions on religious grounds in society. It resulted in an outburst of brutality and violence, and a surge in terror attacks committed under religious slogans. Our own history and the history of other countries clearly show that such approach is inadmissible. We – Christians and Muslims – have to stand against extremism, and in this regard the work of the Russia-Islam Strategic Vision Group is of particular value and significance.For decades, the Moscow Patriarchate has been maintaining brotherly relations with Islamic leaders and organisations. In recent years, these contacts have intensified considerably. It is gratifying to note that every such meeting is held in the atmosphere of mutual understanding. The Department for External Church Relations of the Moscow Patriarchate has been taking part in this work for many years. In November 2018, the Expert Council under the Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia for Cooperation with the Islamic World was established. Not long ago, we met with the Secretary General of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and the head of the Muslim World League. This February, Russian and Iranian theologians held their 12thmeeting in Moscow, continuing the dialogue that began more than 25 years ago.Almost 25 years ago the Interreligious Council of Russia was established.MY BROTHERS, leaders of the Islamic and Judaic communities in Russia, and I founded it in December 1998. The Council helps the leaders of traditional religions –Orthodoxy, Islam, Judaism AND BUDDHISM– to coordinate their work, exchange views on various topical issues and appeal to authorities and society on behalf of our faithful. The Patriarch is the Honorary Chairman of this organisation. Metropolitan Anthony of Volokolamsk represents Orthodox Christians in the Council’s Presidium. Muslims are represented by the heads of the major Muslims’ Spiritual Boards, including the Mufti of Tatarstan and the head of the Muslim Coordinating Centre for the North Caucasus.Why does the Russian Orthodox Church maintain such close relations with the Muslim Ummah in and outside Russia?Because our fundamental values are alike. Orthodox Christians and Muslims strive to act according to God’s will. It is an essential principle of OUR life. We are conservative in a good way, for Orthodox Christians and Muslims resolutely reject any attempts to make sin a social norm. For us the unnatural confusion of the sexes and the so-called LGBT ideology are absolutely unacceptable.We seek to preserve traditional, God-commanded form of family. Whatever is used to justify the egoistic attitude to people and to the world, it is evident that it substitutes serving God for serving one’s passions, which turns a person into a prisoner of his or her own vices.Faithful to our spiritual ideals, we can work together in opposing the sophisticated propaganda of individualism and the worship of the human being.Orthodox Christians and Muslims are called to uphold their moral values, live up to the ideals of good, love, mercy, justice and mutual respect.WE, Christians and Muslims, know and confess that God is the true Creator of the world and the Only Lawmaker. Where God is forgotten, there evil reigns.A great Russian writer whose influence on our self-awareness was enormous – Fyodor Dostoevsky – expressed this simple but profound idea: If there is now God, then everything is permitted. “If there is no God, then I am god,” says one of the characters, Alexei Kirillov, in his novelDemons. The origin of such thought pattern goes back to the Renaissance period in the European history. However, misinterpreted, freedom made humans slaves of their own passions. And what today is coming to various countries under the guise of freedom is destruction and chaos.I have stated this many times and will say it again – the 21st century’s main challenge comes from the godless secular world and is posed to the traditional system of values rooted in religion. To oppose it, we need to ensure consolidation of those forces in society that are committed to their traditions. If we do not wish to see the victory of evil and the development of a universal cult of sin and egoism, then we should give to this challenge a spiritual rebuff,for our joint efforts can save the world from self-destruction. In this respect Christians and Muslims have sufficient potential – religious, cultural, human, intellectual and economic.To conclude my speech, I would like to express hope that Russia and the Islamic world will develop and broaden their cooperation.The Russian Orthodox Church, which represents the interests of millions of its faithful, is ready TO PROMOTE IT in all possible ways and to exchange experience and knowledge. I believe that today, amid the crisis in international relations, a new possibility is unfolding for us to influence the global agenda so that preservation of the intransient moral values could become one of its primary concerns.I wish you all successful work.Thank you for your attention. (Emphasis mine)So here we have the Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church claiming that Muslims and Eastern Orthodox serve the same true God and seek to carry out his will. The Patriarch even calls the religious leaders of the Muslim and Jewish communities his brothers.",

    "full_content": "Eastern Orthodox on Islam, Judaism & Other ChurchesThe statements cited here are taken fromFor the Life of the World: Toward A Social Ethos of the Orthodox Church, published by Holy Cross Orthodox Press in 2020. The document can be accessed at the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America website:Social Ethos Document. Here is thePDF Version.The readers will see that according to this document the Greek or Eastern Orthodox (EO) do believe and affirm that Muslims and Jews are worshiping the same God as acknowledged by the EO. In fact, the document goes so far as to say that all the people of the world are worshiping the same God and that there are truths in all these religions including those from India and China, which most definitely include Hinduism and Buddhism!These references all come from the section titled,I. Ecumenical Relations and Relations with Other FaithsLet us pray for the unity of allAll emphasis will be mine.§55 God is Father of all the families of the heavens and the earth. God’s Logos pervades all things, and all things were created through his Logos. God’s Spirit is everywhere, enlightening and enlivening all of reality. Thus creation universally declares the power, wisdom, and grace of its maker, while at all times and in all places God is present to those who seek the truth. The Orthodox Church exists as the concrete reality of Christ’s mystical body in time,  always bearing witness tothe light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ. It is for this reason that the Church not only reaches out and witnesses to Orthodoxy to various Christian confessions, with whom the Orthodox Church enjoys historic dialogue, but also reaches outward to meet non-Christian religions and faith communities that are open to the truth and the call of God.In this regard, it also affirms,and has done so since the earliest centuries of the faith, that God’s Logos shines forth in the whole frame of the created world and speaks to all hearts in the still small voice of conscience, and that wherever truth is revered the Spirit of God is at work. St. Justin Martyr, for instance, declared that knowledge of God’s Logos had been imparted by God not only to the children of Israel,but to the Greek philosophers who had never known Christ, and to all peoples, inasmuch as seeds of the eternal Logos have been planted in all human beings; thus, he says, all who have lived in harmony with this Logosare already in some sense Christians, while Christians may claim as their own any and every truth known to the nations of the earth by God’s inspiration.50According to St. Maximus the Confessor, the primordiallogoiunderlying and indwelling all things reside in the one Logos of God, and find their historical center in Christ.51The Church knows, moreover, that the full mystery of God’s Logos transcends human comprehension,and communicates itself in ways too numerous and wonderful to calculate or conceive. The Church thus seeks dialogue with other religious traditions not out of any desire to alter the deposit of its faith, much less out of any anxiety regarding that deposit’s sufficiency, but out of a reverent love for all who seek God and his goodness, and in a firm certitudethat God has left no people without a share in the knowledge of his glory and grace. This is not to deny, of course, that there are many irreconcilable differences between the Church’s understanding of the truth and that of other religious traditions, and it certainly has no desire to obscure this reality. It seeks neither to make compromises regarding her own essential beliefsnor condescendingly to treat those of other faiths as inconsequential. At the same time, knowing that God reveals himself in countless ways and with boundless inventiveness,the Church enters into dialogue with other faiths prepared to be amazed and delighted by the variety and beauty of God’s generous manifestations of divine goodness, grace, and wisdom among all peoples.§56 Though the Orthodox Church seeks deeper bonds of amity with all faiths, it recognizes her unique responsibility with regard to the other two “peoples of the book,” the Abrahamic traditions of Islam and Judaism, with which it has longstanding dialogues and alongside which it has lived for millennia. Therefore,the Church can and does engage the beauty and spiritual truths of Islam in all its multiple traditions, acknowledging points of contact with it especially in its affirmation of the Virgin Birth (Quran 3:47, 19:16-21, 21:91) and its recognition of Jesus as the Messiah, Messenger, Word, and Spirit of God (4:171). Although Orthodoxy cannot agree with Islam in its rejection of the Incarnation and of God as Trinity, it is nevertheless able to pursue meaningful dialogue with all parts of the Islamic Ummah regarding the proper understanding of these central Christian teachings. It believes that the common roots of Christianity and Islam in the Middle East,the common affirmation of the message of the unity of God, as well as the common recognition of the holiness and truth of God’s Word and his Prophets, the importance of prayer and ascesis, as well as the struggle to discern the will of God in all things, invite Islam and Orthodoxy to enter into an intimate conversation for the advancement of peace and understanding among all peoples.§57 As to Judaism, when the eternal Son of God became human he became incarnate as a Jew, born within the body of Israel, an heir to God’s covenants with his chosen people. He came in fulfillment of God’s saving promises to his people, as the Messiah of Israel. The first blood he shed for the redemption of the world was exacted on the day of his circumcision; his first confession before the world concerning the justice of God was in the synagogue, as was the first declaration of his mission to the world (Luke 4:18–21); his ministry resumed the language of the great prophets of Israel; and he was executed by a pagan authority under the title “King of the Jews.” It was to Israel that God declared himself as The One Who Is, to Israel that God gave the Law as a language of love and communion, with Israel that God established an everlasting covenant, and to Israel that he proclaimed, “I will bless those who bless you and curse those who curse you, and in you shall all the families of the earth be blessed” (Genesis 12:3). As the Apostle Paul emphasized, Christians are saved in Christ only in being grafted like wild olive branches into the cultivated olive tree of Israel, and the branches do not support—but rather are supported by—the root (Romans 11:16–24). Orthodox Christians look to the Jewish communities throughout the world not merely as to practitioners of another creed,but as to, in some sense, their spiritual elders in the history of God’s saving revelations, and as to the guardians of that precious inheritance that is the first full manifestation of God’s saving presence in history. It is, sadly, necessary to state these things with a special emphasis at this moment. In recent years, we have witnessed a revival in many quarters of the Western world of the most insidious ideologies of national, religious, and even racial identity in general, and of anti-Semitic movements in particular. Bigotry and violence against Jews have long been a conspicuous evil of the cultures of Christendom; the greatest systematic campaign of mass murder and attempted genocide in European history was undertaken against the Jews of Europe; and—while some Orthodox clergy and laity demonstrated exceptional generosity and even sacrificial compassion to their Jewish brothers and sisters, earning from them the honorific “righteous among the nations”—other historically Orthodox nations have dark histories of anti-Semitic violence and oppression. For all these evils, Christians must seek God’s forgiveness. In expiation for those crimes against the Jewish peoplespecifically committed in Orthodox lands, the Church seeks both God’s forgiveness as well as a deeper relation of love and regard with Jewish communities and the Jewish faith.§58 The story of other non-Orthodox Christian religious traditions is not yet finished, and Orthodoxy affirms that like other non-Orthodox Christian bodies they only find their coherence and clarity within the Orthodox Church.As for other religions, the Orthodox Church takes encouragement from the words of the Apostle Paul to the Athenians at the Areopagus: “What therefore you worship as unknown, this I proclaim to you”(Acts 17:23). From this the Church is given license to proclaimthat the true God in whom all humanity lives and moves and has its beingis worshipped by peoples everywhere, Christian and non-Christian alike. And this makes her only more eager to make all persons and peoples aware that the face of this one true God shines forth unobscured in the face of Jesus Christ. Moreover, the Church—illumined by that radiance—enters into dialogue with other faiths fully prepared to be instructed by many of their own speculative, cultural, and spiritual achievements. It may be that, just as the Church of the early centuries profited fromand in time baptized many of the philosophical, religious, and cultural riches of pre-Christian Europe, Asia Minor, and the Near East, so too may it now discover new ways of articulating the deposit of faith or new ways of thinking about its cultural expressions and conceptual formsby exposure to, say, the great philosophies and faiths OF INDIA, or to the traditions OF CHINA and the greater FAR EAST, or to the spiritual experiences of tribal peoples throughout the world, and so on. Again, as Justin Martyr insisted, whatsoever is true and godly is welcome to us, for the Logos is everywhere and shines forth in all places.50 Justin, FirstApology46. PG6.397B. AndSecond Apology8, 10, and 13. PG 6.457A, 460B, and 465B.51 Maximus,Ambiguum7. PG 91.1081C. SeeOn Difficulties in the Church Fathers, vol. 1, 75–141.And this is what the document states in respect to the other ancient Apostolic Churches:§52 Though visible sacramental unity among all Christians is at present only a remote hope, nothing lies beyond the power of God’s Spirit, and the Church cannot relent in her labors to achieve a final reunion of all who come together in Christ’s name. Until that day, so long as their hearts and minds are open to the promptings of God’s Word and Spirit, Christians of all communions can meet together in love and work together for the transformation of the world. In particular, they can cooperate with one another in works of charity, thereby making God’s love manifest to the world, and in efforts to advance social and civil justice, thereby proclaiming God’s righteousness and peace to all peoples. Moreover, even if they cannot as yet enjoy perfect communion in the full sacramental life of the Church, all Christians are called by their baptism in the Holy Trinity to gather together in prayer, to repent of past misunderstandings and offences against their brothers and sisters, and to love one another as fellow servants and heirs of the Kingdom of God.By this, all shall know that you are my disciples: if you have love for one another(John 13:35).§53 The Orthodox Church enjoys especially close relationswith thosecommunions that are directly descended from the ancient Apostolic Churchand that share something like her understanding of the apostolic charism of episcopal succession and something like her sacramental theology: the ancient churches of Egypt and Ethiopia, of Armenia,of the Assyrian tradition, of Canterbury, and of Rome. Thus, the Church has important bilateral dialogues with the Roman Catholic Church and the Anglican Communion, and it prays that these dialogues may bear fruit in a complete unity with the Church.But all Christian communions are her kin and her love for all is equally unqualified. For more than a century, then, the Orthodox Church has played a leading role in the movement towards Christian unity,out of obedience to our Lord’s supplication and exhortationthat all may be one(John 17:21).The Ecumenical Patriarchate, in particular, has been at the forefront of the Orthodox engagement with Christians of other communions, and has remained a steadfast participant in numerous bilateral and multi-lateral dialogues with other major Christian churches.The Ecumenical Patriarchate was, in fact, one of the founding members of the World Council of Churches, and has continuously maintained an official representative presence at that council’s central offices.§54 In short, the Church is dedicated to a sustained dialogue with other Christians. Dialogue, in the Orthodox understanding, is essentially and primordially a reflection of the dialogue between God and humanity: it is initiated by God and conducted through the divine Logos (dia-logos), our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Pervading all human life, dialogue takes place in all our encounters, personal, social, or political, and must always be extended to those who adhere to religions different from ours. And in all our connections and relationships, the Word of God is mystically present, ever guiding our exchange of words and ideas towards a spiritual union of hearts in him. Naturally, the Orthodox Church considers itself responsible always to interpret other traditions and perspectives in terms of what was revealed to it by God. In so doing, it is open towhatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is pleasing, whatever is commendable(Philippians 4:8), and is ready to rejoice whenever it discovers these in her partners of dialogue. Our commitment to ecumenical relations with other Christian confessions reflects this openness to all who sincerely seek the truth as the incarnate Logos, Jesus Christ, and who remain true to their conscience, even while we continue to bear witness to the fullness of the Christian faith in the Orthodox Church. Moreover, the Church can stand with other Christians in this way not only out of solidarity in light of a shared history and moral vision,but also because such Christian groups, through their Trinitarian baptism and confession of the faith of the Councils, profess and share many aspects of Orthodox teaching and tradition.The readers should pay careful attention to the document unashamedly highlighting the fact that the Ecumenical Patriarchate of the EO was one of the founding members of the World Council of Churches!",

    "full_content": "Patriarch Bartholomew on MuslimsI cite what Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew stated in respect to Muslims and Islam. All emphasis will be mine.Address by His All-Holiness Ecumenical PatriarchBartholomewEsteemed religious leaders, venerable scholars, beloved brothers and sisters,As the golden sun rises over this ancient city, a place where history paints an intricate tableau of religious, cultural, and ethnic pluralism, we gather with purpose and hope. With each exchange of dialogue and every gesture of partnership, we lay down a foundation, connecting centuries of shared history, culture, and values.Historically, the intertwining threads of Christianity and Islam have woven stories of shared existence, bearing testimony to ages of coexistence. As inheritors of this rich legacy, we are summoned today to not only reminisce about our shared past, but to forge ahead, uniting in the face of present-day challenges.At the monumental Holy and Great Council of the Orthodox Church on the island of Crete in 2016, we were reminded: “The Church lives not for herself. She offers herself for the whole of humanity in order to raise up and renew the world into new heavens and a new earth” (Holy and Great Council, 2016). This profound message transcends boundaries, beckoning all of humankind to unite for the greater good.Both Christianity and Islam, SPIRITUAL LEGACIES OF ABRAHAM, provide a reservoir of teachings that advocate peace, mutual respect, and stewardship of God’s creation. The sacred Psalmist beautifully captures the spirit of unity, expressing, “Behold, how good and pleasant it is when brothers dwell in unity!” (Psalms 133:1). Complementing this sentiment, the poetic genius Al-Mutanabbi professes, “He who does not have forbearance, has nothing.” These words shine as guiding stars, leading us on a path to shared comprehension.St. Augustine of Hippo stated that “Peace is the tranquility of order.”This understanding finds echoes in the philosophical depths of Islamic tradition, with Al-Farabi asserting that a truly virtuous society fosters inner peace and common good. Such sagacious teachings offer a foundation upon which we can build a shared future.Now, more than ever, our world stands at a pivotal crossroads. Our Earth, which has cradled civilizations and nurtured cultures, is beset with unprecedented perils. Environmental crises, from escalating climate events to the diminishing diversity of life, issue a pressing call to arms for united action. We have consistently reiterated, “The earth does not belong to us. It is a gift, and we have the moral obligation to respect and preserve it for future generations” (Bartholomew, 2018).As faith leaders and communities, we are uniquely positioned to respond to this call. Our scriptures, traditions, and histories are replete with teachings that emphasize our duty toward the environment. It’s time we plunged deep into these repositories of wisdom to spearhead a collective, faith-based environmental movement.Moreover, dialogue must manifest in concrete actions. Words are but the beginning; the real testament of our commitment will be the projects we initiate, the communities we uplift, and the environment we safeguard. Through initiatives grounded in our shared values, we can inspire transformation on both individual and collective levels.To realize the vision of “One Earth, One Family, One Future,” we must transcend mere tolerance. True dialogue entails deep respect, mutual understanding, and collective action. Our scriptures offer countless narratives that champion unity, respect, and cooperation. By immersing ourselves in these narratives, we can draw inspiration for our common journey.Our Earth, a shared sanctuary, has sheltered countless generations, each adding its own unique chapter to the saga of humanity. Our generation stands at an epochal moment, endowed with the responsibility to chart a course that guarantees peace, prosperity, and ecological balance for those yet to come.As we navigate the challenges of the present, let our actions be guided by the timeless wisdom of our faith traditions. Let this conference be more than a mere congregation of individuals. Let it be a symphony of voices, ideas, and aspirations in order to create a transformative global movement. A movement that, guided by the words of St. Paul, embodies the spirit of “God has called us to peace” (1 Corinthians 7:15).Let us march forth with a renewed sense of purpose, unity, and determination. Let the echoes of our dialogue reverberate through time, inspiring future generations to further strengthen and advance our fellowship. Let this historical city of myriad cultures bear witness to our pledge today: a pledge to work together, shoulder to shoulder, in shaping a world that celebrates diversity, fosters unity, and safeguards our shared Earthlyoikos.May God’s infinite blessings be a guiding light on our path, fortifying our endeavors and filling our hearts with love, compassion, and hope!Works Cited:Bartholomew. “Message for the Day of Prayer for the Protection of Creation.”Ecumenical Patriarchate, 2018.Holy and Great Council of the Orthodox Church. “The Mission of the Orthodox Church in Today’s World.” Crete, 2016.The Holy Bible, English Standard Version (ESV).

Timothy I (AD 780-823) was the Patriarch of the Assyrian Church of the East who made an apology for the Christian faith to the third Abbasid Caliph Mahdi.The brilliance of the Patriarch can be seen from the fact that though he praises Muhammad before the caliph, he made sure to never call him a prophet. Instead, he simply affirmed that Muhammad walked in the path of the prophets. All emphasis will be mineThe Questions and Answers of the Second Day.The next1day I had an audience of his Majesty. Such audiences had constantly taken place previously, sometimes for the affairs of the State, and some other times for the love of wisdom and learning which was burning in the soul of his Majesty. He is a lovable man, and loves also learning when he finds it in other people, and on this account he directed against me the weight of his objections, whenever necessary. After I had paid to him my usual respects as King of Kings, he began to address me and converse with me not in a harsh and haughty tone, since harshness and haughtiness are remote from his soul, but in a sweet and benevolent way.And our King of Kings said to me: “O Catholicos, did you bring a Gospel with you, as 1 had asked you?” — And I replied to his exalted Majesty: “1 have brought one, O our victorious and God-loving King.” — And our victorious Sovereign said to me: “Who gave you this Book?” — And I replied to him: “It is the Word of God that gave us the Gospel, O our God-loving King.” — And our King said: “Was it not written -by four Apostles?”2And I replied to him: “It was written by four Apostles, as our King has said, but not out of their own heads, but out of what they heard and learned from the Word-God. If then the Gospel was written by the Apostles, and if the Apostles simply wrote what they heard and learned from the Word-God, the Gospel has, therefore, been given in reality by the Word-God. Similarly, the Torah was written by Moses, but since Moses heard and learned it from an angel, and the angel heard and learned it from God, we assert that the Torah was given by God and not by Moses.“In the same way also the Muslims say that they have received the Kur’an from Muhammad, but since Muhammad received knowledge and writing from an angel, they, therefore, affirm that the Book that was divulged through him was not Muhammad’s or the angel’s but God’s. So also we Christians believe that although the Gospel was given to us by the Apostles, it was not given as from them but as from God, His Word and His Spirit. Further, the letters and official documents1of your Majesty are written by the hands of scribes and clerks, but they are not said to be those of scribes, but those of your Majesty, and of the Commander of the Faithful.”And our gracious and wise King said to me: “What do you say about Muhammad?” — And I replied to his Majesty: “Muhammad is worthy of all praise, by all reasonable people, O my Sovereign.He walked in the path of the prophets, and trod in the track of the lovers of God. All the prophets taught the doctrine of one God,and since Muhammad taught the doctrine of the unity of God, he walked, therefore, in the path of the prophets. Further, all the prophets drove men away from bad works, and brought them nearer to good works, and since Muhammad drove his people away from bad works and brought them nearer to the good ones,he walked, therefore, in the path of the prophets. Again, all the prophets separated men from idolatry and polytheism, and attached them to God and to His cult, and since Muhammad separated his people from idolatry and polytheism,and attached them to the cult and the knowledge of one God, beside whom there is no other God, it is obvious that he walked in the path of the prophets. Finally Muhammad taught, about God, His Word and His Spirit, and since all the prophets had prophesied about God, His Word and His Spirit,Muhammad walked, therefore, in the path of all the prophets.“Who will not praise, honour and exalt the one who not only fought for God in words, but showed also his zeal for Him in the sword?As Moses did with the Children of Israel when he saw that they had fashioned a golden calf which they worshipped, and killed all of those who were worshipping it,so also Muhammad evinced an ardent zeal towards God, and loved and honoured Him more than his own soul, his people and his relatives. He praised, honoured and exalted those who worshipped God with him, and promised them kingdom, praise and honour from God, both in this world and in the world to come in the Garden.2But those who worshipped idols and not God he fought and opposed, and showed to them the torments of hell and of the fire which is never quenched and in which all evildoers burn eternally.“And what Abraham, that friend and beloved of God, did in turning his face from idols and from his kinsmen, and looking only towards one God and becoming the preacher of one God to other peoples,this also Muhammad did. He turned his face from idols and their worshippers, whether those idols were those of his own kinsmen or of strangers, and he honoured and worshipped only one God. Because of this God honoured him exceedingly and brought low1before his feet two powerful kingdoms which roared in the world like a lion and made the voice of their authority heard in all the earth that is below heaven like thunder, viz: the Kingdom of the Persians and that of the Romans. The former kingdom, that is to say the Kingdom of the Persians, worshipped the creatures instead of the Creator, and the latter,that is to say the Kingdom of the Romans, attributed suffering and death in the flesh to the one who cannot suffer and die in any way and through any process.2He further extended the power of his authority through the Commander of the Faithful and his children from east to west, and from north to south. Who will not praise, O our victorious King, the one whom God has praised, and will not weave a crown of glory and majesty to the one whom God has glorified and exalted?These and similar things I and all God-lovers utter about Muhammad, O my sovereign.”And our King said to me: “You should, therefore, accept the words of the Prophet.” — And I replied to his gracious Majesty: “Which words of his our victorious King believes that I must accept?” — And our King said to me: “That God is one and that there is no other one besides Him.” — And I replied: “This belief in one God, O my Sovereign, I have learned from the Torah, from the Prophets and from the Gospel. I stand by it and shall die in it.” — And our victorious King said to me: “You believe in one God, as you said, but one in three.” — And I answered his sentence: “I do not deny that I believe in one God in three, and three in one, but not in three different Godheads, however, but in the persons of God’s Word and His Spirit. I believe that these three constitute one God, not in their person but in their nature. 1 have shown how in my previous words.”",

He did this three times.Then those who were set to do the burying take the box up on their arms and walk further down. All the rest of them, with the Tasimanes, returned home. As I was sitting there I asked whether anyone could speak both languages that I needed. There was somebody, whom I asked to say TO THE TURKS [Muslims] on my behalf that what they had performed outside there I thought it was good, “for you addressed yourselves to God – to whom else? – for the deceased one. I wanted, however, to know what was that you exclaimed to God?” Tasimanes using the same interpreter said that he would explain: “We asked for forgiveness from God for the deceased, for his own sins committed in his soul.” Retorting myself I said, “Very well, but the judge is merciful, indeed, and dispenses mercy; and he who will come as judge of every race of men, even according to you, is Christ. You must be addressing, therefore, the prayers and the exclamations to Him. Thus you, too, invoke him as God, as we do, who believe that as an inborn Word of His he is indivisible from the Father; for there was no time when God was without reason or without the natural word.” (Source: Saint Gregory Palamas,Littera & Dialexis Patrologia Migne–PG, CL, COL. DCCCVIII)Notice how this great saint argues that the Muslims do indeed believe in the same God, and not different one. He then sets forth to prove that Jesus is indivisible from this God whom the Turks worship since is the Word of the Father. St. Gregory could not argue this way if he actually thought that the Muslim god was different from the God he professed and worshiped.",

I said: Thou art the most aware of it. He then placed HIS PALM between my shoulders, and I felt its coldness in my chest, and I came to know what was in the Heavens and the Earth. He recited: `Thus did we show Ibrahim the kingdom of the Heavens and the Earth, and it was so that he might have certainty.’ (6:75)Darimi reported it in a mursal form, and Tirmidhi also reported.

He then came out hurriedly, and Iqamah for prayer was observed, and he conducted it (prayer) in brief form. When he had concluded the prayer by saying As-salamu alaykum wa Rahmatullah, he called out to us saying: Remain in your places as you were. Then turning to us, he said: I am going to tell you what detained me from you (on account of which I could not join you in the prayer) in the morning. I got up in the night and performed ablution and observed the prayer as had been ordained for me. I dozed in my prayer till I was overcome by (sleep) and lo, I found myself in the presence of my Lord, the Blessed and the Glorious, IN THE BEST FORM. He said: Muhammad! I said: At Thy service, my Lord. He said: What do these highest angels contend about? I said: I do not know. He repeated it thrice. He said: Then I saw Him put HIS PALMS between my shoulder blades till I felt the coldness of HIS FINGERS between the two sides of my chest. Then everything was illuminated for me, and I could recognize everything. He said: Muhammad! I said: At Thy service, my Lord. He said: What do these high angels contend about? I said: In regard to expiations. He said: What are these? I said: Going on foot to join congregational prayers, sitting in the mosques after the prayers, performing ablution well despite difficulties. He again said: Then what do they contend? I said: In regard to the ranks. He said: What are these? I said: Providing of food, speaking gently, observing the prayer when the people are asleep. He again said to me: Beg (Your Lord) and say: O Allah, I beg of Thee (power) to do good deeds, and abandon abominable deeds, to love the poor, that Thou forgive me and show mercy to me and when Thou intendst to put people to trial Thou causes me to die unblemished and I beg of Thee Thy love and the love of one who loves Thee and the love for the deed which brings me near to Thy love. Allah’s Messenger said: It is a truth, so learn it and teach it.Transmitted by Ahmad, Tirmidhi, who said: This is a HASAN SAHIH hadith, and I asked Muhammad ibn Isma’il about this hadith, and he said: It is a SAHIH hadith. (Alim.orghttp://www.alim.org/library/hadith/TIR/245; capital and underline emphasis mine)Here’s another version of the foregoing narrative:Jami` at-TirmidhiChapters on TafsirNarrated Mu’adh bin Jabal:“One morning, the Messenger of Allah was prevented from coming to us for Salat As-Subh, until we were just about to look for the eye of the sun (meaning sunrise). Then he came out quickly, had the Salat prepared for. The Messenger of Allah performed the Salat, and he performed his Salat in a relatively quick manner. When he said the Salam, he called aloud with his voice saying to us: ‘Stay in your rows as you are.’ Then he turned coming near to us, then he said: ‘I am going to narrate to you what kept me from you this morning: I got up during the night, I performed Wudu and prayed as much as I was able to, and I dozed off during my Salat, and fell deep asleep. Then I SAW MY LORD, Blessed and Most High, IN THE BEST OF APPEARANCES. He said: ‘O Muhammad!’ I said: ‘My Lord here I am my Lord!’ He said: ‘What is it that the most exalted group busy themselves with?’ I said: ‘I do not know Lord.’ And He said it three times.” He said: “So I saw Him place HIS PALM between my shoulders, and I sensed the coolness of HIS FINGERTIPS between my breast. Then everything was disclosed for me, and I became aware. So He said: ‘O Muhammad!’ I said: ‘Here I am my Lord!’ He said: ‘What is it that the most exalted group busy themselves with?’ I said: ‘In the acts that atone.’ He said: ‘And what are they?’ I said: ‘The footsteps to the congregation, the gatherings in the Masajid after the Salat, Isbagh Al-Wudu during difficulties.’ He said: ‘Then what else?’ I said: ‘Feeding others, being lenient in speech, and Salat during the night while the people are sleeping.’ He said: ‘Ask.’ I said: ‘O Allah! I ask of you the do of good deeds, avoid the evil deeds, loving the poor, and that You forgive me, and have mercy upon me. And when You have willed Fitnah in the people, then take me without the Fitnah. And I ask You for Your love, the love of whomever You love, and the of the deeds that bring one nearer to Your love.’” The Messenger of Allah said: “Indeed it is true, so study it and learn it.”Grade: Hasan(Darussalam)English reference: Vol. 5, Book 44, Hadith 3235Arabic reference: Book 47, Hadith 3543 (sunnah.comhttps://sunnah.com/urn/642690; capital emphasis mine)This report is also found in another hadith collection:4 Prayer(8c) Chapter: Mosques and places of Prayer – Section 3Mu’adh b. Jabal said: God’s Messenger was detained one morning from observing the prayer with us till the sun had almost appeared over the horizon. He then came cut quickly, and when the iqama had been uttered he conducted the prayer in a shortened form; then when he had given the salutation he called out to us saying, “Keep to your rows as you were.” Then turning to us he said, “I shall tell you what detained me from you this morning. I got up during the night, performed ablution, and prayed what I could; but during my prayer I dozed and was overcome,and there and then I saw my Lord in the most beautiful form. He addressed me by name, and when I replied, ‘At Thy service, my Lord,’ He asked, ‘What do the angels near My presence dispute about?’ and I replied that I did not know. He asked it three times.Then I saw Him put the palm of His hand between my shoulder-blades, so that I experienced the coolness of His fingers between my nipplesso everything became clear to me and I attained knowledge. He then addressed me by name, and when I replied, ‘At Thy service, my Lord,’ He asked, ‘What do the angels near My presence dispute about?’ I replied, ‘Expiation.’ He asked what they were, and I replied, ‘Walking on foot to the congregational prayers, sitting in the mosques after the prayers are over, and performing complete ablution in difficult circumstances. He asked what next they disputed about, and when I said it was about degrees, He asked what they were and I replied, ‘Providing food, speaking gently, and praying at night when people are asleep.’ He then told me to make a request, and I said, ‘O God, I ask Thee for power to do good things and abandon objectionable things, for love towards the poor, that Thou shouldest forgive me and show mercy to me, and that when Thou intendest to test any people Thou wilt take me to Thyself without being led astray. And I ask for Thy love, the love of those who love Thee, and a love of doing things which will bring me near to Thy love.’” Then God’s Messenger said, “It is true, so study it and learn it.”Ahmad and Tirmidhi transmitted it, and Tirmidhi said, “This is ahasansahih tradition.I asked Muhammad b. Isma’il (AL-BUKHARI) about this tradition, and he said it is ASAHIHTRADITION.”Reference: Mishkat al-Masabih 748In-book reference: Book 4, Hadith 176 (sunnah.comhttps://sunnah.com/mishkat:748; emphasis mine)If this weren’t shocking enough, other versions state that Allah appeared as a beautiful beardless young man with short curly hair!“I saw my Lord in the most beautiful form like a youthwith abundant hair.” (al-Daraqutni,Kitab al-Ru’ya, 332-333; 356-357; similar reports from Umm al-Tufayl, Anas b. Malik, Mu’adh b. ‘Afra, Ibn ‘Umar, ‘A’isha, Ibn ‘Abbas; Reported by Tabarani; Ibn Abi ‘Asim; al-Bayhaqi; al-Suyuti; al-Haythami; Ibn ‘Adi, al-Baghdadi)I saw my Lord in the form ofa young man, beardless (amrad) with short curly hair(ja’d) and clothed in a red garment. (Narrated by Ahmad b. Hanbal in Tabarani; AUTHENTICATED BY AHMAD B. HANBAL in Creed 3 citingisnad, ‘Abd al-Samad b. Yahya inTabaqat al-Hanabila, 1:218, al-Marrudhi (d. 888) inTabaqat, 3:81, Ibn ‘Aqil in Makdisi,Ibn ‘Aqil, 130; Ibn ‘Adi al-Qattan,al-Kamil fi du’afa’ al-rijal, 3:49-50, al-Daraqutni,Kitab al-Ru’ya, 332-333, 356-357; al-Tabarani,al-Mu’jam al-Kabir, 25:143; SAHIH BY ABU L-HASAN B. BASHSHAR in Ibn Abi Ya’la,Tabaqat, 2:59; Abu Ya’la,al-Muta’mad, 85; ACCEPTED BY IBN TAYMIYYA inBayan Tablis al-Jahmiyya, 7:192-198, 290)Here’s what one of sunni Islam’s greatest hadith scholars said about the aforementioned report:Ahmad b. Hanbal said about the abovehadith: “Report it because the‘ulamahave reported it.” (‘Abd al-Samad b. Yahya reported inTabaqat al-Hanabila, 1:218)In case the readers are unaware, ibn Hanbal was not only a compiler of hadiths, whose massive collection of narrations is calledMusnad Ahmad, he even has a school of Islamic jurisprudence (madhab) named after him.There’s more:The Prophet saw Allah before deathas is the doctrine of the majority ofAh al-Sunnathus related from al-Nawawi by al-Qari. The evidence for this is the hadith of Ibn ‘Abbas whereby the Prophet said: “I saw my Lord” (ra’aytu rabbi). Ibn Kathir cited it in his commentary on Sura al-Najm and declared its chain sound, but considered it part of the hadith of the dream cited below. Ibn Qayyim [see excerpt below] relates that Imam Ahmad considered such sight to be in the Prophet’s sleep but remains a true sight – as the dreams of Prophets are true – and that some of the Imam’s companions mistakenly attributed to him the position that the Prophet saw his Lord “with the eyes of his head.”Al-Bayhaqi also narrated the hadith “I saw my Lord” inal-Asma’ wa al-SifatWITH A SOUND CHAINbut with the addition: “in the form of a curly-haired, beardless young man wearing a green robe,” a condemned, disauthenticated addition and concatenation with another hadith that refers to Gibril. Hence al-Suyuti interpreted it either as a dream or, quoting his shaykh Ibn al-Humam, as “the veil of form” (hijab al-sura)… (Islamic Doctrines and Beliefs: Volume 1: The Prophets in Barzakh, The Hadith of Isra’ and Mir’aj, The Immense Merits of Al-Sham, The Vision of Allah, Al-Sayyid Muhammad Ibn ‘Alawi al-Maliki, translation and notes by Dr. Gibril Fouad Haddad [As-Sunna Foundation of America 1999], pp. 137-138; bold and capital emphasis mine)In a footnote the translator mentions another narration that says Allah appeared as a man:… and from Umm al-Tufayl by al-Tabarani (6:158 #3385). The latter chain actually states: “I saw my Lord in the best formof a beardless young man” and was rejected by al-Dhahabi inTahdhib al-Mawdua’at(p. 22 #22)… (p. 139, fn. 257; bold emphasis mine)The aforementioned narrations are either assuming that Allah took the form of a man, or that this is his actual uncreated shape or form.Commenting on the anthropomorphic beliefs of ibn Hanbal, Islamic scholar Dr. Wesley Williams noted that:Ibn Hanbal, then, was an anthropomorphist. He affirmed for the divine a human form, including a face, eyes, curly hair, mouth, voice breath, chest and two elbows, back, arms, hands with a palm, five fingers and fingertips, legs, shin, feet, soul, physical beauty, a limit, and even, shockingly, loins. He affirmed the external meaning of these attributes and refused to qualify them withbalkafa. (Williams, “Aspects of the Creed of Ahmad Ibn Hanbal: A study of Anthropomorphism in Early Islamic Discourse,” inInternational Journal of Middle Eastern Studies34 (2002), 441-463)Hence, ibn Hanbal like the so-called Salafi Muslims of today, was an anthropomorphist literalist who held that Allah literally has a body of some kind. This explains why Ibn Hanbal was adamant that Muslims must take the apparent words employed in the Quran and Muhammad’s ahadith, and are to refrain from interpreting them in an allegorical or figurative manner:One should not dispute with anyone, nor engage in formal debate, nor learn the art of argument. Verily,kalamregarding predestination, the sight (of God in the afterlife), the Qur’an, and other topics of the traditions is rejected and forbidden. Whoever does it, even if hiskalamshould agree with the Sunna, is not of the people of the Sunna until he rejects argument and surrenders. Ahmad b. Hanbal (‘Aqida III, in Ibn Abi Ya’la,Tabaqat al-Hanabila, 2:167, ed. Shaykh Ibn Uthaymin)God is over [‘ala] the Throne. The Footstool is at the place of His Two Feet… He moves, speaks, observes, looks, laughs [yadhaku], rejoices, and loves… He descends every night to the lowest heaven however He wills… The servants’ hearts are between two of the Most Merciful’s fingers… He will put His foot in the Fire, causing it to recoil. Ahmad b. Hanbal (‘Aqida I, Ibn Abi Ya’la,Tabaqat, 1:61-62)According to us,Hadithis taken according to its apparent meaning (zahirihi) just as what came from the Prophet. Talking [kalam] about it is an innovation. But we believe in it as it came to its apparent meaning (‘ala zahirihi). Hanbal (‘Aqida III, Ibn Abi Ya’la,Tabaqat, 2:168)As another Muslim authority explained:Thezahirof the wording is what comes first to the mind from that text, irrespective of whether it is literal [haqiqa] or figurative. (Ibn Qudama,Dhamma al-taw’il, 55)So, there you have it folks!Muhammad’s god is a beautiful beardless young pubescent boy with short curly hair who wears a red dress!",

As part of his share the Prophet had chosen Rayhanah, the daughter of Zayd, a Nadirite, who married her to a man of Qurayzah.She was a woman of great beauty and she remained the Prophet’s slave until she died some five years later. At first he put her in the care of his aunt Salma, in whose house Rifa‘ah had already taken refuge. Rayhanah herself was averse to entering Islam, but Rifa‘ah, and his kinsmen of the Bani Hadl spoke to her about the new religion and it was not long before one of the three young converts, Tha‘labah by name, came to the Prophet and told him that Rayhanah had entered Islam, whereupon he greatly rejoiced. When it became clear that she was not pregnant,he went to her and offered to set her free and to make her his wife. But she said: “O Messenger if God, leave me in thy power; that will be easier for me and for thee.” (Martin Lings,Muhammad: His Life Based on the Earliest Sources[Inner Traditions International, Ltd., One Park Street, Rochester, Vermont 05767; 1983], p. 233; emphasis mine)Even the Muslim writings are not able to hide the fact of Muhammad being a vile, immoral, sexual deviant.",

    "full_content": "More of Muhammad’s Inconsistencies –Doing to others what he didn’t want to be done to himIt comes as no surprise to those who have studied the life of Muhammad with any depth that he was someone that was grossly inconsistent since he failed to practice what he preached, and gave himself certain privileges and favors which he withheld from others. Muhammad was also guilty of doing to others what he did not anyone to do to either himself or his followers.For example, when a man came to Muhammad to ask him permission to fornicate, or have sex with women, the latter asked him a series of questions in order to highlight just how perverted and selfish his request truly was:“… Imam Ahmad recorded Abu Umamah saying that a young man came to the Prophet and said, ‘O Messenger of Allah! Give me permission to commitZina(unlawful sex).’ The people surrounded him and rebuked him, saying, ‘Stop! Stop!’ But the Prophet said…<<Come close.>>The young man came to him, and he said…<<Sit down.>>so he sat down. The Prophet said…<<Would you like it (unlawful sex) for your mother?>>He said, ‘No, by Allah, may I be ransomed for you.’ The Prophet said…<<Neither do the people like it for their mothers.>>The Prophet said…<<Would you like it for your daughter?>>He said, ‘No, by Allah, may I be ransomed for you.’ The Prophet said…<<Neither do the people like it for their daughters.>>The Prophet said…<<Would you like it for your sister?>>He said, ‘No, by Allah, may I be ransomed for you.’ The Prophet said…<<Neither do the people like it for their sisters.>>The Prophet said…<<Would you like it for your paternal aunt?>>He said, ‘No, by Allah, O Allah's Messenger! may I be ransomed for you.’ The Prophet said…<<Neither do the people like it for their paternal aunts.>>The Prophet said…<<Would you like it for your maternal aunt?>>He said, ‘No, by Allah, O Allah's Messenger! may I be ransomed for you.’ The Prophet said…<<Neither do the people like it for their maternal aunts.>>Then the Prophet put his hand on him and said…<<O Allah, forgive his sin, purify his heart and guard his chastity.>>After that the young man never paid attention to anything of that nature.” (Tafsir,Q. 17:32)What makes this advice rather troubling is that Muhammad did not practice it himself, nor did his followers, since he permitted them to take women captive and have sex with them, even married ones whose husbands were still alive!Also (prohibited are) women already married,except those whom your right hands possess: Thus hath God ordained (Prohibitions) against you: Except for these, all others are lawful, provided ye seek (them in marriage) with gifts from your property, - desiring chastity, not lust, seeing that ye derive benefit from them, give them their dowers (at least) as prescribed; but if, after a dower is prescribed, agree Mutually (to vary it), there is no blame on you, and God is All-knowing, All-wise. S. 4:24 Y. AliAs shocking as it may sound, this passage is basically stating that the only time a Muslim man (which includes Muhammad) can sleep with a married woman is when she happens to be one of the female slaves that he has taken captive!Unfortunately, this verse was tragically and shamefully put into practice by the jihadists:Abu Sirma said to Abu Sa'id al Khadri: O Abu Sa'id, did you hear Allah's Messenger mentioning al-'azl? He said: Yes, and added: We went out with Allah's Messenger on the expedition to the Bi'l-Mustaliqand took captive some excellent Arab women; and we desired them, for we were suffering from the absence of our wives, (but at the same time) we also desired ransom for them.So we decided to have sexual intercourse with them but by observing 'azl (Withdrawing the male sexual organ before emission of semen to avoid conception).But we said: We are doing an act whereas Allah's Messenger is amongst us; why not ask him? So we asked Allah's Messenger, and he said: It does not matter if you do not do it, for every soul that is to be born up to the Day of Resurrection will be born. (Sahih Muslim, Book 008,Number 3371)Abu Said al-Khudri said: The apostle of Allah sent a military expedition to Awtas on the occasion of the battle of Hunain. They met their enemy and fought with them. They defeated them and took them captives. Some of the Companions of the Apostle of Allahwere reluctant to have intercourse with the female captives in the presence of their husbands who were unbelievers.So Allah, the Exalted, sent down the Quranic verse, ‘And all married women (are forbidden) unto you save those (captives) whom your right hands possess’. That is to say, they are lawful for them when they complete their waiting period. (Sunan Abu Dawud, Volume 2, Number 2150)How unfortunate that Muhammad and his deity did not share the shame and concern of their followers regarding the morality of raping captives whose husbands were still alive, but actually rushed in to compose a text to justify such a wicked and perverted act!This same narration is found in all of the major hadith collections:Chapter 36. What Has Been Related (About A Man) Who Captures A Slave Woman That Has A Husband, Is It Lawful For Him To Have Relations With Her?1132.Abu Sa‘eed Al-Khudri narrated: We got some captives on the day of Awtas, and they had husbands among their people. They mentioned that to the Messenger of Allah,so the following was revealed: And women who are already married, except those whom your right hands possess.(Hasan)(English Translation of Jami‘ At-Tirmidhi, Compiled by Imam Hafiz Abu ‘Eisa Mohammad Ibn ‘Eisa At-Tirmidhi, From Hadith No. 544 to 1204, translated by Abu Khaliyl (USA), ahadith edited and referenced by Hafiz Tahir Zubair ‘Ali Za’i [Darussalam Publishers & Distributors, First Edition: November 2007], Volume 2, p. 502; underline emphasis ours)(3) 3016.Abu Sa‘eed Al-Khudri said: “On the Day of Awtas, we captured some women who had husbands among the idolaters.SO SOME OF THE MEN DISLIKED THAT, so Allah, Most High, revealed: ‘And women already married, except those whom your right hands possess….’”(Sahih)[Abu ‘Eisa said:] This Hadith is Hasan.(4) 3017.Abu Sa‘eed Al-Khudri said: “we captured some women on the Day of Awtas and they had husbands among their people. That was mentioned to the Messenger of Allahso Allah revealed: ‘…And women already married, except those whom your right hands possess….”(Sahih)[Abu ‘Eisa said:] This Hadith is Hasan.This is how it was reported by Ath-Thawri, from ‘Uthman Al-Batti, from Abu Al-Khalil, from Abu Sa‘eed Al-Khudri from the Prophet and it is similar. “From Abu ‘Alqamah” is not in this Hadith and I do not know of anyone who mentioned Abu ‘Alqamah in this Hadith except in what Hammam mentioned from Qatadah. Abu Al-Khalil’s name is Salih bin Abi Mariam. (Jami‘ At-Tirmidhi, Volume 5, From Hadith No. 2606 to 3290, Chapter 4. Regarding SuratAn-Nisa’, pp. 331-332; capital and underline emphasis ours)To make matters worse, Muhammad granted his men permission to marry women for a short period of time for the sole purpose of gratifying their sexual cravings:Narrated Jabir bin ‘Abdullah and Salama bin Al-Akwa': While we were in an army, Allah's Apostle came to us and said, \"You have been allowed to do the Mut’a (marriage), so do it.\" Salama bin Al-Akwa' said: Allah's Apostle's said, \"If a man and a woman agree (to marry temporarily), their marriage should last for three nights, and if they like to continue, they can do so; and if they want to separate, they can do so.\"I do not know whether that was only for us or for all the people in general. Abu Abdullah (Al-Bukhari) said: ‘Ali made it clear that the Prophet said, \"The Mut’a marriage has been cancelled (made unlawful).\" (Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 7, Book 62,Number 52)Narrated Abdullah:We used to participate in the holy battles led by Allah's Apostle and we had nothing (no wives) with us. So we said, \"Shall we get ourselves castrated?\" He forbade us thatand then allowed us to marry women with a temporary contract and recited to us: -- ‘O you who believe! Make not unlawful the good things which Allah has made lawful for you, but commit no transgression.’ (5.87) (Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 7, Book 62,Number 13o)This practice continued to be observed until the time of Umar’s caliphate:Ibn Uraij reported: 'Ati' reported that Jabir b. Abdullah came to perform 'Umra, and we came to his abode, and the people asked him about different things, and then they made a mention of temporary marriage, whereupon he said:Yes, we had been benefiting ourselves by this temporary marriage during the lifetime of the Holy Prophet and during the time of Abu Bakr and ‘Umar. (Sahih Muslim, Book 008,Number 3248)Tragically, there were some instances in which women got pregnant through such unions:Yahya related to me from Malik from Ibn Shihab from Urwa ibn az-Zubayr that Khawla ibn Hakim came to Umar ibn al-Khattab and said, \"Rabia ibn Umayya made a temporary marriage with a woman and she is pregnant by him.\" Umar ibn al-Khattab went out in dismay dragging his cloak, saying, \"This temporary marriage, had I come across it, I would have ordered stoning and done away with it!\" (Malik’s Muwatta, Book 28,Number 28.18.42)Today such a practice would be called prostitution, plain and simple.With the foregoing in view, it is obvious that Muhammad and his followers did to other people’s mothers, wives, daughters, nieces, aunts etc., the very thing that he did not want to be done to the mothers, wives, daughters, nieces, aunts etc. of Muslims.In light of this, we would like to ask the followers of Muhammad the very same questions that their prophet asked the young man.Would the Muslims like it if someone contracted temporary marriage with their mothers? What about with their daughters, sisters, paternal or maternal aunts? How about their grandmothers, granddaughters, female cousins, nieces etc.?Moreover, would the Muslims be okay with a group of invaders coming to their lands and taking their women captive in order to have sex with them? And would they be perfectly all right with such men taking their wives and having sex with them before selling them off to someone else (or even keeping them as their own personal property)?If the Muslims would have a problem with all of this then why do they follow a man who permitted his hordes to basically rape captive women, including married ones whose husbands were still alive? And why would they want to believe in a man who virtually allowed women to be treated like prostitutes by permitting his followers to contract temporary marriages whose only objective was to satisfy the carnal, lustful desires of men who didn’t have the will power to control their sexual urges?The fact is that Muhammad stands condemned by his own teachings and Muslims should therefore abandon such a man and turn to the risen Lord Jesus who is their only hope of salvation and eternal bliss.",

    "full_content": "ALLAH NEVER SAID TO ADAM “I AM GOD, WORSHIP ME”A Debate Challenge to Islamic ApologeticsBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionFor centuries, Islamic polemicists have sought to undermine the divinity of Jesus Christ by demanding Christians produce an explicit verse from the Bible in which Jesus declares in verbatim:“I am God, worship me.”This rhetorical strategy attempts to place the Christian faith under a burden of proof that is not applied consistently to Islam itself. While this approach may appear persuasive at a superficial level, it collapses under the weight of its own logic when mirrored back onto the Qur’an and its theology of Allah’s self-revelation.The central challenge, therefore, is this:If Muslims insist that Jesus must utter in verbatim “I am God, worship me” for His divinity to be valid, then where does Allah ever tell Adam—the first man and prophet in Islam—“I am God, worship me”?The Qur’anic SilenceAccording to Islamic tradition, Adam is not only the first human but also the first prophet. If Allah truly is the God of Adam, the foundational prophet of Islam, then one would reasonably expect the Qur’an to contain a direct, unequivocal declaration where Allah introduces Himself in clear divine self-identification to Adam. Yet upon examining the Qur’an, there existsno single ayah where Allah says to Adam explicitly: “I am God, worship me.”Instead, the Qur’an provides vague references to Allah creating Adam (Qur’an 2:30–34; 7:11–18), breathing into him (Qur’an 15:29), and commanding angels to bow before Adam. But strikingly absent is the explicit divine command of self-revelation to Adam in the form of“I am God, worship me.”This silence raises an academic problem: if Muslims demand verbatim divine self-identification from Jesus as proof of divinity, consistency demands they also produce verbatim divine self-identification from Allah to Adam. Their inability to do so, using their own standard, disqualifies Allah as Adam’s God.The Double Standard of Islamic PolemicsThe Muslim objection to Christ’s divinity often functions on afalse standard of linguistic exactness.By demanding that Christians locate exact wording absent from Scripture, they ignore the overwhelming theological witness of the New Testament in which Jesus claims divine prerogatives:He forgives sins (Mark 2:5–7), a prerogative belonging to God alone.He identifies Himself with Yahweh’s “I AM” (John 8:58).He accepts worship (Matthew 14:33; John 9:38).He declares unity with the Father (John 10:30).The Qur’an, however, offers no parallel clarity for Allah’s self-revelation to Adam. If Jesus’ divinity is denied because the Bible does not contain the precise sentence Muslims demand, then Allah’s claim to deity over Adam must likewise be denied, since the Qur’an never records such a statement.Theological ConsequencesFor Islam:By its own argumentative logic, Islam cannot affirm that Allah is Adam’s God, since Allah never utters to Adam, “I am God, worship me.”For Christianity:The Christian faith rests not on contrived verbatim formulas but on the totality of Christ’s words, deeds, and identity as God Incarnate. The New Testament provides abundant testimony that Jesus is God, without the need for artificial proof-texting.For Debate Consistency:Muslim apologists must abandon their double standard. Either they admit that divine identity can be communicated without a rigid verbatim formula (thus validating Christ’s divinity), or they must accept that Allah fails to qualify as Adam’s God.ConclusionThe polemic that demands Christians show Jesus saying verbatim “I am God, worship me” ultimately backfires on Islam. The Qur’an contains no record of Allah saying to Adam, “I am God, worship me.” By the very standard Muslims apply to deny Christ’s divinity, Allah is disqualified from being the God of Adam.Therefore, the debate challenge stands:If Muslims reject Jesus’ divinity for lack of verbatim phrasing, then where in the Qur’an does Allah introduce Himself to Adam in the same explicit manner?Until such an ayah is produced—which does not exist—Muslim polemics remain inconsistent and self-defeating.ReferencesThe Holy Bible, English Standard Version (ESV).The Qur’an (translations by Pickthall, Yusuf Ali, and Sahih International).Ali, A.

However, when one compares the Qur’an with the Hebrew Bible and Christian Scriptures, a pattern of dissonance emerges. One stark contradiction lies betweenHosea 11:1—where God declares Israel to be His child—andSurah 5:18, where Muhammad, speaking in the name of Allah, rebukes Jews and Christians for claiming to be God’s children. This raises a profound theological question: If Allah is the same God as Yahweh, why would He contradict His own revealed Word? This inconsistency calls into question the reliability of Muhammad’s message, the identity of Allah, and the Qur’an’s claim to divine authorship.God as Father in the Hebrew BibleThe Hebrew Bible presents Yahweh’s covenantal relationship with Israel in parental terms. Hosea 11:1 states:“When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son.”The metaphor of fatherhood conveys divine intimacy, covenantal care, and enduring love. Other Old Testament passages echo this truth:“Is not he your father, who created you, who made you and established you?”(Deuteronomy 32:6).“You are the children of the LORD your God”(Deuteronomy 14:1).“Have we not all one Father? Has not one God created us?”(Malachi 2:10).The fatherhood of God is not merely symbolic but covenantal—establishing Israel’s identity as God’s people. Yahweh Himself uses the language of family, calling Israel “My son, my firstborn” (Exodus 4:22).Muhammad’s Rebuke of God’s FatherhoodThe Qur’an, however, directly repudiates this concept. Surah 5:18 records:“But the Jews and the Christians say, ‘We are the children of Allah and His beloved.’ Say: ‘Why then does He punish you for your sins? Rather, you are humans from among those He created.’”This rebuke dismisses divine fatherhood as illegitimate, reducing God’s relationship with humanity to one of master and servant. Furthermore, the Qur’an categorically denies that God has children in any sense:“It is not befitting for Allah to take a son.”(Surah 19:35).“They say: ‘The Most Merciful has taken a son.’ Exalted is He! Rather, they are honored servants.”(Surah 21:26).By rejecting divine fatherhood, Muhammad’s Allah presents a radically different theology from the God of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Jesus Christ.Theological Implications: Is Allah the God of the Bible?If Allah were truly Yahweh, He would not contradict His own revelation. God’s Word is eternal and unchanging:“The grass withers, the flower fades, but the word of our God will stand forever.”(Isaiah 40:8).“God is not man, that he should lie, or a son of man, that he should change his mind.”(Numbers 23:19).Thus, the contradiction between Hosea 11:1 and Surah 5:18 indicates that Allah is not Yahweh. Instead, Allah emerges as a false deity fabricated within Muhammad’s seventh-century Arabian context. Muhammad, therefore, cannot be regarded as a prophet of the biblical God, since his message fundamentally undermines the covenantal truths revealed in Scripture.Muhammad as a False ProphetThe Bible provides clear criteria for identifying false prophets:Contradiction with Previous Revelation–“If a prophet… says, ‘Let us go after other gods,’ … you shall not listen”(Deuteronomy 13:1–3).Muhammad directed followers toward a god whose nature contradicted Yahweh’s self-revelation.False Testimony of Christ–“Every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist”(1 John 4:3).The Qur’an denies Jesus’ Sonship (Surah 112:3) and crucifixion (Surah 4:157).Self-Glorification– Muhammad claimed to be the “seal of the prophets” (Surah 33:40), elevating himself above all others.These elements identify Muhammad not as a prophet of God, but as a deceiver who distorted biblical truths.The Falsehood of Islam’s Claim: “All Prophets Were Muslims”Islam asserts that Abraham, Moses, David, and Jesus were all Muslims who submitted to Allah. Yet, the scriptural evidence contradicts this:Abraham worshiped Yahweh, not Allah (Genesis 12:7–8).Moses addressed Yahweh as Israel’s Father (Deut. 32:6).David wrote of God as Father and King (Psalm 103:13).Jesus called GodAbba, Father(Mark 14:36), affirming divine fatherhood explicitly.To claim all prophets were Muslims is a historical and theological distortion, designed to appropriate Jewish and Christian heritage while erasing its substance.ConclusionThe contradiction between Hosea 11:1 and Surah 5:18 exposes the theological fault line between the God of Israel and Allah of the Qur’an. Yahweh revealed Himself as Father, yet Muhammad’s Allah denied divine fatherhood. This reveals that Muhammad was not a prophet of the God of Abraham, but a false prophet who misled his followers. Therefore, the Qur’an cannot be trusted as divine revelation, and Islam’s claim that all prophets were Muslims collapses under the weight of biblical truth.The world must recognize that Muhammad’s message stands in opposition to God’s eternal Word, and that salvation is found not in submission to Allah, but in relationship with the Father through His Son, Jesus Christ (John 1:12; John 14:6).ReferencesThe Holy Bible, English Standard Version (ESV).Al-Qur’an, Surah Al-Ma’idah 5:18; Surah Maryam 19:35; Surah Al-Anbiya 21:26; Surah An-Nisa 4:157; Surah Al-Ahzab 33:40; Surah Al-Ikhlas 112:3.Kaiser, Walter C.Toward an Old Testament Theology.

Muslims are taught that Allah is utterly unlike His creation:“There is nothing like unto Him”(Qur’an 42:11). Yet, paradoxically, several Qur’anic verses and Hadith traditions attribute to Allah physical attributes and organs, such as hands (Qur’an 38:75), a face (Qur’an 55:27), eyes (Qur’an 11:37), and even a shin (Qur’an 68:42). This raises a profound theological question: if Allah possesses what is described as a “shin,” how can He simultaneously claim to be wholly unlike human beings, who also possess shins?This article critically examines this contradiction, placing the Qur’anic notion of Allah’s “shin” under scrutiny while contrasting it with classical Islamic theology, Jewish and Christian theological anthropology, and logical-philosophical inquiry.The Qur’anic Description of the “Shin”The critical verse is found inSurah al-Qalam(68:42):“[Remember] the Day when the shin will be uncovered, and they will be invited to prostration but they will not be able.”Classical commentators (e.g., al-Tabari, Ibn Kathir, al-Qurtubi) debated whether the “shin” (sāq) in this passage refers literally to an organ of Allah or metaphorically to a sign of severe distress. Some schools of thought, particularly the Athari and early Hanbali traditions, insisted on affirming the attributebi-lā kayf(“without asking how”), meaning that Allah does indeed have a shin but it is unlike the human shin. Ashʿarī and Māturīdī theologians, however, leaned toward metaphorical interpretations, claiming it was an Arabic idiom for hardship.Yet, regardless of interpretation, the text introduces anthropomorphic imagery, which cannot easily be reconciled with the absolute claim of divine incomparability.The Problem of AnthropomorphismThe central contradiction lies in the following tension:Allah declares absolute dissimilarity from creation(Qur’an 42:11).Allah is described with human organs(hands, eyes, face, shin).Human beings also possess these very organs.If Allah’s shin is literal, then He shares a common attribute with humanity, thereby undermining His transcendence. If it is metaphorical, then why employ anthropomorphic language at all, when such language inevitably leads to confusion, anthropomorphism, and internal contradiction?Christian theology faced similar tensions in Old Testament anthropomorphisms (e.g., “the hand of God”), but these were ultimately resolved in the doctrine of the Incarnation: God took on human form in Jesus Christ while remaining fully divine. Islam, however, denies incarnation while still attributing physical features to Allah. This results in a theological impasse: an anthropomorphic deity who is simultaneously claimed to be beyond all human likeness.Comparative Theological ReflectionJewish Tradition:Rabbinic interpretation often treated anthropomorphic references in the Torah as metaphorical or symbolic, pointing to God’s actions rather than His physical form.Christian Tradition:Anthropomorphisms find their fulfillment in Christ, who is the “image of the invisible God” (Colossians 1:15). Here, divine embodiment is not a contradiction but the core of the Incarnation.Islamic Tradition:Islamic theology vacillates between literalism (bi-lā kayf) and metaphorical reinterpretation (ta’wīl), leaving unresolved the inherent tension between transcendence and anthropomorphism.Philosophical AnalysisFrom a philosophical standpoint, the problem can be framed as follows:Premise 1:Allah claims absolute transcendence and dissimilarity.Premise 2:Allah is described with human-like organs such as a shin.Premise 3:Humans possess shins, hands, and faces.Conclusion:Either Allah is not utterly unlike humans, or the Qur’an introduces contradictory statements.The principle of non-contradiction (Aristotle,Metaphysics, IV.3) demands consistency. If Allah’s shin is literal, He shares features with creation. If figurative, then the Qur’an’s anthropomorphic language appears misleading or incoherent, especially when taken by literalist traditions.ConclusionThe description of Allah as possessing a “shin” epitomizes the anthropomorphic dilemma within Islamic theology. While theologians have attempted to resolve the issue either through metaphorical interpretation or the doctrine ofbi-lā kayf, the contradiction remains: if Allah is unlike humans, why attribute to Him organs that are distinctly human? Christianity resolves this tension through the Incarnation of Jesus Christ, while Islam remains trapped in a paradox between transcendence and anthropomorphism. This inconsistency undermines the Islamic claim of a perfectly coherent doctrine of God.References and BibliographyPrimary SourcesQur’an 42:11, 55:27, 68:42, 11:37, 38:75Sahih al-Bukhari, Sahih Muslim– collections affirming Allah’s physical attributes.Classical TafsirAl-Tabari,Jāmiʿ al-Bayān ʿan Taʾwīl Āy al-Qurʾān.Ibn Kathir,Tafsīr al-Qur’ān al-ʿAẓīm.Al-Qurtubi,Al-Jāmiʿ li-Aḥkām al-Qur’ān.Secondary LiteratureWolfson, H.

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteIntroductionOne of the most contentious issues in Christian-Muslim dialogue concerns the Qur’anic injunctions regarding relations between Muslims and non-Muslims, especially in the context of friendship, loyalty, and trust. Several Qur’anic passages explicitly warn Muslims not to take Christians, Jews, or other non-believers asawliya(friends, protectors, or allies). The exegetical and theological implications of these passages have historically shaped Islamic attitudes towards interfaith relations. This article critically examines these injunctions, their interpretations, and their moral implications, particularly in light of deception (taqiyya) and duplicity, which bear striking resemblance to what Scripture identifies as satanic qualities.Qur’anic Injunctions Against Friendship with Non-MuslimsThe Qur’an repeatedly instructs Muslims to avoid deep bonds of friendship and alliance with non-Muslims. For example:“O you who believe! Do not take the Jews and the Christians as awliya (friends or allies). They are allies of each other. And whoever among you takes them as allies is surely one of them. Indeed, Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.”(Qur’an 5:51).1“Let not the believers take disbelievers as allies instead of the believers. And whoever does that has nothing to do with Allah, unless you guard yourselves against them cautiously (except by way of precaution).”(Qur’an 3:28).2The Arabic termawliyacarries a range of meanings including “friends,” “protectors,” “patrons,” and “allies.” Classical exegetes such as Ibn Kathir emphasize that these verses are prohibitive, warning Muslims against political or emotional loyalty to Jews and Christians, while Al-Tabari underscores that taking them as protectors is tantamount to betraying Islamic faith itself.3The Principle of Deception (Taqiyya)The Qur’an (3:28) introduces a notable clause—“unless you guard yourselves against them cautiously”—which Muslim jurists have interpreted as legitimizing deception under certain circumstances. This doctrine, known astaqiyya, was historically systematized within Shi‘a Islam but also finds application among Sunnis in cases of necessity.4It allows Muslims to conceal their true beliefs or intentions when under threat, or in situations where outward friendship with non-Muslims might serve protective or strategic purposes.5Thus, the Islamic teaching can be summarized as follows:Muslims are forbidden to take non-Muslims as sincere friends.If forced by circumstance, they may outwardly pretend friendliness while inwardly harboring rejection or hostility.This duplicity is considered permissible as a safeguard for faith and community.Such a framework not only discourages genuine interfaith trust but also normalizes suspicion and hidden animosity in religious encounters.The Satanic Characteristics of DeceptionTheologically, this teaching raises profound moral concerns. Christianity identifies deception, lying, and hatred as the very attributes of Satan. Jesus describes Satan as“a liar and the father of lies”(John 8:44).6The Apostle Paul similarly warns that Satan disguises himself as an angel of light, using deception as his primary weapon (2 Corinthians 11:14).7When Muslims are taught to conceal their true intentions, feign friendship, and harbor inward hostility, these behaviors echo what Scripture characterizes as satanic attributes:Deception– Satan deceived Eve in the Garden (Genesis 3:4–5).8Duplicity– Satan masquerades as light while working evil (2 Corinthians 11:14).7Hatred– Satan fosters enmity and discord among humanity (Ephesians 6:12).9The Qur’anic teaching that authorizes deception towards non-Muslims therefore appears ethically and spiritually problematic, aligning with the properties of Satan rather than the God of truth and love revealed in Christ.The Christian ContrastIn contrast, the Christian Scriptures command believers to love all people, including enemies:“But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you”(Matthew 5:44).10The Apostle Paul exhorts Christians to live peaceably with all (Romans 12:18)11and to extend kindness and compassion universally (Ephesians 4:32).12Unlike the Qur’an, which permits hostility hidden beneath pretended friendship, the Bible calls for integrity, transparency, and sincerity in all relationships. True friendship and genuine love are not contingent upon religious identity but flow from the nature of God Himself, who“so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son”(John 3:16).13ConclusionThe Qur’anic prohibition against befriending non-Muslims, coupled with the sanctioning of deception (taqiyya), raises serious ethical and theological concerns. It fosters division, distrust, and enmity, while embodying traits Scripture attributes to Satan—deception, duplicity, and hatred. By contrast, the Gospel of Christ promotes universal love, honesty, and reconciliation. This divergence underscores the incompatibility between the Islamic doctrine of conditional, deceptive friendship and the Christian ethic of genuine love and truth.BibliographyNorman L.

    "full_content": "The Question of Salvation in Islam and ChristianityBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteOne of the most pressing theological issues between Islam and Christianity is the question of salvation and assurance of eternal life. The Qur’an itself acknowledges uncertainty in this matter, even concerning the Prophet Muhammad. InSurah al-Ahqaf(46:9), Muhammad declares:“I am not something original among the messengers, nor do I know what will be done with me or with you. I only follow that which is revealed to me, and I am only a clear warner.”This verse raises a critical point: Muhammad himself confessed ignorance of his ultimate destiny and that of his followers. From a doctrinal standpoint, this suggests that Islam does not guarantee salvation even to its founder, let alone to his adherents.Further, the Qur’an explicitly states inSurah Maryam(19:71):“There is none of you but will come to it [Hell]; this is upon your Lord an inevitability decreed.”Islamic commentators have long debated whether this means that all Muslims will inevitably enter Hell, if only temporarily, before possibly being delivered. Yet the plain text offers no assurance of escape, highlighting a stark contrast with the Christian promise of eternal life.In the New Testament, Jesus Christ declares with absolute authority:“I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me”(John 14:6).Unlike Muhammad’s uncertainty, Christ provides an unambiguous assurance of salvation through His sacrificial death and resurrection. The Apostle John affirms:“These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life”(1 John 5:13).Thus, the Christian Gospel offers not only the possibility but the certainty of eternal life for those who believe in Christ. Islam, by contrast, leaves its followers under the shadow of uncertainty and even warns of an inevitable encounter with Hell.ConclusionThe Qur’an’s admission of Muhammad’s ignorance about salvation (Qur’an 46:9) and its universal warning of Hell for all people (Qur’an 19:71) stand in profound tension with the Christian doctrine of assurance in Christ. While Islam offers no guarantee of paradise, the Gospel of Jesus Christ promises forgiveness, reconciliation with God, and eternal life to all who believe in Him. Therefore, there is no salvation outside of Jesus Christ.📚ReferencesThe Qur’an, Surah al-Ahqaf 46:9; Surah Maryam 19:71.The Holy Bible, John 14:6; 1 John 5:13.Ibn Kathir,Tafsir al-Qur’an al-‘Azim.Al-Tabari,Jami‘ al-Bayan fi Ta’wil al-Qur’an.",

    "full_content": "Why Are 90% (or More) of the Prophets Named in the Qurʾān Jewish Men?An academic, multi-section inquiry with critical questions for Muslim readersBy Dr Maxwell Shimba — Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThe Qurʾān names roughly 25 prophets explicitly; a large majority correspond to figures from the Hebrew Bible (the Torah / Tanakh) and later canonical Jewish and Christian tradition (e.g., Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, David, Solomon, Jonah, Job, Joseph). This article examines that empirical fact, surveys Islamic and Christian/Jewish source material, considers historical and literary explanations, and raises critical questions directed to Muslim theological and historical accounts. The paper concludes by suggesting avenues for further research and offers footnote-style references and a journal-style bibliography.1. Introduction — statement of the problemReaders of the Qurʾān will note that most of the prophets named in its text are the same persons who appear in the Hebrew Bible. If one compiles the names that appear by explicit mention, a canonical count frequently cited in Islamic literature is 25 named prophets (though Islamic tradition also speaks of many thousands of prophets sent to humankind). The striking overlap between Qurʾānic prophet-names and the Hebrew Bible raises academic questions about source-relations, reception, and the Qurʾān’s self-presentation as a continuation or correction of earlier revelation. This paper sets out those facts, outlines possible explanatory frameworks, and formulates pointed, scholarly questions for Muslim interpreters.Riwaya+12. Empirical overview: who the Qurʾān names (selective list)The Qurʾān explicitly names (in its Arabic forms) many figures who are also prominent in Jewish and Christian scriptures: Adam, Noah (Nūḥ), Abraham (Ibrāhīm), Ishmael (Ismāʿīl), Isaac (Isḥāq), Jacob (Yaʿqūb), Joseph (Yūsuf), Moses (Mūsā), Aaron (Hārūn), David (Dāwūd), Solomon (Sulaimān), Job (Ayyūb), Jonah (Yūnus), Elijah (Ilyās), Elisha (Al-Yasaʿ), and Jesus (ʿĪsā), among others. Many Surahs explicitly list groups of prophets together (for example, Qurʾān 4:163 and 6:84 mention Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob and many of their descendants). The count “25 named prophets” is widely repeated in both Muslim devotional literature and academic summaries.Quran.com+2Quran.com+2Load-bearing facts (examples):The Qurʾān names a set of prophets that largely overlaps the Hebrew Bible’s principal figures (e.g., Moses, Abraham, David).Quran.com+1Islamic tradition (exegesis and hadith) also treats the “people of Israel” and their succession of prophets as a primary ancient prophetic locus.Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research+13. Historical and literary context (brief survey)Scholars of early Islam note several relevant points: the Qurʾān addresses communities in late antique Arabia who were already familiar with Jewish and Christian narratives; the Qurʾān self-presents as correcting or restoring what it calls distorted earlier scriptures; and the use of familiar biblical names and episodes functions rhetorically to situate Islam within an Abrahamic line and to make moral/theological points using well-known exemplars. Some recent academic discussions investigate how the Qurʾān engages Jewish and Christian textual materials and oral traditions in late antiquity.Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research+14. Onomastics (names and forms) — Arabic translations of older namesA straightforward observation is that the Qurʾān uses Arabicized forms of Semitic names (e.g., Ibrāhīm ← *Avraham/Abraham; Mūsā ←Moses; Isḥāq ←Isaac). Linguistically and historically this is unsurprising: Arabic and Hebrew/Aramaic are Semitic languages that share many roots and name forms; when a text moves between Semitic languages names are typically adapted phonologically. But the deeper question is not phonology alone — it is why the Qurʾān’s corpus uses a particular roster of named figures rather than naming more local Arabian, African, or Mesopotamian prophetic figures. This demands a historical explanation (see §5).Wikipedia5. Explanatory frameworks (competing hypotheses)Below are plausible scholarly frameworks that can help explain the predominance of Israelite/Jewish-named prophets in the Qurʾān. Each has different theological and historical consequences.A. Continuity hypothesis (Islamic theological claim).Islamic doctrine often asserts prophetic continuity: God sent prophets to every people (Qurʾān 35:24; 16:36) and the Qurʾān presumes many unnamed prophets, but it names those who are paradigmatic for its message. Thus, from an Islamic theological vantage, the Qurʾān’s list emphasizes the Abrahamic line because that lineage is central to the Qurʾān’s teaching. (Qurʾān 21:25; 33:40 discusses Muhammad as the seal of the prophets.)Quran.com+1B. Reception/availability hypothesis.Late antique Arabian audiences were exposed to Jewish and Christian narratives circulating in oral and written form. The Qurʾān selects names and episodes that would have immediate recognition and rhetorical force with such audiences; hence the high overlap. This is a literary-historical account that treats the Qurʾān as reworking existing narrative material.The Bart Ehrman Blog+1C. Canon-formation and selection bias.The Qurʾān is not an encyclopedic list of every prophet in world history; rather, it quotes and names a selection of exemplars suitable to its theological aims (e.g., monotheism, covenant, patience under persecution). Those exemplars happen to be the most prominent figures in the Judeo-Christian scriptural tradition. This is a functional explanation rather than a claim about origins.Quran.comD. Polemical/communicative hypothesis.Some scholars argue the Qurʾān intentionally engages Jewish and Christian scriptures polemically — to assert superiority/correction of what it calls corruptions — and therefore foregrounds the Israelite prophets as subjects of correction, exhortation, or confirmation.Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research+1Each framework yields different critical questions for Muslim theologians and historians. The next section lists such questions.6. Scholarly questions directed to Muslim interpreters (critical, respectful, and evidence-oriented)Selection logic:What theological or historical criteria determined which prophets would be named in the Qurʾān and which would remain unnamed? If prophecy was universal, why are predominantly Israelite figures the Qurʾān’s exemplars? (See Qurʾān 4:163; 6:84.)Quran.com+1Source relationships:To what extent does the Qurʾān depend on, adapt, or correct Jewish and Christian textual or oral traditions available in Arabia? Can Muslim scholarship map specific episodes to identifiable Jewish/Christian sources or oral cycles?The Bart Ehrman BlogOnomastic origins:Given that the Hebrew Bible predates the Qurʾān by many centuries, how should Muslim scholars explain the strictly Hebrew / Israelite provenance of so many prophet-names (beyond the shared Semitic linguistic milieu)? Is the Qurʾān presenting these figures as genuinely the same historical persons, or as analogues?WikipediaGeographical focus:Why does the Qurʾān’s named prophetic roster appear geographically concentrated in the Levant and Mesopotamia rather than, for example, in South Arabia, North Africa, or Persia — regions with their own religious histories? Are there Qurʾānic or hadithic sources that justify this geographical emphasis?Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research+1Tradition-critique:Some Hadith and exegetical traditions speak of many more prophets (e.g., 124,000). How do exegetes reconcile the wide number of prophets with the small set of named figures in the Qurʾān? What are the criteria used in early tafsīr for associating named Qurʾānic figures with biblical characters?Facebook+1Intertextual differences:Where the Qurʾān retells episodes known from the Hebrew Bible, how do the Qurʾānic versions differ in doctrinally significant ways (e.g., Christology, covenantal claims, eschatology)? Can those differences be shown to be innovations, corrections, or independent traditions?The Bart Ehrman Blog+1These questions invite substantive replies from Muslim exegetes and historians and can be the basis of constructive academic exchange.7. Methodology — how this inquiry was assembledThis paper compiled Qurʾānic references (selected verses that group or name prophets), primary hadith references about prophets (representative Sahih collections), comparative biblical citations (selected Genesis/Exodus passages for Abraham and Moses), and modern scholarship about Qurʾān–Biblical intertextuality. The purpose here is not to adjudicate ultimate theological truth claims but to map observable patterns and pose academically defensible questions.The Bart Ehrman Blog+3Quran.com+3AbdurRahman.Org+38. Discussion — implications and a modest conclusionThat most named prophets in the Qurʾān are figures known from Jewish (and Christian) scriptures is an empirically verifiable fact. Explanations range from theological claims of prophetic continuity to historical explanations about the textual environment of late antique Arabia. For critics, this overlap raises questions about source dependence, authorship, and the Qurʾān’s self-presentation as either a restoration of older revelation or as a text that draws upon familiar religious biographies to make new claims. For Muslim apologists, the overlap is typically explained by continuity (the same God sending the same core revelation to Abrahamic figures) and by functional selection (the Qurʾān names those exemplars most relevant to its message). Both sides should engage the historical and philological evidence carefully and respectfully.Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research+19. Suggested further research agendaA philological study comparing the Qurʾānic Arabic forms with Hebrew/Aramaic name variants, exploring transmission paths.A systematic mapping of Qurʾānic episodes to earliest extant Jewish and Christian texts and to known oral traditions.An examination of pre-Islamic Arabian inscriptions and narratives for non-Israelite prophetic traditions to test the geographical-selection hypothesis.A comprehensive review of tafsīr literature to catalogue exegetical rationales for the Qurʾān’s prophet selections.10.

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionIslamic theology affirms that every human being is born a Muslim, naturally disposed to recognize and submit to Allah. This claim is grounded in the Qur’anic doctrine offitrah(innate disposition), a belief that every child is born with an instinctive orientation toward monotheism. Yet this doctrine introduces serious theological and logical difficulties. If all humanity—including Adam—was already born in submission, what then is the need for religion, prophets, and revelation? The following study critically examines the coherence of Islam’sfitrahdoctrine and contrasts it with the biblical doctrine of creation, fall, and redemption.The Fitrah in the Qur’anThe Qur’an teaches that mankind is created in a state of natural submission:“So set your face toward the religion, inclining to truth. [Adhere to] the fitrah of Allah upon which He has created [all] people. No change should there be in the creation of Allah. That is the correct religion, but most of the people do not know”(Qur’an 30:30).¹Here, Islam asserts that submission to Allah is woven into human nature itself. Consequently, Adam is presumed to have been “born Muslim,” not by choice or revelation, but by creation. This implies that divine guidance is already embedded within man’s nature from birth.The Redundancy of Prophets in IslamIf mankind is already born in a state of submission, the question arises: why the need for prophets and scriptures at all? Prophets are traditionally viewed as guides who recall mankind to truth. But if thefitrahis uncorrupted and sufficient, such guidance becomes redundant. On the other hand, if guidance is still required, this implies that thefitrahis inadequate to preserve submission.This paradox undermines Islamic theology:If thefitrahis sufficient, then the Qur’an, prophets, and Muhammad are unnecessary.If thefitrahis insufficient, then the Qur’an contradicts itself by claiming all people are already born in submission.Infants, Judgment, and the Problem of SalvationThe Islamic position leads to further inconsistency. If all infants are born Muslim by default, then they already fulfill the divine requirement without knowledge of Muhammad or the Qur’an. Islamic tradition often holds that children who die before maturity enter Paradise based on theirfitrah.² But this undermines the necessity of Islam’s religious system, since revelation is not required for their salvation.If salvation is attainable without prophetic revelation for infants, why not for all humanity? This exposes a deep theological dilemma: either revelation is essential for salvation, in which case thefitrahdoctrine collapses, or revelation is non-essential, rendering Muhammad and the Qur’an unnecessary.The Biblical View: Creation, Fall, and RedemptionChristianity presents a more coherent account of humanity’s condition. The Bible teaches that Adam was indeed created in fellowship with God but fell into sin through disobedience (Genesis 3). This fall disrupted man’s natural communion with God, introducing death and alienation. Unlike the Islamic doctrine offitrah, the Bible affirms that mankind is not born in unbroken submission but in a fallen state:“Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me”(Psalm 51:5).³ The Apostle Paul echoes this:“Sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all people, because all sinned”(Romans 5:12).⁴Therefore, prophets in Scripture do not merely remind humanity of an innate submission but reveal God’s redemptive plan. This plan culminates in Jesus Christ, who restores mankind to fellowship with God through His death and resurrection (Romans 5:18–19; 1 Corinthians 15:22). Christianity thus explains both the need for revelation and the necessity of salvation in a way that is logically consistent and theologically complete.The Necessity of ChristWhere Islam struggles with the redundancy of prophets under thefitrahdoctrine, Christianity maintains coherence in affirming the necessity of Christ. Humanity is not simply misled but fallen. Thus, a mere reminder is insufficient; restoration requires atonement. Jesus fulfills this role uniquely—performing miracles (John 11:43–44), revealing God perfectly (John 14:9), dying for sin (Hebrews 9:26–28), and rising again (John 11:25). Unlike Muhammad, whose role is limited to instruction, Jesus provides actual redemption.Scholarly ImplicationsThe doctrine offitrahreveals a structural weakness in Islamic apologetics. By claiming that all people are born Muslim, Islam undercuts its own need for prophets and scripture. The Qur’an and Muhammad’s mission become either redundant or contradictory. Christianity, however, avoids this problem by offering a coherent anthropology: man was created good, fell into sin, and requires redemption through Christ. This framework accounts for both the necessity of revelation and the uniqueness of salvation history.From an academic standpoint, this paradox within Islam underscores the superiority of the biblical worldview. Islam attempts to explain the human condition through innate submission, but the reality of sin, moral corruption, and the universal need for redemption point toward the Christian gospel as the only consistent answer. Thus, while Islam’s doctrine offitrahfalters under scrutiny, the Christian narrative demonstrates theological integrity, historical grounding, and salvific necessity.ReferencesQur’an 30:30 (Sahih International translation).Sahih al-Bukhari 1385; Sahih Muslim 2658 — traditions affirming that children of Muslims (and, in some narrations, all children) are admitted into Paradise.Psalm 51:5 (NIV).Romans 5:12 (NIV).

IntroductionThe rise of Islam in the 7th century introduced a new prophetic claim: Muhammad as the “seal of the prophets” and bearer of the final revelation. However, the Qur’an and Hadith preserve accounts that Muhammad not only encountered but also convertedjinns(spiritual beings in Islamic cosmology). This claim presents a theological dilemma when evaluated against the biblical record. In Scripture, God’s prophets never engaged in dialogue with unclean spirits—rather, they consistently cast them out and demonstrated God’s authority over them.The Qur’an’s portrayal of Muhammad as a prophet to both humans and jinn, therefore, raises fundamental questions: Is this consistent with the God of the Bible? Or does it reveal that Muhammad’s experiences originated from a different spiritual source?This paper will critically examine Muhammad’s interaction with jinns, contrast it with biblical revelation, and argue that such encounters undermine the claim of Muhammad’s legitimacy as a prophet of the one true God.2. Understanding the Concept of Jinn in IslamJinn in Pre-Islamic ArabiaBefore Islam, Arabs believed in jinn as invisible beings inhabiting deserts and ruins. They were associated with soothsayers, poets, and occult practices. Muhammad’s contemporaries were familiar with them as spirits capable of possession and mischief.Qur’anic Descriptions of JinnThe Qur’an repeatedly mentions jinns (over 30 times). They are described as created from smokeless fire (Surah 55:15), having free will, and divided into believers and unbelievers (Surah 72:11–15). This dual capacity aligns them closer to humans than to the biblical concept of demons, yet their functions—deception, haunting, and whispering evil (Surah 114:4–6)—parallel the role of demons in Scripture.Jinn in Hadith and TraditionHadith literature affirms Muhammad’s interaction with jinns. Reports narrate how jinns listened to the Qur’an, converted to Islam, and even asked Muhammad for religious instruction (Sahih al-Bukhari 731; Sahih Muslim 450). The famousLaylatul Jinndescribes Muhammad spending an entire night with them.These sources elevate Muhammad not only as prophet of mankind but also of the jinn—earning him the titleMab’uth ila al-Thaqalayn(“Sent to the two heavy creatures: humans and jinn”).3. Biblical Theology of Demons and Unclean SpiritsOld Testament Condemnation of SpiritismThe Torah strictly forbids interaction with spirits:“Do not turn to mediums or necromancers; do not seek them out” (Leviticus 19:31).“There shall not be found among you… one who inquires of the dead, for whoever does these things is an abomination to the Lord” (Deuteronomy 18:10–12).Jesus Christ and Authority Over DemonsJesus’ ministry demonstrated complete authority over demons. He did not negotiate with them but commanded them to leave (Mark 1:25; Luke 8:29). The demons recognized Him as the Son of God but remained under condemnation.Apostolic Ministry and DeliveranceThe apostles followed Christ’s example by casting out spirits in His name (Acts 16:18; Acts 19:11–12). Nowhere do they invite demons into God’s covenant.Key point:In biblical theology, demons are irredeemable, destined for eternal fire (Matthew 25:41). Salvation is for humanity, not for fallen spirits.4. Muhammad’s Interaction with Jinns: Qur’anic AccountsSurah al-Jinn 72:1–2: Jinn hear Qur’an and declare faith.Surah al-Jinn 72:13–14: Some jinn declare themselves Muslims, others deviators.Surah al-Ahqaf 46:29–32: Jinn listen attentively, return to warn their own kind.Tradition further expands:Muhammad taught jinns Islam duringLaylatul Jinn.Companions reportedly saw signs of their encampment.Problem:This places Muhammad in fellowship with spirits rather than exercising authority over them, directly contradicting the biblical pattern.5. Theological Contradictions with the BibleMuhammad’s interaction with jinns creates sharp theological dissonance when compared with biblical revelation.Dialogue vs. ExorcismThe Qur’an describes Muhammad listening to jinns, allowing them to speak, and even affirming their declarations of faith (Surah al-Jinn 72:1–2). Conversely, biblical prophets—especially Jesus Christ—never entertained dialogue with unclean spirits. When demons spoke in the Gospels, Christ silenced them immediately (Mark 1:25; Luke 4:35). The biblical model reveals that allowing spirits to speak is a violation of divine authority. Dialogue is always replaced by exorcism.Question:Why did Muhammad allow spirits to speak freely instead of silencing or casting them out as Christ did?Fellowship vs. Separation from SpiritsThe Qur’an presents jinns as capable of entering fellowship with believers, joining the covenant community, and even evangelizing other jinns (Surah al-Ahqaf 46:29–32). This is in stark contradiction with the biblical command:“Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers… what fellowship has light with darkness? What accord has Christ with Belial?” (2 Corinthians 6:14–15).If Muhammad integrated jinns into his community, then the God behind his message is permitting what the God of the Bible forbids.Question:Why does Islam embrace fellowship with spirits, while Yahweh commands separation?Salvation for Jinn vs. Eternal Judgment of DemonsThe Qur’an depicts some jinns as “Muslims” and recipients of guidance (Surah al-Jinn 72:13–14). Yet, the Bible is clear: demons are eternally condemned. Jesus declares that the lake of fire was prepared “for the devil and his angels” (Matthew 25:41). Revelation 20:10 confirms their final destruction.If Muhammad preached salvation for spirits that God has eternally condemned, then Islam introduces a theological impossibility: redemption for fallen beings beyond redemption.Question:Did Muhammad contradict God’s eternal decree by offering salvation to jinns?6. Questioning the Source of Muhammad’s RevelationThe divergence between Muhammad’s dealings with jinns and biblical theology raises the question:What was the true source of Muhammad’s revelation?Possible Demonic DeceptionPaul warns the Corinthian church:“Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light” (2 Corinthians 11:14).If Satan can disguise himself as an angel, how much more could he disguise himself as “jinns” affirming a false message? Rather than evidence of divine truth, Muhammad’s encounters could be viewed as demonic deception designed to establish a false religion.Question:If Satan deceives through appearances of light, could the so-called “jinns” Muhammad converted have been demons masquerading as believers?The Problem of Contradictory RevelationThe Qur’an claims continuity with the Torah and Gospel (Surah 5:46; Surah 3:3). Yet, it denies the crucifixion (Surah 4:157), rejects the Sonship of Christ (Surah 19:35), and allows fellowship with spirits. These contradictions reveal that the Qur’an cannot come from the same God who authored the earlier Scriptures.Question:How can Allah claim to confirm the Torah and Gospel while simultaneously contradicting their central doctrines?Muhammad’s Early Experiences of “Possession”Historical sources—including Islamic traditions—acknowledge that Muhammad initially feared he was demon-possessed. Sahih al-Bukhari records that he contemplated suicide after his first revelations because he thought he had been afflicted by ajinnor demon (Bukhari 6982). His experiences included convulsions, trembling, and auditory hallucinations—phenomena consistent with spirit possession.Question:If Muhammad himself feared demonic possession at the beginning, should later encounters with jinn be interpreted as divine or as confirmation of his earliest fears?7. Does Allah Equal the God of the Bible?One of the most pressing theological questions raised by Muhammad’s interaction with jinns is the identity ofAllah. Muslims insist that Allah is the same God worshiped by Abraham, Moses, and Jesus. However, the Qur’an’s teachings about Allah diverge so radically from the Bible’s testimony of Yahweh that such a claim cannot withstand scrutiny.7.1 The Incompatibility of Allah’s Nature with YahwehThe God of the Bible reveals Himself as holy, transcendent, and utterly separate from all forms of darkness. He repeatedly warns His people to avoid mediums, necromancers, and interaction with spirits (Deuteronomy 18:10–12; Isaiah 8:19–20). Yahweh cannot contradict His own holiness by later permitting fellowship with spirits (jinns).Allah, however, not only permits such fellowship but also affirms that some jinns can be Muslims and part of his covenant community (Surah al-Jinn 72:11–14). This accommodation of spirits marks a fundamental difference in divine nature: Yahweh rejects, Allah embraces.Critical Question:If Allah embraces jinns while Yahweh condemns all dealings with spirits, how can they be the same God?7.2 Qur’an’s Rejection of Crucifixion and SonshipThe greatest divergence between Allah and Yahweh is found in Christology. The Bible testifies that Jesus is the eternal Son of God, crucified for the sins of the world and raised to life (John 3:16; Romans 10:9; 1 Corinthians 15:3–4). The crucifixion and resurrection are the core of the gospel message.Yet the Qur’an explicitly denies both:Denial of Crucifixion:“They did not kill him, nor crucify him, but it was made to appear so to them” (Surah 4:157).Denial of Sonship:“It is not befitting for Allah to take a son” (Surah 19:35).A god who denies the central act of salvation cannot be equated with the God who provided that salvation.Critical Question:If Allah denies the crucifixion and resurrection, is he not rejecting the very foundation of biblical redemption?7.3 The Qur’an’s Claim to Confirm Previous Scriptures ExaminedThe Qur’an repeatedly claims to affirm the Torah and the Gospel:“He sent down the Torah and the Gospel aforetime as guidance for mankind” (Surah 3:3).“We sent, following in their footsteps, Jesus, son of Mary, confirming the Torah that came before him. We gave him the Gospel, in which was guidance and light” (Surah 5:46).Yet, when measured against these very Scriptures, the Qur’an stands in contradiction. The Torah condemns communication with spirits. The Gospels declare Jesus as the Son of God and affirm His death and resurrection. The Qur’an both permits spirit fellowship and denies the gospel.This inconsistency reveals that the Qur’an’s claim to continuity is false. Rather than confirming, it corrupts.Critical Question:If the Qur’an contradicts the Torah and Gospel on their most essential truths, how can Allah claim to be their author?8. Scholarly Questions on Muhammad’s ProphethoodThe interaction of Muhammad with jinns is not an isolated curiosity; it forces us to reevaluate the authenticity of his entire prophetic claim. When examined through the lens of biblical revelation, the Qur’an, and historical tradition, numerous scholarly questions arise that demand careful consideration.8.1 Why Did Muhammad Interact with Jinns Instead of Casting Them Out?In the Bible, unclean spirits are never considered candidates for redemption but are consistently cast out under God’s authority.Jesus silenced demons and expelled them (Mark 1:25; Luke 8:29).Muhammad, however, invited jinns into dialogue, converted them, and even spent a night teaching them (Laylatul Jinn).Question:If Muhammad were a prophet of the holy God, why did he normalize communion with spirits instead of demonstrating divine authority by casting them out?8.2 Why Does Islam Offer Salvation to Jinns When the Bible Declares Their Doom?The Qur’an teaches that jinns can be Muslims or unbelievers (Surah al-Jinn 72:11–14).The Bible states that demons are bound for eternal judgment (Matthew 25:41; Revelation 20:10).Salvation is a human privilege through Christ’s sacrifice, not an option for fallen angels or demons.Question:Did Muhammad expand the scope of salvation beyond God’s revealed plan, thus contradicting the gospel?8.3 Why Does the Qur’an Contradict the Torah and Gospel?The Qur’an claims to affirm earlier revelations (Surah 5:46).Yet it denies Christ’s crucifixion and sonship, core doctrines of the Gospel.It also undermines the Torah’s prohibitions on spiritism by legitimizing interaction with jinns.Question:How can Muhammad be a prophet of the same God if his message fundamentally contradicts the very Scriptures he claims to confirm?8.4 Why Was Muhammad Initially Convinced He Was Possessed?Early Islamic tradition (Sahih al-Bukhari 6982) records Muhammad’s fear that he was demon-possessed.His experiences of trembling, foaming, and convulsions resemble demonic oppression.Later claims of angelic or jinn encounters only deepened his reliance on spiritual visitations.Question:If Muhammad’s first instinct was that he was demon-possessed, should that testimony not be taken seriously as evidence of the true source of his experiences?8.5 Why Does Muhammad Lack the Prophetic Pattern of the Bible?Prophets of Yahweh consistently called Israel back to covenant faithfulness, affirming God’s holiness and truth.They performed signs in God’s name, vindicating their authority (Exodus 4:30; 1 Kings 18:36–39).Jesus Christ, as the culmination of prophecy, performed undeniable miracles and conquered death.Muhammad performed no verifiable miracles apart from Qur’anic recitation and his reported encounters with spirits.Question:Why does Muhammad’s ministry align more with occult mediums and spiritists than with biblical prophets?8.6 Why Does Muhammad’s Teaching Introduce a Different God?The God of the Bible revealed Himself as Yahweh, covenant-keeper, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.The Qur’an introduces Allah, who denies Sonship, crucifixion, resurrection, and holy separation from spirits.This Allah cannot be equated with Yahweh.Question:If Muhammad’s god rejects the central truths of the Bible, is it not clear that Allah is a different god entirely?8.7 Why Should Muhammad Be Trusted Over the Apostles and Jesus?Jesus and His apostles consistently testified to His death and resurrection (Luke 24:46–48; 1 Corinthians 15:3–8).Their testimony was sealed with martyrdom.Six centuries later, Muhammad contradicted their witness with no corroborating evidence.Question:Why should Muhammad’s solitary claims about Christ and the unseen world override the unanimous testimony of those who walked with Jesus?Section 9: The Beast’s Mark and the Deception of IslamThe Book of Revelation warns that the Beast will causeall people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a markon their right hand or forehead, without which no one can buy or sell (Revelation 13:16–17). This mark is not only economic but spiritual—it represents allegiance to the Beast system in opposition to Christ.When we turn to the Quran and Hadith, we see disturbing parallels. The Quran speaks of a mark upon the wicked:Quran 55:41:“The guilty will be recognized by their marks, and they will be seized by their forelocks and their feet.”This resembles Revelation’s description of visible identification tied to guilt and allegiance.Furthermore, Islamic eschatology introducesthe Beast of the Earth (Dabbat al-Ard)who will emerge and literallymark people:Sunan Ibn Majah 4066: The Beast will appear and “brand the people on their noses.”Jami` at-Tirmidhi 3187: The Beast will stamp believers and unbelievers, distinguishing them for judgment.This stamping or branding is nothing less than aprecursor to the Mark of the Beast.While Revelation presents the Beast’s mark as a satanic counterfeit of God’s seal on His people (Revelation 7:3), Islamic prophecy glorifies the very act of being branded, claiming it as a divine decree. In reality, it inverts the truth: what Revelation condemns as satanic bondage, Islam promotes as divine identification.Another alarming parallel lies in Islamic economic restrictions. Sharia law mandates compliance with Islamic practices—such as prayer, fasting, zakat (almsgiving), and confession of the shahada. Those who refuse to submit are marginalized, fined, or executed in Islamic history. This mirrors Revelation’s warning:no one can buy or sell except the one who bears the mark.Islam already sets up a system where survival is tied to religious allegiance, foreshadowing the Beast’s final system of control.Thus, what the Bible identifies as a mark of eternal damnation, Islam presents as a sign of obedience to Allah. Thiscomplete inversion of good and evilis the very essence of satanic deception. The Beast of Revelation and the Beast of Islam are not separate figures—they are one and the same.Section 10: Islam’s Role in the One World Religion of the AntichristThe Apostle John foresaw a coming global religion in which all nations would worship the Beast:“And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb”(Revelation 13:8). This false worship system, energized by Satan, will unite political, economic, and religious power under one banner. The question is: how does Islam fit into this apocalyptic framework?1. Islam’s Universal ClaimUnlike other religions that remain regional, Islam presents itself as aglobal faith for all people, declaring:“We have not sent you (O Muhammad) except to all mankind”(Quran 34:28). This universal claim mirrors Revelation’s prediction of a religion demanding worldwide allegiance. Islam is not content with coexistence—it seeks domination. Through its missionary zeal (dawah) and militant enforcement (jihad), Islam positions itself as the perfect candidate to merge with or even lead the Beast’s final system.2. Denial of Christ as the Son of GodThedefining doctrine of the Antichristis the denial of the Father and the Son (1 John 2:22). Islam institutionalizes this denial in its very creed. The shahada—“There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is his messenger”—excludes Jesus as Son of God and denies His divine identity. Furthermore, Surah 4:157–158 outright denies the crucifixion, the very foundation of Christian salvation. Thus, Islam already preaches the spirit of Antichrist.3. Preparation for the One-World Submission SystemThe Arabic word“Islam” means submission.Revelation warns that the Beast will require submission through the Mark. Historically, Islam spread by demanding conquered peoples choose between conversion, taxation (jizya), or death. This anticipates the coercive nature of the Antichrist’s system, where worship and loyalty are not optional but mandatory. The Islamic framework of Sharia already demonstrates how religious law can govern every aspect of political, social, and economic life—exactly what Revelation describes under the Beast.4. The False Unity of “Abrahamic Faiths”In our time, we see attempts to merge Islam, Christianity, and Judaism under the banner of “Abrahamic Faiths.” Projects such as theAbrahamic Family Housein Abu Dhabi symbolize the push toward interfaith unification. Yet, this unity is not rooted in Christ but in compromise and denial of His divinity. Islam plays a central role in this movement because it demands recognition of Muhammad and the Quran while rejecting the Gospel. Such efforts foreshadow the false religious system of Revelation 17, where the harlot (false religion) rides the Beast before being consumed by it.5. The Islamic Messiah: al-Mahdi and the AntichristIslamic eschatology anticipates the coming ofal-Mahdi, a global leader who will establish justice, unite nations, and enforce Islamic law. Strikingly, his description parallels the Antichrist of Scripture. The Mahdi will demand allegiance, destroy Christian symbols, and rule from Jerusalem—precisely where Revelation says the Antichrist will set up his throne (2 Thessalonians 2:4). The Islamic Jesus (Isa), who denies His crucifixion and assists the Mahdi, functions as the False Prophet. Together, they replicate the Antichrist-Beast-False Prophet triad of Revelation.Conclusion of Section 10Islam is not merely a religion among many—it is uniquely positioned to play a central role in the Beast’s final world system. By denying Christ, demanding submission, and anticipating a counterfeit messiah, Islam provides both the theological and political framework for theOne World Religion of the Antichrist.Section 11: The Quran as the Counterfeit RevelationThe Book of Revelation is thefinal prophetic disclosureof Jesus Christ, the Alpha and Omega, who unveils the consummation of history and the victory of God over evil. It contains warnings, promises, and a vision of eternal hope. In stark contrast, the Quran presents itself as a “final revelation,” yet it functions as acounterfeit to Revelation, borrowing fragments of biblical truth only to twist them into a narrative that denies Christ’s divinity and glorifies a false messenger.1. Revelation from Christ vs. Revelation from “Allah”Revelation (Bible):Given by Jesus Christ to John through an angel (Revelation 1:1). It exalts Christ as the Lamb slain, the eternal Son of God, and King of kings.Quran (Islam):Claimed to be given by Allah to Muhammad through an angel (Jibril). It denies Christ’s Sonship, rejects His cross, and elevates Muhammad as the “seal of prophets.”This structural similarity is not accidental—it is a satanic imitation. Where Christ’s Revelation ends with eternal worship of the Lamb (Revelation 22:3–5), the Quran ends with eternal servitude to Allah, a false god who cannot save.2. The Lamb vs. the BeastIn Revelation, the central figure is the Lamb of God, slain yet victorious. Worship of the Lamb leads to eternal life. In the Quran, however, the central theme is allegiance to Allah and his messenger. Instead of a Lamb who gives His life for the world, the Quran elevates a messenger who spreads his message by the sword. This contrast reflects the true vs. counterfeit savior: theLamb vs. the Beast.3. The Seal of God vs. The Mark of the BeastRevelation describes a sealing of God’s people on their foreheads (Revelation 7:3). This seal is spiritual, marking believers for divine protection and eternal life. The Quran, however, introduces a physical branding by the Beast (27:82, supported by Hadith), presenting it as a sign from Allah. What Revelation condemns as the Mark of the Beast, Islam calls a divine sign—turning salvation into damnation.4. The Warning Against Altered RevelationThe Bible ends with a stern warning:“If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book”(Revelation 22:18). The Quran, however, arrives600 years laterclaiming to correct, replace, and abrogate the Gospel. By presenting itself as a new scripture, it directly violates Revelation’s warning and places itself under judgment. The Quran is not a continuation—it is a corruption.5. A Tale of Two EternitiesRevelation’s climax:The New Jerusalem, the dwelling of God with redeemed humanity, where there is no more death, sorrow, or pain.Quran’s climax:A paradise of sensual pleasures (virgins, wine, rivers of milk and honey), appealing to earthly lusts rather than heavenly holiness.The sharp difference reveals the counterfeit nature of the Quranic “paradise.” It offers fleshly indulgence, not eternal communion with God.Conclusion of Section 11The Quran stands as thecounterfeit Revelation—a demonic inversion of the true vision given by Christ to John. Where the Bible ends with eternal worship of the Lamb, the Quran ends with eternal denial of Him. Where Revelation promises holiness, the Quran promises indulgence. Where Revelation warns against adding new prophecy, Islam adds a false book. The Quran, therefore, is not the word of God but the twisted counterfeit of the final book of Scripture.Section 12: Muhammad as the False Prophet of RevelationThe Book of Revelation does not only warn of theBeast (Antichrist)but also of theFalse Prophet, who works alongside the Beast to deceive the nations. This False Prophet performs deceptive “signs,” compels worship of the Beast, and promotes allegiance to the Beast’s system (Revelation 13:11–15). When we examine Muhammad’s life and mission, we find disturbing parallels that align him precisely with the role of the False Prophet described in Scripture.1. The False Prophet Promotes the BeastIn Revelation, the False Prophet directs humanity’s worship toward the Beast, enforcing allegiance.In Islam, Muhammad directs all devotion toward Allah—an entity who denies Christ as the Son of God (Quran 4:171, 5:72). By proclaiming a deity who is not the Father of Jesus, Muhammad promoted aBeast-like counterfeit god.2. The False Prophet Speaks “Like a Dragon”Revelation 13:11 describes the False Prophet as having two horns like a lamb but speaking like a dragon. This means he appears gentle and religious outwardly, but his words originate from satanic deception.Muhammad presented himself as a prophet in the line of Abraham, Moses, and Jesus, appearing as a continuation of biblical tradition (“two horns like a lamb”).Yet his message directly contradicts the heart of the Gospel: denying the crucifixion (Quran 4:157), the Sonship of Christ (Quran 112:3), and salvation through grace. Thisvoice of denialis the voice of the dragon.3. The False Prophet Performs Signs of DeceptionRevelation warns that the False Prophet will deceive the world with lying wonders (Revelation 13:14). Muhammad’s so-called “miracles” fit this description:Hisnight journey to heaven (Isra and Mi’raj)lacks historical or rational foundation, yet it is celebrated as proof of divine favor.His encounters withjinn—beings the Bible associates with demons—are presented as moments of revelation and conversion, when in reality they are marks of demonic alliance.The Quran itself is presented as the “greatest miracle,” but its contradictions, borrowings, and denials of biblical truth expose it as a work of deception.4. The False Prophet Enforces Worship and PersecutionRevelation describes the False Prophet enforcing worship of the Beast under penalty of death (Revelation 13:15). Islam historically follows this pattern:Apostasy laws in Sharia demand death for those who leave Islam.Non-Muslims are forced into submission under dhimma contracts, paying jizya or facing death.Entire nations were conquered under the cry of“Allahu Akbar”—not as free worship, but as enforced allegiance to Muhammad’s god.5. The Final Judgment of the False ProphetRevelation 19:20 states:“The beast was captured, and with it the false prophet who in its presence had done the signs by which he deceived those… These two were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur.”This prophetic destiny aligns with Muhammad, who spread deception, denied Christ, and led millions into error. Unless Islam’s followers repent and turn to the true Jesus Christ, both the system of the Beast and the prophet who promoted it face eternal judgment.Conclusion of Section 12When evaluated against the criteria of Revelation, Muhammad emerges not as a prophet of God, but as the very embodiment of theFalse Prophet. He denied the core of the Gospel, promoted allegiance to a counterfeit god, performed lying signs, allied with demons, and enforced submission through violence. In light of Revelation, the case is overwhelming: Muhammad fulfills the role of the False Prophet who serves the Beast, deceiving the nations until the final judgment.Section 13: The Inversion of Christ’s Gospel in IslamThe Apostle Paul warned in Galatians 1:8–9 that even if an angel from heaven preached a different gospel, it must be rejected as accursed. Islam, through Muhammad, presents itself as a continuation and correction of the biblical faith. Yet, when examined carefully, it becomes clear that Islam does not supplement the Gospel of Christ butinverts it—reversing every foundational truth into its opposite. This inversion is not merely doctrinal disagreement; it is asystematic satanic counterfeit.1. The Cross of Christ vs. Denial of the CrossThe Gospel:The crucifixion of Jesus is the central event of salvation. On the cross, Christ bore the sins of the world, reconciling humanity to God (1 Peter 2:24).Islam:The Quran explicitly denies that Jesus was crucified (Quran 4:157–158), claiming instead that it only appeared so. By removing the cross, Islam removes the atonement, leaving mankind without redemption.2. The Sonship of Christ vs. Denial of SonshipThe Gospel:Jesus is the eternal Son of God, begotten of the Father, one with Him in divinity (John 3:16; John 10:30).Islam:The Quran repeatedly denies God having a Son (Quran 112:3, 19:35, 25:2), declaring such belief as blasphemy. This strikes at the very heart of Christianity, for if Christ is not the Son, He cannot be the Savior.3. Grace vs. Works-Based SubmissionThe Gospel:Salvation is by grace through faith, not of works, so that no man may boast (Ephesians 2:8–9).Islam:Entrance to paradise depends on adherence to Islamic law, rituals, and good deeds, with no assurance of salvation except martyrdom. This shifts the focus from God’s finished work in Christ to man’s endless striving under Sharia.4. Resurrection Life vs. Earthly LustsThe Gospel:Eternal life is communion with God, where there is no death, sorrow, or sin. The redeemed are clothed in righteousness and dwell forever in God’s holy presence (Revelation 21:3–4).Islam:Paradise is depicted as sensual indulgence—gardens, rivers of wine, and virgins for sexual gratification (Quran 56:22–24, 78:31–34). Rather than lifting the soul into holiness, Islam’s “heaven” caters to fleshly appetites, inverting the true promise of spiritual renewal.5. Christ the Eternal Word vs. Muhammad the “Final Prophet”The Gospel:Christ is the Alpha and Omega, the final Word of God (John 1:1; Revelation 22:13). No revelation can follow Him because He is God’s full and perfect disclosure.Islam:Muhammad is called the “Seal of the Prophets” (Quran 33:40), superseding Jesus. The Quran claims to replace and correct the Gospel. This is the very fulfillment of Paul’s warning about another gospel delivered by an “angel” (Galatians 1:8).6. Freedom in Christ vs. Bondage in IslamThe Gospel:Christ liberates believers from the law of sin and death, offering freedom in the Spirit (Romans 8:2).Islam:Muslims live under fear—fear of Allah’s wrath, fear of failing rituals, fear of apostasy punishable by death. It is a religion of bondage, not freedom.Conclusion of Section 13Islam is not simply a different perspective on biblical truth; it is amirror image in reverse—a deliberate inversion of the Gospel. It denies the cross, rejects the Son, replaces grace with works, trades resurrection glory for sensual lust, substitutes Muhammad for Christ, and enslaves where Christ frees. This inversion aligns perfectly with satanic strategy: to twist God’s truth into its opposite and lead nations into darkness. Thus, Islam must not be seen as an Abrahamic sibling faith but as theantithesis of the Gospel of Christ.Section 14: The Prophetic Warning Against Islam in ScriptureThe Bible not only proclaims the truth of the Gospel but also forewarns believers about coming deceptions that would oppose Christ. These warnings find clear fulfillment in the rise of Islam, a system that denies Jesus as the Son of God, rejects the cross, and exalts a false prophet. When examined through the lens of prophecy, Islam emerges as one of the greatest fulfillments of biblical warnings against antichrist systems.1. The Spirit of Antichrist (1 John 2:22–23)John writes:“Who is the liar? It is whoever denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a person is the antichrist—denying the Father and the Son. No one who denies the Son has the Father; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also.”Islam explicitly denies Jesus as the Son of God (Quran 4:171, 19:35).By this definition, Islam is not a neutral faith but carries thespirit of antichrist.2. A Different Gospel (Galatians 1:8–9)Paul warns:“If we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let them be under God’s curse.”Islam claims to be revealed by the angel Jibril (Gabriel).Its message contradicts the Gospel by denying the crucifixion and salvation by grace.Thus, Islam falls under Paul’s curse against “another gospel.”3. The Lawless One (2 Thessalonians 2:3–4, 9–10)Paul speaks of theman of lawlessnesswho exalts himself over all that is called God and sets himself up in God’s temple. His coming will be in accordance with Satan’s work, with false signs and wonders.Muhammad exalted himself as the “seal of the prophets” and final messenger, placing his words above Christ’s.His so-called miracles, such as splitting the moon and conversing with jinn, arelying wonders.His law (Sharia) binds millions in oppression, making him a precursor to the lawless system of the Beast.4. The Beast and the False Prophet (Revelation 13, 19:20)Revelation foresees a Beast and a False Prophet who deceive the nations, enforce worship, and receive a mark.The Beast mirrors Islam’s system of enforced submission (Islamitself means submission).The False Prophet aligns with Muhammad, who compelled allegiance to Allah, persecuted dissenters, and spread his message through conquest.The eschatologicalmarkresembles Islamic prophecy about the Beast stamping people, further tying Islam to Revelation’s warnings.5. Warnings About Doctrines of Demons (1 Timothy 4:1)Paul says:“The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons.”Islam originates in Muhammad’s encounters with “revelations” accompanied by convulsions, terror, and voices he feared were demonic.His repeated interactions with jinn (which the Bible identifies as unclean spirits) confirm that Islam’s foundation rests upondoctrines of demons.6. The Rise of a False Peace (Daniel 8:25)Daniel warns of a ruler who will “by peace destroy many.” Islam historically spread by conquest but cloaked itself in the rhetoric of peace (salaam). The promise of peace under Islam is deceptive, for true peace is only found in reconciliation with God through Christ.Conclusion of Section 14Scripture leaves no ambiguity. From John’s warnings about antichrist denial of the Son, to Paul’s condemnation of another gospel, to Revelation’s vision of the False Prophet, the prophetic word consistently points toward systems like Islam. Muhammad’s message fits hand-in-glove with the biblical profile of deception: it denies the Son, proclaims another gospel from an angel, exalts a false prophet, spreads doctrines of demons, and deceives nations under the guise of peace.The Bible did not overlook Islam; it anticipated it. Thus, Christians must recognize Islam not as a parallel path to God, but as aprophetically-foretold counterfeitthat fulfills the warnings of Scripture.Section 15: The Call to Christians in the Face of Islamic DeceptionThe biblical warnings about false prophets, counterfeit gospels, and antichrist systems are not given merely to satisfy theological curiosity. They are given so that the Church maystand firm, discern truth from error, and bear witness to the Gospel of Jesus Christ in a hostile world.In light of Islam’s inversion of the Gospel and fulfillment of prophetic warnings, Christians are called to a threefold response: vigilance, proclamation, and compassion.1. Vigilance in DiscernmentThe Apostle John commands:“Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits, whether they are of God; because many false prophets have gone out into the world”(1 John 4:1). Christians must recognize Islam for what it is—a religion founded upon denial of Christ’s divinity and the corruption of the Gospel. To treat it as a parallel path to God is to ignore the clear testimony of Scripture. Discernment requires courage to call Islam what the Bible calls it: antichrist.2. Boldness in ProclamationThe Apostle Paul declared:“I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes”(Romans 1:16). The only remedy for deception is the truth of Christ crucified and risen. Christians are therefore called to boldly proclaim Jesus as the eternal Son of God, the only Savior, and the final revelation of God. This proclamation must not be watered down to accommodate interfaith harmony but must confront the lie with the truth.3. Compassion for the DeceivedWhile Islam is a system of deception, Muslims themselves are not the enemy—they are captives in need of deliverance. Paul writes:“The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel”(2 Corinthians 4:4). The Church must therefore engage Muslims not with hatred but with the compassion of Christ, praying for their eyes to be opened and their hearts to be freed. Evangelism to Muslims must be coupled with love, patience, and unwavering conviction that only Jesus saves.4. Perseverance in Spiritual WarfarePaul reminds believers:“We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places”(Ephesians 6:12). The rise of Islam is not merely historical or cultural—it is spiritual. Christians must equip themselves with the armor of God, stand firm in prayer, and resist compromise with false religion.Conclusion of Section 15In the face of Islamic deception, Christians are not called to fear but to faithfulness. We must discern the truth of Scripture, proclaim the Gospel with boldness, show compassion to Muslims trapped in error, and persevere in spiritual warfare. Revelation ends with the victory of the Lamb and those who follow Him:“They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony”(Revelation 12:11).The call to the Church is clear: hold fast to Christ, reject counterfeit gospels, and bear witness to the only Savior who is the Way, the Truth, and the Life (John 14:6). In doing so, we expose the lie of Islam and magnify the eternal glory of the Lamb who reigns forever.Conclusion and SummaryThis study has systematically examined Islam through the lens of biblical prophecy, apocalyptic literature, and theological discernment, revealing Islam not as a continuation of divine revelation but as a counterfeit system aligned with end-time deception. Across fifteen sections, we have traced the interconnection between Islamic claims and the eschatological warnings given in the Holy Scriptures, concluding that Islam fulfills the prophetic profile of the Beast system, the false prophet, and the great deception foretold in Revelation and the Pauline epistles.Summary of Key ArgumentsIntroduction to Revelation 13 and Islamic ParallelsRevelation 13 warns of a Beast rising with deceptive power and authority, demanding allegiance through false miracles and blasphemous claims. When read in parallel with Islamic eschatology, particularly in the Qur’an and Hadith traditions, striking similarities emerge.The Beast, the False Witness, and the Mark of IslamIslam introduces concepts of a “Beast from the Earth” (Qur’an 27:82–83), a false witness against humanity (Qur’an 16:84–85), and a mark of allegiance (Qur’an 55:41), directly paralleling Revelation 13:11–18. These connections demonstrate that Islam’s eschatology mirrors, yet distorts, biblical prophecy.The False Prophet in Islamic TextsThe Qur’an and Hadith portray a future eschatological figure, particularly ‘Isa (Islamic Jesus), who denies the crucifixion and divinity of Christ. This “prophet” proclaims an anti-gospel, aligning closely with the False Prophet of Revelation who points the nations away from Christ.The Antichrist System and Islamic TheologyJohn describes Antichrist as one who denies the Father and the Son (1 John 2:22). Islam categorically denies Jesus’ Sonship and the Trinity, placing it firmly within the biblical definition of antichrist.The Mark of the Beast and Islamic SymbolsThe profession of the Shahada, enforced submission, and eschatological allegiance to the Mahdi and Islamic Jesus serve as equivalents to the “mark” in Revelation 13—symbols of ultimate loyalty to a counterfeit god.Islam’s Reversal of Biblical ProphecyIslamic eschatology consistently inverts biblical truths: Christ the returning King becomes subordinate to the Mahdi, the Antichrist becomes the Christian Messiah, and the cross is replaced by denial of crucifixion. This inversion demonstrates satanic mimicry.The Global Dominion of IslamRevelation describes a Beast exercising global dominion. Islam’s long-standing claim of universal submission under sharia, coupled with its expansionist eschatology, mirrors the apocalyptic vision of a religious-political empire seeking world domination.The Deceptive Power of Islamic RevelationMuhammad’s “revelations” bear the marks of deception—ecstatic seizures, contradictory teachings, and denial of Christ’s divinity. This corresponds with Paul’s warning in Galatians 1:8 of a “different gospel” delivered by an angelic messenger.The Role of the Dragon in Empowering IslamRevelation 13 emphasizes the Dragon (Satan) giving power to the Beast. Islam’s denial of Christ and violent enforcement of submission reveal the fingerprints of the Dragon, whose mission is to deceive the nations.The Quran as the Counterfeit ScriptureThe Qur’an positions itself as a “final revelation” while simultaneously undermining the Torah and Gospel. This fulfills the pattern of counterfeit scripture, imitating the form of divine revelation but stripping it of redemptive truth.Muhammad as the False Prophet of RevelationMuhammad fits the biblical profile of the False Prophet: he led people into idolatry of a false god (Allah), rejected Christ’s crucifixion, and validated his authority through coercion and false miracles.The Inversion of Christ’s Gospel in IslamWhere Christ proclaims salvation by grace through His death and resurrection, Islam offers salvation through works, law, and denial of the cross. This inversion is the hallmark of an antichrist gospel.Prophetic Warnings Against Islam in ScriptureThe Bible repeatedly warns of deceivers, false prophets, and systems that exalt themselves against the knowledge of Christ (2 Thessalonians 2; Matthew 24). Islam embodies these warnings, providing a living fulfillment of biblical prophecy.The Christian Response in the Face of Islamic DeceptionBelievers are called not to fear but to stand firm in truth, armed with discernment and the gospel of Jesus Christ. The call is to evangelize Muslims with love while rejecting the falsehood of Islam as a satanic counterfeit.Final ConclusionThe cumulative evidence demonstrates that Islam is not merely another world religion but a prophetically significant system of deception. It parallels the warnings of Revelation 13, mirrors the characteristics of the Beast and False Prophet, and actively denies the central truth of Christianity—the death, resurrection, and divinity of Jesus Christ. As such, Islam represents one of the clearest fulfillments of biblical prophecy concerning the end-time deception.Christians, therefore, must remain vigilant, discerning, and unwavering in the truth of the gospel. The Lamb who was slain is the true Redeemer, and no counterfeit system can prevail against His eternal kingdom. Revelation assures believers of Christ’s ultimate victory: the Beast, the False Prophet, and the Dragon will be cast into the lake of fire (Revelation 20:10). Our confidence rests not in fear of Islam but in the sovereignty of Christ, who has overcome the world.",

IntroductionThe rise of Islam in the 7th century introduced a new prophetic claim: Muhammad as the “seal of the prophets” and bearer of the final revelation. However, the Qur’an and Hadith preserve accounts that Muhammad not only encountered but also convertedjinns(spiritual beings in Islamic cosmology). This claim presents a theological dilemma when evaluated against the biblical record. In Scripture, God’s prophets never engaged in dialogue with unclean spirits—rather, they consistently cast them out and demonstrated God’s authority over them.The Qur’an’s portrayal of Muhammad as a prophet to both humans and jinn, therefore, raises fundamental questions: Is this consistent with the God of the Bible? Or does it reveal that Muhammad’s experiences originated from a different spiritual source?This paper will critically examine Muhammad’s interaction with jinns, contrast it with biblical revelation, and argue that such encounters undermine the claim of Muhammad’s legitimacy as a prophet of the one true God.2. Understanding the Concept of Jinn in IslamJinn in Pre-Islamic ArabiaBefore Islam, Arabs believed in jinn as invisible beings inhabiting deserts and ruins. They were associated with soothsayers, poets, and occult practices. Muhammad’s contemporaries were familiar with them as spirits capable of possession and mischief.Qur’anic Descriptions of JinnThe Qur’an repeatedly mentions jinns (over 30 times). They are described as created from smokeless fire (Surah 55:15), having free will, and divided into believers and unbelievers (Surah 72:11–15). This dual capacity aligns them closer to humans than to the biblical concept of demons, yet their functions—deception, haunting, and whispering evil (Surah 114:4–6)—parallel the role of demons in Scripture.Jinn in Hadith and TraditionHadith literature affirms Muhammad’s interaction with jinns. Reports narrate how jinns listened to the Qur’an, converted to Islam, and even asked Muhammad for religious instruction (Sahih al-Bukhari 731; Sahih Muslim 450). The famousLaylatul Jinndescribes Muhammad spending an entire night with them.These sources elevate Muhammad not only as prophet of mankind but also of the jinn—earning him the titleMab’uth ila al-Thaqalayn(“Sent to the two heavy creatures: humans and jinn”).3. Biblical Theology of Demons and Unclean SpiritsOld Testament Condemnation of SpiritismThe Torah strictly forbids interaction with spirits:“Do not turn to mediums or necromancers; do not seek them out” (Leviticus 19:31).“There shall not be found among you… one who inquires of the dead, for whoever does these things is an abomination to the Lord” (Deuteronomy 18:10–12).Jesus Christ and Authority Over DemonsJesus’ ministry demonstrated complete authority over demons. He did not negotiate with them but commanded them to leave (Mark 1:25; Luke 8:29). The demons recognized Him as the Son of God but remained under condemnation.Apostolic Ministry and DeliveranceThe apostles followed Christ’s example by casting out spirits in His name (Acts 16:18; Acts 19:11–12). Nowhere do they invite demons into God’s covenant.Key point:In biblical theology, demons are irredeemable, destined for eternal fire (Matthew 25:41). Salvation is for humanity, not for fallen spirits.4. Muhammad’s Interaction with Jinns: Qur’anic AccountsSurah al-Jinn 72:1–2: Jinn hear Qur’an and declare faith.Surah al-Jinn 72:13–14: Some jinn declare themselves Muslims, others deviators.Surah al-Ahqaf 46:29–32: Jinn listen attentively, return to warn their own kind.Tradition further expands:Muhammad taught jinns Islam duringLaylatul Jinn.Companions reportedly saw signs of their encampment.Problem:This places Muhammad in fellowship with spirits rather than exercising authority over them, directly contradicting the biblical pattern.5. Theological Contradictions with the BibleMuhammad’s interaction with jinns creates sharp theological dissonance when compared with biblical revelation.Dialogue vs. ExorcismThe Qur’an describes Muhammad listening to jinns, allowing them to speak, and even affirming their declarations of faith (Surah al-Jinn 72:1–2). Conversely, biblical prophets—especially Jesus Christ—never entertained dialogue with unclean spirits. When demons spoke in the Gospels, Christ silenced them immediately (Mark 1:25; Luke 4:35). The biblical model reveals that allowing spirits to speak is a violation of divine authority. Dialogue is always replaced by exorcism.Question:Why did Muhammad allow spirits to speak freely instead of silencing or casting them out as Christ did?Fellowship vs. Separation from SpiritsThe Qur’an presents jinns as capable of entering fellowship with believers, joining the covenant community, and even evangelizing other jinns (Surah al-Ahqaf 46:29–32). This is in stark contradiction with the biblical command:“Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers… what fellowship has light with darkness? What accord has Christ with Belial?” (2 Corinthians 6:14–15).If Muhammad integrated jinns into his community, then the God behind his message is permitting what the God of the Bible forbids.Question:Why does Islam embrace fellowship with spirits, while Yahweh commands separation?Salvation for Jinn vs. Eternal Judgment of DemonsThe Qur’an depicts some jinns as “Muslims” and recipients of guidance (Surah al-Jinn 72:13–14). Yet, the Bible is clear: demons are eternally condemned. Jesus declares that the lake of fire was prepared “for the devil and his angels” (Matthew 25:41). Revelation 20:10 confirms their final destruction.If Muhammad preached salvation for spirits that God has eternally condemned, then Islam introduces a theological impossibility: redemption for fallen beings beyond redemption.Question:Did Muhammad contradict God’s eternal decree by offering salvation to jinns?6. Questioning the Source of Muhammad’s RevelationThe divergence between Muhammad’s dealings with jinns and biblical theology raises the question:What was the true source of Muhammad’s revelation?Possible Demonic DeceptionPaul warns the Corinthian church:“Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light” (2 Corinthians 11:14).If Satan can disguise himself as an angel, how much more could he disguise himself as “jinns” affirming a false message? Rather than evidence of divine truth, Muhammad’s encounters could be viewed as demonic deception designed to establish a false religion.Question:If Satan deceives through appearances of light, could the so-called “jinns” Muhammad converted have been demons masquerading as believers?The Problem of Contradictory RevelationThe Qur’an claims continuity with the Torah and Gospel (Surah 5:46; Surah 3:3). Yet, it denies the crucifixion (Surah 4:157), rejects the Sonship of Christ (Surah 19:35), and allows fellowship with spirits. These contradictions reveal that the Qur’an cannot come from the same God who authored the earlier Scriptures.Question:How can Allah claim to confirm the Torah and Gospel while simultaneously contradicting their central doctrines?Muhammad’s Early Experiences of “Possession”Historical sources—including Islamic traditions—acknowledge that Muhammad initially feared he was demon-possessed. Sahih al-Bukhari records that he contemplated suicide after his first revelations because he thought he had been afflicted by ajinnor demon (Bukhari 6982). His experiences included convulsions, trembling, and auditory hallucinations—phenomena consistent with spirit possession.Question:If Muhammad himself feared demonic possession at the beginning, should later encounters with jinn be interpreted as divine or as confirmation of his earliest fears?7. Does Allah Equal the God of the Bible?One of the most pressing theological questions raised by Muhammad’s interaction with jinns is the identity ofAllah. Muslims insist that Allah is the same God worshiped by Abraham, Moses, and Jesus. However, the Qur’an’s teachings about Allah diverge so radically from the Bible’s testimony of Yahweh that such a claim cannot withstand scrutiny.7.1 The Incompatibility of Allah’s Nature with YahwehThe God of the Bible reveals Himself as holy, transcendent, and utterly separate from all forms of darkness. He repeatedly warns His people to avoid mediums, necromancers, and interaction with spirits (Deuteronomy 18:10–12; Isaiah 8:19–20). Yahweh cannot contradict His own holiness by later permitting fellowship with spirits (jinns).Allah, however, not only permits such fellowship but also affirms that some jinns can be Muslims and part of his covenant community (Surah al-Jinn 72:11–14). This accommodation of spirits marks a fundamental difference in divine nature: Yahweh rejects, Allah embraces.Critical Question:If Allah embraces jinns while Yahweh condemns all dealings with spirits, how can they be the same God?7.2 Qur’an’s Rejection of Crucifixion and SonshipThe greatest divergence between Allah and Yahweh is found in Christology. The Bible testifies that Jesus is the eternal Son of God, crucified for the sins of the world and raised to life (John 3:16; Romans 10:9; 1 Corinthians 15:3–4). The crucifixion and resurrection are the core of the gospel message.Yet the Qur’an explicitly denies both:Denial of Crucifixion:“They did not kill him, nor crucify him, but it was made to appear so to them” (Surah 4:157).Denial of Sonship:“It is not befitting for Allah to take a son” (Surah 19:35).A god who denies the central act of salvation cannot be equated with the God who provided that salvation.Critical Question:If Allah denies the crucifixion and resurrection, is he not rejecting the very foundation of biblical redemption?7.3 The Qur’an’s Claim to Confirm Previous Scriptures ExaminedThe Qur’an repeatedly claims to affirm the Torah and the Gospel:“He sent down the Torah and the Gospel aforetime as guidance for mankind” (Surah 3:3).“We sent, following in their footsteps, Jesus, son of Mary, confirming the Torah that came before him. We gave him the Gospel, in which was guidance and light” (Surah 5:46).Yet, when measured against these very Scriptures, the Qur’an stands in contradiction. The Torah condemns communication with spirits. The Gospels declare Jesus as the Son of God and affirm His death and resurrection. The Qur’an both permits spirit fellowship and denies the gospel.This inconsistency reveals that the Qur’an’s claim to continuity is false. Rather than confirming, it corrupts.Critical Question:If the Qur’an contradicts the Torah and Gospel on their most essential truths, how can Allah claim to be their author?8. Scholarly Questions on Muhammad’s ProphethoodThe interaction of Muhammad with jinns is not an isolated curiosity; it forces us to reevaluate the authenticity of his entire prophetic claim. When examined through the lens of biblical revelation, the Qur’an, and historical tradition, numerous scholarly questions arise that demand careful consideration.8.1 Why Did Muhammad Interact with Jinns Instead of Casting Them Out?In the Bible, unclean spirits are never considered candidates for redemption but are consistently cast out under God’s authority.Jesus silenced demons and expelled them (Mark 1:25; Luke 8:29).Muhammad, however, invited jinns into dialogue, converted them, and even spent a night teaching them (Laylatul Jinn).Question:If Muhammad were a prophet of the holy God, why did he normalize communion with spirits instead of demonstrating divine authority by casting them out?8.2 Why Does Islam Offer Salvation to Jinns When the Bible Declares Their Doom?The Qur’an teaches that jinns can be Muslims or unbelievers (Surah al-Jinn 72:11–14).The Bible states that demons are bound for eternal judgment (Matthew 25:41; Revelation 20:10).Salvation is a human privilege through Christ’s sacrifice, not an option for fallen angels or demons.Question:Did Muhammad expand the scope of salvation beyond God’s revealed plan, thus contradicting the gospel?8.3 Why Does the Qur’an Contradict the Torah and Gospel?The Qur’an claims to affirm earlier revelations (Surah 5:46).Yet it denies Christ’s crucifixion and sonship, core doctrines of the Gospel.It also undermines the Torah’s prohibitions on spiritism by legitimizing interaction with jinns.Question:How can Muhammad be a prophet of the same God if his message fundamentally contradicts the very Scriptures he claims to confirm?8.4 Why Was Muhammad Initially Convinced He Was Possessed?Early Islamic tradition (Sahih al-Bukhari 6982) records Muhammad’s fear that he was demon-possessed.His experiences of trembling, foaming, and convulsions resemble demonic oppression.Later claims of angelic or jinn encounters only deepened his reliance on spiritual visitations.Question:If Muhammad’s first instinct was that he was demon-possessed, should that testimony not be taken seriously as evidence of the true source of his experiences?8.5 Why Does Muhammad Lack the Prophetic Pattern of the Bible?Prophets of Yahweh consistently called Israel back to covenant faithfulness, affirming God’s holiness and truth.They performed signs in God’s name, vindicating their authority (Exodus 4:30; 1 Kings 18:36–39).Jesus Christ, as the culmination of prophecy, performed undeniable miracles and conquered death.Muhammad performed no verifiable miracles apart from Qur’anic recitation and his reported encounters with spirits.Question:Why does Muhammad’s ministry align more with occult mediums and spiritists than with biblical prophets?8.6 Why Does Muhammad’s Teaching Introduce a Different God?The God of the Bible revealed Himself as Yahweh, covenant-keeper, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.The Qur’an introduces Allah, who denies Sonship, crucifixion, resurrection, and holy separation from spirits.This Allah cannot be equated with Yahweh.Question:If Muhammad’s god rejects the central truths of the Bible, is it not clear that Allah is a different god entirely?8.7 Why Should Muhammad Be Trusted Over the Apostles and Jesus?Jesus and His apostles consistently testified to His death and resurrection (Luke 24:46–48; 1 Corinthians 15:3–8).Their testimony was sealed with martyrdom.Six centuries later, Muhammad contradicted their witness with no corroborating evidence.Question:Why should Muhammad’s solitary claims about Christ and the unseen world override the unanimous testimony of those who walked with Jesus?Section 9: The Beast’s Mark and the Deception of IslamThe Book of Revelation warns that the Beast will causeall people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a markon their right hand or forehead, without which no one can buy or sell (Revelation 13:16–17). This mark is not only economic but spiritual—it represents allegiance to the Beast system in opposition to Christ.When we turn to the Quran and Hadith, we see disturbing parallels. The Quran speaks of a mark upon the wicked:Quran 55:41:“The guilty will be recognized by their marks, and they will be seized by their forelocks and their feet.”This resembles Revelation’s description of visible identification tied to guilt and allegiance.Furthermore, Islamic eschatology introducesthe Beast of the Earth (Dabbat al-Ard)who will emerge and literallymark people:Sunan Ibn Majah 4066: The Beast will appear and “brand the people on their noses.”Jami` at-Tirmidhi 3187: The Beast will stamp believers and unbelievers, distinguishing them for judgment.This stamping or branding is nothing less than aprecursor to the Mark of the Beast.While Revelation presents the Beast’s mark as a satanic counterfeit of God’s seal on His people (Revelation 7:3), Islamic prophecy glorifies the very act of being branded, claiming it as a divine decree. In reality, it inverts the truth: what Revelation condemns as satanic bondage, Islam promotes as divine identification.Another alarming parallel lies in Islamic economic restrictions. Sharia law mandates compliance with Islamic practices—such as prayer, fasting, zakat (almsgiving), and confession of the shahada. Those who refuse to submit are marginalized, fined, or executed in Islamic history. This mirrors Revelation’s warning:no one can buy or sell except the one who bears the mark.Islam already sets up a system where survival is tied to religious allegiance, foreshadowing the Beast’s final system of control.Thus, what the Bible identifies as a mark of eternal damnation, Islam presents as a sign of obedience to Allah. Thiscomplete inversion of good and evilis the very essence of satanic deception. The Beast of Revelation and the Beast of Islam are not separate figures—they are one and the same.Section 10: Islam’s Role in the One World Religion of the AntichristThe Apostle John foresaw a coming global religion in which all nations would worship the Beast:“And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb”(Revelation 13:8). This false worship system, energized by Satan, will unite political, economic, and religious power under one banner. The question is: how does Islam fit into this apocalyptic framework?1. Islam’s Universal ClaimUnlike other religions that remain regional, Islam presents itself as aglobal faith for all people, declaring:“We have not sent you (O Muhammad) except to all mankind”(Quran 34:28). This universal claim mirrors Revelation’s prediction of a religion demanding worldwide allegiance. Islam is not content with coexistence—it seeks domination. Through its missionary zeal (dawah) and militant enforcement (jihad), Islam positions itself as the perfect candidate to merge with or even lead the Beast’s final system.2. Denial of Christ as the Son of GodThedefining doctrine of the Antichristis the denial of the Father and the Son (1 John 2:22). Islam institutionalizes this denial in its very creed. The shahada—“There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is his messenger”—excludes Jesus as Son of God and denies His divine identity. Furthermore, Surah 4:157–158 outright denies the crucifixion, the very foundation of Christian salvation. Thus, Islam already preaches the spirit of Antichrist.3. Preparation for the One-World Submission SystemThe Arabic word“Islam” means submission.Revelation warns that the Beast will require submission through the Mark. Historically, Islam spread by demanding conquered peoples choose between conversion, taxation (jizya), or death. This anticipates the coercive nature of the Antichrist’s system, where worship and loyalty are not optional but mandatory. The Islamic framework of Sharia already demonstrates how religious law can govern every aspect of political, social, and economic life—exactly what Revelation describes under the Beast.4. The False Unity of “Abrahamic Faiths”In our time, we see attempts to merge Islam, Christianity, and Judaism under the banner of “Abrahamic Faiths.” Projects such as theAbrahamic Family Housein Abu Dhabi symbolize the push toward interfaith unification. Yet, this unity is not rooted in Christ but in compromise and denial of His divinity. Islam plays a central role in this movement because it demands recognition of Muhammad and the Quran while rejecting the Gospel. Such efforts foreshadow the false religious system of Revelation 17, where the harlot (false religion) rides the Beast before being consumed by it.5. The Islamic Messiah: al-Mahdi and the AntichristIslamic eschatology anticipates the coming ofal-Mahdi, a global leader who will establish justice, unite nations, and enforce Islamic law. Strikingly, his description parallels the Antichrist of Scripture. The Mahdi will demand allegiance, destroy Christian symbols, and rule from Jerusalem—precisely where Revelation says the Antichrist will set up his throne (2 Thessalonians 2:4). The Islamic Jesus (Isa), who denies His crucifixion and assists the Mahdi, functions as the False Prophet. Together, they replicate the Antichrist-Beast-False Prophet triad of Revelation.Conclusion of Section 10Islam is not merely a religion among many—it is uniquely positioned to play a central role in the Beast’s final world system. By denying Christ, demanding submission, and anticipating a counterfeit messiah, Islam provides both the theological and political framework for theOne World Religion of the Antichrist.Section 11: The Quran as the Counterfeit RevelationThe Book of Revelation is thefinal prophetic disclosureof Jesus Christ, the Alpha and Omega, who unveils the consummation of history and the victory of God over evil. It contains warnings, promises, and a vision of eternal hope. In stark contrast, the Quran presents itself as a “final revelation,” yet it functions as acounterfeit to Revelation, borrowing fragments of biblical truth only to twist them into a narrative that denies Christ’s divinity and glorifies a false messenger.1. Revelation from Christ vs. Revelation from “Allah”Revelation (Bible):Given by Jesus Christ to John through an angel (Revelation 1:1). It exalts Christ as the Lamb slain, the eternal Son of God, and King of kings.Quran (Islam):Claimed to be given by Allah to Muhammad through an angel (Jibril). It denies Christ’s Sonship, rejects His cross, and elevates Muhammad as the “seal of prophets.”This structural similarity is not accidental—it is a satanic imitation. Where Christ’s Revelation ends with eternal worship of the Lamb (Revelation 22:3–5), the Quran ends with eternal servitude to Allah, a false god who cannot save.2. The Lamb vs. the BeastIn Revelation, the central figure is the Lamb of God, slain yet victorious. Worship of the Lamb leads to eternal life. In the Quran, however, the central theme is allegiance to Allah and his messenger. Instead of a Lamb who gives His life for the world, the Quran elevates a messenger who spreads his message by the sword. This contrast reflects the true vs. counterfeit savior: theLamb vs. the Beast.3. The Seal of God vs. The Mark of the BeastRevelation describes a sealing of God’s people on their foreheads (Revelation 7:3). This seal is spiritual, marking believers for divine protection and eternal life. The Quran, however, introduces a physical branding by the Beast (27:82, supported by Hadith), presenting it as a sign from Allah. What Revelation condemns as the Mark of the Beast, Islam calls a divine sign—turning salvation into damnation.4. The Warning Against Altered RevelationThe Bible ends with a stern warning:“If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book”(Revelation 22:18). The Quran, however, arrives600 years laterclaiming to correct, replace, and abrogate the Gospel. By presenting itself as a new scripture, it directly violates Revelation’s warning and places itself under judgment. The Quran is not a continuation—it is a corruption.5. A Tale of Two EternitiesRevelation’s climax:The New Jerusalem, the dwelling of God with redeemed humanity, where there is no more death, sorrow, or pain.Quran’s climax:A paradise of sensual pleasures (virgins, wine, rivers of milk and honey), appealing to earthly lusts rather than heavenly holiness.The sharp difference reveals the counterfeit nature of the Quranic “paradise.” It offers fleshly indulgence, not eternal communion with God.Conclusion of Section 11The Quran stands as thecounterfeit Revelation—a demonic inversion of the true vision given by Christ to John. Where the Bible ends with eternal worship of the Lamb, the Quran ends with eternal denial of Him. Where Revelation promises holiness, the Quran promises indulgence. Where Revelation warns against adding new prophecy, Islam adds a false book. The Quran, therefore, is not the word of God but the twisted counterfeit of the final book of Scripture.Section 12: Muhammad as the False Prophet of RevelationThe Book of Revelation does not only warn of theBeast (Antichrist)but also of theFalse Prophet, who works alongside the Beast to deceive the nations. This False Prophet performs deceptive “signs,” compels worship of the Beast, and promotes allegiance to the Beast’s system (Revelation 13:11–15). When we examine Muhammad’s life and mission, we find disturbing parallels that align him precisely with the role of the False Prophet described in Scripture.1. The False Prophet Promotes the BeastIn Revelation, the False Prophet directs humanity’s worship toward the Beast, enforcing allegiance.In Islam, Muhammad directs all devotion toward Allah—an entity who denies Christ as the Son of God (Quran 4:171, 5:72). By proclaiming a deity who is not the Father of Jesus, Muhammad promoted aBeast-like counterfeit god.2. The False Prophet Speaks “Like a Dragon”Revelation 13:11 describes the False Prophet as having two horns like a lamb but speaking like a dragon. This means he appears gentle and religious outwardly, but his words originate from satanic deception.Muhammad presented himself as a prophet in the line of Abraham, Moses, and Jesus, appearing as a continuation of biblical tradition (“two horns like a lamb”).Yet his message directly contradicts the heart of the Gospel: denying the crucifixion (Quran 4:157), the Sonship of Christ (Quran 112:3), and salvation through grace. Thisvoice of denialis the voice of the dragon.3. The False Prophet Performs Signs of DeceptionRevelation warns that the False Prophet will deceive the world with lying wonders (Revelation 13:14). Muhammad’s so-called “miracles” fit this description:Hisnight journey to heaven (Isra and Mi’raj)lacks historical or rational foundation, yet it is celebrated as proof of divine favor.His encounters withjinn—beings the Bible associates with demons—are presented as moments of revelation and conversion, when in reality they are marks of demonic alliance.The Quran itself is presented as the “greatest miracle,” but its contradictions, borrowings, and denials of biblical truth expose it as a work of deception.4. The False Prophet Enforces Worship and PersecutionRevelation describes the False Prophet enforcing worship of the Beast under penalty of death (Revelation 13:15). Islam historically follows this pattern:Apostasy laws in Sharia demand death for those who leave Islam.Non-Muslims are forced into submission under dhimma contracts, paying jizya or facing death.Entire nations were conquered under the cry of“Allahu Akbar”—not as free worship, but as enforced allegiance to Muhammad’s god.5. The Final Judgment of the False ProphetRevelation 19:20 states:“The beast was captured, and with it the false prophet who in its presence had done the signs by which he deceived those… These two were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur.”This prophetic destiny aligns with Muhammad, who spread deception, denied Christ, and led millions into error. Unless Islam’s followers repent and turn to the true Jesus Christ, both the system of the Beast and the prophet who promoted it face eternal judgment.Conclusion of Section 12When evaluated against the criteria of Revelation, Muhammad emerges not as a prophet of God, but as the very embodiment of theFalse Prophet. He denied the core of the Gospel, promoted allegiance to a counterfeit god, performed lying signs, allied with demons, and enforced submission through violence. In light of Revelation, the case is overwhelming: Muhammad fulfills the role of the False Prophet who serves the Beast, deceiving the nations until the final judgment.Section 13: The Inversion of Christ’s Gospel in IslamThe Apostle Paul warned in Galatians 1:8–9 that even if an angel from heaven preached a different gospel, it must be rejected as accursed. Islam, through Muhammad, presents itself as a continuation and correction of the biblical faith. Yet, when examined carefully, it becomes clear that Islam does not supplement the Gospel of Christ butinverts it—reversing every foundational truth into its opposite. This inversion is not merely doctrinal disagreement; it is asystematic satanic counterfeit.1. The Cross of Christ vs. Denial of the CrossThe Gospel:The crucifixion of Jesus is the central event of salvation. On the cross, Christ bore the sins of the world, reconciling humanity to God (1 Peter 2:24).Islam:The Quran explicitly denies that Jesus was crucified (Quran 4:157–158), claiming instead that it only appeared so. By removing the cross, Islam removes the atonement, leaving mankind without redemption.2. The Sonship of Christ vs. Denial of SonshipThe Gospel:Jesus is the eternal Son of God, begotten of the Father, one with Him in divinity (John 3:16; John 10:30).Islam:The Quran repeatedly denies God having a Son (Quran 112:3, 19:35, 25:2), declaring such belief as blasphemy. This strikes at the very heart of Christianity, for if Christ is not the Son, He cannot be the Savior.3. Grace vs. Works-Based SubmissionThe Gospel:Salvation is by grace through faith, not of works, so that no man may boast (Ephesians 2:8–9).Islam:Entrance to paradise depends on adherence to Islamic law, rituals, and good deeds, with no assurance of salvation except martyrdom. This shifts the focus from God’s finished work in Christ to man’s endless striving under Sharia.4. Resurrection Life vs. Earthly LustsThe Gospel:Eternal life is communion with God, where there is no death, sorrow, or sin. The redeemed are clothed in righteousness and dwell forever in God’s holy presence (Revelation 21:3–4).Islam:Paradise is depicted as sensual indulgence—gardens, rivers of wine, and virgins for sexual gratification (Quran 56:22–24, 78:31–34). Rather than lifting the soul into holiness, Islam’s “heaven” caters to fleshly appetites, inverting the true promise of spiritual renewal.5. Christ the Eternal Word vs. Muhammad the “Final Prophet”The Gospel:Christ is the Alpha and Omega, the final Word of God (John 1:1; Revelation 22:13). No revelation can follow Him because He is God’s full and perfect disclosure.Islam:Muhammad is called the “Seal of the Prophets” (Quran 33:40), superseding Jesus. The Quran claims to replace and correct the Gospel. This is the very fulfillment of Paul’s warning about another gospel delivered by an “angel” (Galatians 1:8).6. Freedom in Christ vs. Bondage in IslamThe Gospel:Christ liberates believers from the law of sin and death, offering freedom in the Spirit (Romans 8:2).Islam:Muslims live under fear—fear of Allah’s wrath, fear of failing rituals, fear of apostasy punishable by death. It is a religion of bondage, not freedom.Conclusion of Section 13Islam is not simply a different perspective on biblical truth; it is amirror image in reverse—a deliberate inversion of the Gospel. It denies the cross, rejects the Son, replaces grace with works, trades resurrection glory for sensual lust, substitutes Muhammad for Christ, and enslaves where Christ frees. This inversion aligns perfectly with satanic strategy: to twist God’s truth into its opposite and lead nations into darkness. Thus, Islam must not be seen as an Abrahamic sibling faith but as theantithesis of the Gospel of Christ.Section 14: The Prophetic Warning Against Islam in ScriptureThe Bible not only proclaims the truth of the Gospel but also forewarns believers about coming deceptions that would oppose Christ. These warnings find clear fulfillment in the rise of Islam, a system that denies Jesus as the Son of God, rejects the cross, and exalts a false prophet. When examined through the lens of prophecy, Islam emerges as one of the greatest fulfillments of biblical warnings against antichrist systems.1. The Spirit of Antichrist (1 John 2:22–23)John writes:“Who is the liar? It is whoever denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a person is the antichrist—denying the Father and the Son. No one who denies the Son has the Father; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also.”Islam explicitly denies Jesus as the Son of God (Quran 4:171, 19:35).By this definition, Islam is not a neutral faith but carries thespirit of antichrist.2. A Different Gospel (Galatians 1:8–9)Paul warns:“If we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let them be under God’s curse.”Islam claims to be revealed by the angel Jibril (Gabriel).Its message contradicts the Gospel by denying the crucifixion and salvation by grace.Thus, Islam falls under Paul’s curse against “another gospel.”3. The Lawless One (2 Thessalonians 2:3–4, 9–10)Paul speaks of theman of lawlessnesswho exalts himself over all that is called God and sets himself up in God’s temple. His coming will be in accordance with Satan’s work, with false signs and wonders.Muhammad exalted himself as the “seal of the prophets” and final messenger, placing his words above Christ’s.His so-called miracles, such as splitting the moon and conversing with jinn, arelying wonders.His law (Sharia) binds millions in oppression, making him a precursor to the lawless system of the Beast.4. The Beast and the False Prophet (Revelation 13, 19:20)Revelation foresees a Beast and a False Prophet who deceive the nations, enforce worship, and receive a mark.The Beast mirrors Islam’s system of enforced submission (Islamitself means submission).The False Prophet aligns with Muhammad, who compelled allegiance to Allah, persecuted dissenters, and spread his message through conquest.The eschatologicalmarkresembles Islamic prophecy about the Beast stamping people, further tying Islam to Revelation’s warnings.5. Warnings About Doctrines of Demons (1 Timothy 4:1)Paul says:“The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons.”Islam originates in Muhammad’s encounters with “revelations” accompanied by convulsions, terror, and voices he feared were demonic.His repeated interactions with jinn (which the Bible identifies as unclean spirits) confirm that Islam’s foundation rests upondoctrines of demons.6. The Rise of a False Peace (Daniel 8:25)Daniel warns of a ruler who will “by peace destroy many.” Islam historically spread by conquest but cloaked itself in the rhetoric of peace (salaam). The promise of peace under Islam is deceptive, for true peace is only found in reconciliation with God through Christ.Conclusion of Section 14Scripture leaves no ambiguity. From John’s warnings about antichrist denial of the Son, to Paul’s condemnation of another gospel, to Revelation’s vision of the False Prophet, the prophetic word consistently points toward systems like Islam. Muhammad’s message fits hand-in-glove with the biblical profile of deception: it denies the Son, proclaims another gospel from an angel, exalts a false prophet, spreads doctrines of demons, and deceives nations under the guise of peace.The Bible did not overlook Islam; it anticipated it. Thus, Christians must recognize Islam not as a parallel path to God, but as aprophetically-foretold counterfeitthat fulfills the warnings of Scripture.Section 15: The Call to Christians in the Face of Islamic DeceptionThe biblical warnings about false prophets, counterfeit gospels, and antichrist systems are not given merely to satisfy theological curiosity. They are given so that the Church maystand firm, discern truth from error, and bear witness to the Gospel of Jesus Christ in a hostile world.In light of Islam’s inversion of the Gospel and fulfillment of prophetic warnings, Christians are called to a threefold response: vigilance, proclamation, and compassion.1. Vigilance in DiscernmentThe Apostle John commands:“Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits, whether they are of God; because many false prophets have gone out into the world”(1 John 4:1). Christians must recognize Islam for what it is—a religion founded upon denial of Christ’s divinity and the corruption of the Gospel. To treat it as a parallel path to God is to ignore the clear testimony of Scripture. Discernment requires courage to call Islam what the Bible calls it: antichrist.2. Boldness in ProclamationThe Apostle Paul declared:“I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes”(Romans 1:16). The only remedy for deception is the truth of Christ crucified and risen. Christians are therefore called to boldly proclaim Jesus as the eternal Son of God, the only Savior, and the final revelation of God. This proclamation must not be watered down to accommodate interfaith harmony but must confront the lie with the truth.3. Compassion for the DeceivedWhile Islam is a system of deception, Muslims themselves are not the enemy—they are captives in need of deliverance. Paul writes:“The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel”(2 Corinthians 4:4). The Church must therefore engage Muslims not with hatred but with the compassion of Christ, praying for their eyes to be opened and their hearts to be freed. Evangelism to Muslims must be coupled with love, patience, and unwavering conviction that only Jesus saves.4. Perseverance in Spiritual WarfarePaul reminds believers:“We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places”(Ephesians 6:12). The rise of Islam is not merely historical or cultural—it is spiritual. Christians must equip themselves with the armor of God, stand firm in prayer, and resist compromise with false religion.Conclusion of Section 15In the face of Islamic deception, Christians are not called to fear but to faithfulness. We must discern the truth of Scripture, proclaim the Gospel with boldness, show compassion to Muslims trapped in error, and persevere in spiritual warfare. Revelation ends with the victory of the Lamb and those who follow Him:“They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony”(Revelation 12:11).The call to the Church is clear: hold fast to Christ, reject counterfeit gospels, and bear witness to the only Savior who is the Way, the Truth, and the Life (John 14:6). In doing so, we expose the lie of Islam and magnify the eternal glory of the Lamb who reigns forever.Conclusion and SummaryThis study has systematically examined Islam through the lens of biblical prophecy, apocalyptic literature, and theological discernment, revealing Islam not as a continuation of divine revelation but as a counterfeit system aligned with end-time deception. Across fifteen sections, we have traced the interconnection between Islamic claims and the eschatological warnings given in the Holy Scriptures, concluding that Islam fulfills the prophetic profile of the Beast system, the false prophet, and the great deception foretold in Revelation and the Pauline epistles.Summary of Key ArgumentsIntroduction to Revelation 13 and Islamic ParallelsRevelation 13 warns of a Beast rising with deceptive power and authority, demanding allegiance through false miracles and blasphemous claims. When read in parallel with Islamic eschatology, particularly in the Qur’an and Hadith traditions, striking similarities emerge.The Beast, the False Witness, and the Mark of IslamIslam introduces concepts of a “Beast from the Earth” (Qur’an 27:82–83), a false witness against humanity (Qur’an 16:84–85), and a mark of allegiance (Qur’an 55:41), directly paralleling Revelation 13:11–18. These connections demonstrate that Islam’s eschatology mirrors, yet distorts, biblical prophecy.The False Prophet in Islamic TextsThe Qur’an and Hadith portray a future eschatological figure, particularly ‘Isa (Islamic Jesus), who denies the crucifixion and divinity of Christ. This “prophet” proclaims an anti-gospel, aligning closely with the False Prophet of Revelation who points the nations away from Christ.The Antichrist System and Islamic TheologyJohn describes Antichrist as one who denies the Father and the Son (1 John 2:22). Islam categorically denies Jesus’ Sonship and the Trinity, placing it firmly within the biblical definition of antichrist.The Mark of the Beast and Islamic SymbolsThe profession of the Shahada, enforced submission, and eschatological allegiance to the Mahdi and Islamic Jesus serve as equivalents to the “mark” in Revelation 13—symbols of ultimate loyalty to a counterfeit god.Islam’s Reversal of Biblical ProphecyIslamic eschatology consistently inverts biblical truths: Christ the returning King becomes subordinate to the Mahdi, the Antichrist becomes the Christian Messiah, and the cross is replaced by denial of crucifixion. This inversion demonstrates satanic mimicry.The Global Dominion of IslamRevelation describes a Beast exercising global dominion. Islam’s long-standing claim of universal submission under sharia, coupled with its expansionist eschatology, mirrors the apocalyptic vision of a religious-political empire seeking world domination.The Deceptive Power of Islamic RevelationMuhammad’s “revelations” bear the marks of deception—ecstatic seizures, contradictory teachings, and denial of Christ’s divinity. This corresponds with Paul’s warning in Galatians 1:8 of a “different gospel” delivered by an angelic messenger.The Role of the Dragon in Empowering IslamRevelation 13 emphasizes the Dragon (Satan) giving power to the Beast. Islam’s denial of Christ and violent enforcement of submission reveal the fingerprints of the Dragon, whose mission is to deceive the nations.The Quran as the Counterfeit ScriptureThe Qur’an positions itself as a “final revelation” while simultaneously undermining the Torah and Gospel. This fulfills the pattern of counterfeit scripture, imitating the form of divine revelation but stripping it of redemptive truth.Muhammad as the False Prophet of RevelationMuhammad fits the biblical profile of the False Prophet: he led people into idolatry of a false god (Allah), rejected Christ’s crucifixion, and validated his authority through coercion and false miracles.The Inversion of Christ’s Gospel in IslamWhere Christ proclaims salvation by grace through His death and resurrection, Islam offers salvation through works, law, and denial of the cross. This inversion is the hallmark of an antichrist gospel.Prophetic Warnings Against Islam in ScriptureThe Bible repeatedly warns of deceivers, false prophets, and systems that exalt themselves against the knowledge of Christ (2 Thessalonians 2; Matthew 24). Islam embodies these warnings, providing a living fulfillment of biblical prophecy.The Christian Response in the Face of Islamic DeceptionBelievers are called not to fear but to stand firm in truth, armed with discernment and the gospel of Jesus Christ. The call is to evangelize Muslims with love while rejecting the falsehood of Islam as a satanic counterfeit.Final ConclusionThe cumulative evidence demonstrates that Islam is not merely another world religion but a prophetically significant system of deception. It parallels the warnings of Revelation 13, mirrors the characteristics of the Beast and False Prophet, and actively denies the central truth of Christianity—the death, resurrection, and divinity of Jesus Christ. As such, Islam represents one of the clearest fulfillments of biblical prophecy concerning the end-time deception.Christians, therefore, must remain vigilant, discerning, and unwavering in the truth of the gospel. The Lamb who was slain is the true Redeemer, and no counterfeit system can prevail against His eternal kingdom. Revelation assures believers of Christ’s ultimate victory: the Beast, the False Prophet, and the Dragon will be cast into the lake of fire (Revelation 20:10). Our confidence rests not in fear of Islam but in the sovereignty of Christ, who has overcome the world.",

The incident underscores the growing tension between constitutional religious freedoms and sociocultural pressures within some Ugandan communities. Through a factual account and theological reflection, this article seeks to highlight the urgent need for protection of religious converts and the promotion of peaceful coexistence among adherents of different faiths.1. IntroductionReligious freedom remains a fundamental human right enshrined in the Constitution of Uganda and affirmed in international human rights conventions. However, despite these legal guarantees, incidents of persecution continue to emerge, particularly against Muslim converts to Christianity. On September 1, 2025, in Mbale City, Eastern Uganda, a tragic event unfolded whenAkram Kairoki, a Muslim student, allegedly murdered his younger brotherShafiki Wasikefor renouncing Islam and embracing the Christian faith.2. The IncidentAccording toMorning Star News(October 1, 2025), the victim,Shafiki Wasike, aged 19, was a recent convert to Christianity. His conversion occurred onAugust 31, 2025, after attending an open-air evangelistic meeting organized byBible Evangelism Ministries. The event featured a public debate betweenPastor David Wabombaand a Muslim debater,Sheik Abudallah, focusing on the theological distinctions between Christianity and Islam.Pastor Wabomba reported that after the debate, Wasike accepted Christ as his Savior and expressed deep joy about his new faith. However, later that evening, his brother, Akram, began sending threatening messages, accusing him of bringing shame upon their Muslim family and the broader Islamic community. Despite the threats, Wasike remained firm in his newfound faith.Tragically, the following morning, while the two brothers were walking to school,Kairoki allegedly stabbed Wasike twice, once in the chest and once near the ribs. Eyewitnesses and classmates —Jonathan Kabaale,Ronald Mukhwana, andJohn Michael Musamali— rushed to the scene and attempted to save him by transporting him to a nearby hospital. Before succumbing to his wounds, Wasike reportedly said,“Why should my brother stab me? I have done nothing wrong to him. It is only changing my faith and joining the Christian faith.”3. Police Investigation and Legal ProceedingsFollowing an intensive manhunt, Ugandan police arrested the suspect inNakwigalo Cell, Busolwe Town Council, Butaleja District. According toRogers Taitika, police spokesperson for the Elgon Region, the suspect has been charged with murder and awaits trial atMbale City Police Station. Police officials have reiterated that under Ugandan law, individuals aged 15 and above can face prosecution for serious criminal offenses.4. Funeral and Family ReactionWasike was laid to rest onSeptember 8, 2025, at the family’s ancestral home inKabwagasi Town Council. Pastor Wabomba, who officiated the funeral, reported that several family and clan members refused to participate in the burial, declaring Wasike aninfidelfor converting to Christianity. This rejection illustrates the deep-rooted cultural stigma and ostracism faced by religious converts in some communities within Uganda.5. Religious Freedom and Persecution in UgandaUganda’s legal framework protects religious liberty, including the right to change one’s faith and to propagate religious beliefs. However, practical realities in certain regions — especially ineastern Uganda, where Muslim populations are more concentrated — reveal ongoing persecution against converts. Christian organizations and advocacy groups have documented several such incidents, raising concerns about the state’s enforcement of constitutional guarantees.From a theological standpoint, this case reflects Jesus’ warning inMatthew 10:21-22,“Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death. You will be hated by everyone because of me, but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved.”Such passages illuminate the spiritual cost of discipleship and the courage required to confess Christ in hostile environments.6. Theological ReflectionThe martyrdom of converts likeShafiki Wasikereminds the Christian community of the enduring price of faith. His death echoes the apostolic suffering described in the early Church, where conversion often resulted in family conflict and societal rejection. Yet, as Scripture affirms inRomans 8:35-39,“Nothing shall separate us from the love of Christ.”The Church, both local and international, bears a moral obligation to advocate for such victims, offer support to converts, and engage in interfaith dialogue rooted in truth and compassion.7. Conclusion and RecommendationsThe case ofShafiki Wasikeserves as a solemn reminder of the fragility of religious freedom and the cost of discipleship in certain parts of the world.Recommendations:Strengthen legal protectionfor converts through active enforcement of constitutional rights.Enhance interfaith dialogueto promote tolerance and peaceful coexistence.Provide pastoral care and discipleship trainingfor new converts facing persecution.Encourage Christian advocacy networksto monitor and report incidents of religious violence.ReferencesMorning Star News.“Christian Teen Murdered by Brother for Converting to Christianity.”October 1, 2025.Uganda Constitution, Chapter Four: Protection and Promotion of Fundamental and Other Human Rights and Freedoms.The Holy Bible (Matthew 10:21-22; Romans 8:35-39).About the AuthorDr. Maxwell Shimbais the Founder and President ofShimba Theological Institute, a research and theological training center committed to advancing Christian scholarship, defending faith freedom, and promoting interreligious understanding.

    "full_content": "Title: Divine Judgment or Historical Irony? An Examination of Muhammad’s Death in Light of Quranic and Hadith SourcesAuthor: Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological Institute, New York, NYAbstract:This article critically examines the circumstances surrounding the death of Prophet Muhammad by analyzing Quranic revelation, canonical Hadith literature, and historical events such as the raid on Khaibar. It interrogates the theological and prophetic implications of Muhammad’s own testimony regarding his terminal illness, allegedly caused by poison administered after the Khaibar massacre. A striking correlation is drawn between his manner of death and a Quranic passage (Surah 69:44–46), which articulates the punishment that would befall a prophet who falsely attributed revelations to God. This paper challenges Islamic orthodoxy by posing the question: was Muhammad’s death a fulfillment of divine judgment as outlined in the Qur’an?1. IntroductionThe legacy of Prophet Muhammad in Islamic theology is that of theSeal of the Prophets—a man divinely protected and inspired. Yet, there remains a critical and largely avoided episode in Islamic history that continues to spark theological debate: the poisoning incident at Khaibar. This article revisits the historical context of the Jewish settlement of Khaibar, the actions taken by Muhammad and his followers, and his eventual death from long-term complications attributed to poisoning. Through this inquiry, we explore the unsettling yet unavoidable question: did Allah himself end Muhammad’s life in accordance with Qur’anic judgment reserved for false prophets?2. The Raid on Khaibar and Its AftermathIn approximately 629 A.D., Muhammad led a surprise military expedition against the Jewish community of Khaibar. The Muslim biographer Ibn Ishaq and hadith compilers such as Al-Bukhari and Muslim detail the capture, killing, and torture of the Jewish chieftain, Kinana ibn al-Rabi. Kinana was reportedly tortured to disclose hidden wealth, and upon his refusal, he was executed.Following the conquest, a Jewish woman, Zaynab bint Al-Harith, offered Muhammad poisoned meat—an act motivated by vengeance or divine test. Muhammad consumed a portion and immediately sensed the poison but did not expel it fast enough. Although he survived the initial poisoning, he continued to complain of its effects until his death three years later.3. Hadith Evidence: Muhammad’s Own WordsThe most telling admission comes from the Sahih al-Bukhari:*NarratedAisha:**   *\"The Prophet (ﷺ) in his ailment in which he died, used to say, 'OAisha! I still feel the pain caused by the food I ate at Khaibar, and at this time, I feel as if my aorta is being cut from that poison.'\"(Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 4428)This statement is particularly significant as it aligns with a dire warning from the Qur’an:4. Qur'anic Cross-Reference: The Aorta VerseSurah Al-Haqqah (The Reality) 69:44–46 reads:\"And if he (Muhammad) had forged a false saying concerning Us, We surely should have seized him by his right hand; then We certainly would have cut off his aorta.\"This passage clearly outlines divine punishment for any prophet who fabricates revelation. The use of the termaorta(al-watin) in both the Qur’an and Muhammad’s own reported statement is noteworthy and cannot be dismissed as linguistic coincidence. If taken literally, it would imply that Muhammad died under the very judgment described in the Qur’an.5. Theological ImplicationsIf Muhammad’s cause of death corresponds to the Qur’anic warning for false prophets, three possibilities emerge:Muhammad falsely attributed words to Allah and was punished accordingly.The Qur’anic warning was not fulfilled, which would challenge the Qur’an’s own integrity.Or, Muhammad's death was coincidental, and his aortic pain was unrelated to any divine warning—an unlikely proposition given his own testimony.Muslim apologists argue that the verse is metaphorical or the hadith is weak in interpretation. However, both sources—Sahih Bukhariand the Qur’an—are deemed authoritative in Sunni Islam, making such dismissals theologically problematic.6. ConclusionThis analysis brings to light a deeply controversial, yet scripturally and historically rooted dilemma in Islamic theology. The convergence of Muhammad's statement about his poisoning, the historical events at Khaibar, and the Qur’anic criteria for divine punishment of false prophets must prompt honest scholarly dialogue.If we are to take the Qur'an and Hadith literature seriously, then by Muhammad's own words and Allah's own revelation, we are left with an unavoidable question:Was Muhammad's death divinely orchestrated in judgment?Muslim scholars, believers, and critics alike must grapple with this question, as avoiding it does no justice to the integrity of religious scholarship.References:Al-Bukhari,Sahih al-Bukhari, Hadith No. 4428.Ibn Ishaq,Sirat Rasul Allah, trans.

    "full_content": "Title:Textual Dependency and Theological Divergence: A Critical Evaluation of Quranic Appropriations of Biblical NarrativesAuthor:Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute, New York, NYAbstractThis article examines the Quran’s extensive appropriation of Biblical content and its simultaneous theological divergence from Judeo-Christian doctrine. While the Quran purports to be a divine and inerrant revelation in “clear Arabic,” its reworking of key Biblical figures and narratives—such as Mary, the crucifixion, and the Christian doctrine of the Trinity—demonstrates historical confusion and doctrinal misrepresentation. The Quran's dependence on the Bible, juxtaposed with its reconfiguration of Biblical theology, raises critical questions about its claimed independence, authenticity, and divine origin.IntroductionIslamic theology posits the Quran as the final, infallible revelation from Allah, correcting distortions in the Torah, Psalms, and Gospel. Yet, an in-depth analysis of the Quranic text reveals that it leans heavily on earlier Biblical scriptures for characters, stories, and theological frameworks. This dependency becomes problematic when the Quran diverges significantly from both the content and theology of the Bible. This study explores specific examples where the Quran borrows from the Bible but introduces contradictions and historical inaccuracies that undermine its divine claims.1. Quranic Echoes of Biblical NarrativesFrom Adam to Jesus, the Quran recounts stories that are unmistakably derived from Biblical tradition. However, many of these accounts are presented in truncated, ambiguous, or distorted forms. Quranic retellings assume prior knowledge of the stories, indicating a derivative, rather than revelatory, origin. Scholars such as Sidney Griffith and Angelika Neuwirth have highlighted this textual interdependence, noting the Quran’s reliance on extrabiblical Jewish and Christian oral traditions circulating in the Arabian Peninsula during Muhammad’s time.2. Maryam and Miriam: A Genealogical AnachronismA prominent error is the confusion of Mary (mother of Jesus) with Miriam (sister of Moses and Aaron). In Surah Maryam 19:28, Mary is called the “sister of Aaron,” and in Surah At-Tahrim 66:12, she is described as the “daughter of ‘Imran”—the same name given to Moses and Aaron’s father in the Torah (Exodus 6:20). This conflation ignores the historical gap of over 1,400 years between the two women. Islamic apologists have attempted to explain this away as a spiritual or honorary title, yet the textual evidence suggests a deeper historical misunderstanding within the Quranic narrative.3. Denial of the Crucifixion: A Historical and Theological CrisisThe Quran’s assertion that Jesus was neither killed nor crucified (Surah An-Nisa 4:157) stands in direct opposition to historical evidence and the central message of the Christian Gospel. The crucifixion is attested not only by the New Testament but also by non-Christian sources such as Josephus (Antiquities18.3.3), Tacitus (Annals15.44), and the Babylonian Talmud. Rejecting the crucifixion nullifies the salvific message of Christianity and isolates Islam from the foundational truths of Christian theology.4. Misrepresentation of the Trinity as PolytheismThe Quran charges Christians with polytheism (shirk), particularly for their belief in the Trinity (Surah An-Nisa 4:171, Surah Al-Ma’ida 5:73). However, this criticism rests on a fundamental misrepresentation. Christianity affirms monotheism—one God in three persons, not three gods. Moreover, Surah Al-Ma’ida 5:116 appears to assume that Christians worship Mary as part of the Trinity, a doctrine held by no orthodox Christian tradition. This strawman argument reveals a theological misunderstanding incompatible with historical and doctrinal accuracy.5. The Quran’s Theological and Narrative DependenceDespite its claim to supersede previous scriptures, the Quran cannot stand independently of the Bible. Its characters, moral lessons, and eschatological themes are only intelligible when understood through the lens of Judeo-Christian scripture. Paradoxically, while claiming to correct the Bible, the Quran relies upon it for narrative substance. Without the Bible, the Quran's references to figures like Abraham, Joseph, Moses, and Jesus would lack coherence and context.ConclusionThe Quran’s dependence on Biblical material—combined with its distortion of foundational doctrines such as the crucifixion and the Trinity—undermines its claim of divine perfection. The confusion of historical timelines, theological mischaracterizations, and reliance on prior scriptures point not to a transcendent origin, but to a composite text drawn from oral and written traditions prevalent in 7th-century Arabia. Far from confirming the Bible, the Quran appears to borrow from it—and misinterpret it. The Bible stands independently as a coherent and historically anchored revelation. The Quran, however, cannot claim the same without facing its own internal contradictions.ReferencesAyoub, Mahmoud M.Redemptive Suffering in Islam.

    "full_content": "From Zaynab to Zion: The Symbolic and Strategic Role of Women in Jewish-Muslim ConflictsAuthor:Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteAbstract:This article explores the historical and symbolic role of women in Jewish-Muslim conflicts, beginning with the controversial account of the Prophet Muhammad’s alleged poisoning by Zaynab bint Al-Harith, and extending to the modern-day participation of Israeli women in military and intelligence operations. Through theological, historical, and gender studies lenses, the paper interrogates the evolution of female agency from biblical times to contemporary geopolitical warfare, with attention to how religious narratives and military realities intersect in shaping perceptions of power, prophecy, and divine silence.1. IntroductionThe relationship between Jewish and Muslim communities has been shaped by centuries of religious, political, and military tensions. Among the many stories that animate this historical conflict, the account of Muhammad’s poisoning by a Jewish woman, Zaynab bint Al-Harith, stands out for its enduring theological and symbolic implications. In modern times, the prominent role of Israeli women in the military—especially in elite units like Caracal and Bardelas—presents a fascinating reversal of traditional gender narratives and invites reflection on divine justice, martial symbolism, and religious trauma.2. The Death of Muhammad and the Legacy of Zaynab bint Al-HarithIslamic tradition, particularly sources such asIbn Sa'd'sTabaqat al-Kubraandal-Bukhari’s Sahih, record that the Prophet Muhammad was poisoned by a Jewish woman after the Battle of Khaybar (cf. Tabaqat Ibn Sa'd, Vol. 2, p. 249). Zaynab, motivated by vengeance or perhaps suspicion of Muhammad’s prophethood, allegedly served him poisoned lamb. When asked why, she responded: “If you are a prophet, it will not harm you. If you are not, then we are rid of you.”This episode, though contested in terms of historical reliability and theological interpretation, remains a provocative moment in Islamic historiography. Some Muslim scholars view this as a test of prophetic endurance, while others see it as divine martyrdom. Orientalist perspectives have sometimes used this account to critique Islamic conceptions of invincibility and divine protection (cf. Guillaume,The Life of Muhammad, 1967).3. The Emergence of Jewish Women as CombatantsFast forward to the 21st century: Israeli women have increasingly taken on combat and intelligence roles within the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and intelligence agencies like Mossad. Units such asCaracal,Bardelas, andOketzintegrate women into front-line operations, including border security, counter-terrorism, and surveillance missions (Sasson-Levy, 2003). TheMossadalso reportedly employs female agents in high-level espionage and assassination operations, including some allegedly linked to countering Iranian and Palestinian threats (Katz,The Mossad: The Great Operations, 2012).This shift has altered the gender dynamics of conflict, particularly in confrontations with militant Islamist groups who uphold patriarchal ideologies. The irony is stark: men who traditionally oppose female empowerment are increasingly facing skilled, disciplined female adversaries on the battlefield.4. Gender, Warfare, and Asymmetrical PowerFrom a gender studies perspective, the image of Jewish women confronting militant Muslim men offers a rich site for analysis. Scholars such as Cynthia Enloe (2000) and Carol Cohn (2013) have examined how militarized femininity can subvert traditional gender hierarchies. In the case of Israeli military women, their symbolic role challenges Islamist narratives that depict women as subordinate, domestic figures.Moreover, the use of advanced technology—often operated remotely by female personnel—creates a new layer of asymmetrical warfare. Drone warfare, for instance, distances the soldier from the battlefield, yet retains a psychological dominance over targets, especially when filtered through theological or cultural lenses.5. Theological Reflection: Divine Silence or Judgment?The apparent “silence of Allah” during conflicts where Muslim fighters face defeat, especially at the hands of women, raises important theological questions. While some Islamic apologists explain these outcomes as tests of faith, critics may argue that these events reflect a deeper crisis of theological coherence in the face of military and spiritual humiliation.From a Judeo-Christian perspective, the empowerment of women in defending Israel may be interpreted as a fulfillment of biblical prophecies, where daughters of Zion rise as warriors (cf. Judges 4:4–10; Isaiah 31:9). Some Christian Zionists view this as divine vindication in the face of eschatological battles.6. ConclusionThe symbolic continuity from Zaynab bint Al-Harith to modern Israeli female combatants reveals a layered narrative of vengeance, empowerment, and divine irony. While the story of Muhammad’s death by poison remains contested, its symbolic resonance—coupled with the military effectiveness of Jewish women today—offers a rich terrain for exploring how gender, theology, and geopolitics continue to shape Jewish-Muslim interactions.ReferencesGuillaume, A.

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis article critically examines a controversial narration found inMishkat al-Masabih, which suggests that Allah created the descendants of Adam in differing colors, allegedly preassigning white individuals to Paradise and black individuals to Hell. This analysis addresses the theological, ethical, and moral implications of such racial determinism within Islamic doctrine. It raises fundamental questions about divine justice, racial equality, and the attributes of God as both merciful and just. The article seeks to explore whether such a narrative aligns with the broader teachings of Islam or represents a later sociopolitical interpolation incompatible with a just and omnibenevolent deity.IntroductionIslam claims universality and racial equality, exemplified by verses in the Qur’an that emphasize moral conduct over ethnicity:“Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you.”(Qur’an 49:13)Yet, certain Hadiths, particularly the narration inMishkat al-Masabih, appear to contradict this inclusive ethic. The Hadith in question states:“Allah created Adam, then wiped his back, and there fell from his back every soul that He would create until the Day of Resurrection. He made some of them white and some black. Then He said: ‘To Paradise and I do not care,’ and ‘To Hell and I do not care.’”This narration, which has deeply racial overtones, raises profound theological concerns. If Allah predetermined black people to Hell and white people to Paradise, how can this be reconciled with Islamic assertions of divine justice and accountability?Historical Context and Textual ReliabilityThe Hadith in question is not found inSahih al-BukhariorSahih Muslim, the most authoritative Hadith collections in Sunni Islam, but appears inMishkat al-Masabih, which draws from various earlier compilations, includingMusnad AhmadandSunan al-Tirmidhi. This calls for an immediate investigation into theauthenticity (ṣaḥīḥ), chain of transmission (isnād), and content integrity (matn)of the narration.Was this Hadith genuinely attributed to the Prophet Muhammad, or was it a later fabrication echoing the racial hierarchies of early Islamic empires or Abbasid racial theory?Theological Implications1.Divine Justice vs. Arbitrary DamnationIf Allah predetermined black people for Hell simply based on their skin color, this challenges the Islamic concept ofAdl(divine justice). According to the Qur’an:“Every soul earns not [blame] except against itself, and no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another.”(Qur’an 6:164)This verse affirmsindividual moral responsibility. The idea that skin color alone can determine eternal damnation undermines this teaching and presents Allah as capricious—a concept rejected by Islamic theology.2.Free Will and Predestination (Qadar)Islamic thought has long wrestled with the tension between divine decree (qadar) and human free will. If racial identity predetermines one’s eternal fate, then human agency is rendered meaningless. How then can individuals be held accountable for what they neither chose nor can change?3.Ethical Monotheism vs. Racial DeterminismThe Qur’anic vision is one ofethical monotheism, where moral conduct, piety, and belief determine salvation—not ethnicity or lineage:“O mankind, We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another.”(Qur’an 49:13)To suggest that blackness itself is a marker of divine rejection is to align Islam with a form ofracial fatalism, incompatible with this verse.Comparative Religious ReflectionThis narrative mirrors other ancient worldviews in which pigmentation was linked to spiritual destiny—such as Gnostic doctrines of light vs. darkness, or certain interpretations in Hindu caste systems. However, monotheistic religions—including authentic Islam, Christianity, and Judaism—typically root divine judgment inmoral action, not melanin levels.Racism and Hadith: Social Construct or Divine Design?There is scholarly consensus thatsome Hadiths were fabricatedfor political, sectarian, or cultural motives. The Umayyad and Abbasid periods saw increased Arab supremacy narratives that often denigrated non-Arabs and darker-skinned peoples. Is this Hadith an expression of suchracial elitismrather than divine revelation?If the Prophet Muhammad truly said this, then his own multiethnic community, which included black companions like Bilal ibn Rabah, is inexplicable. Bilal was honored by Muhammad and described as having a voice that would precede him in Paradise. Such examples contradict the Hadith's implications.The Moral Problem of a Racist GodThis leads to the ultimate theological question:Can God be racist?If so, then God ceases to be morally perfect, and religion loses its claim to universal ethics. For any true faith to maintain credibility, it must offera vision of salvationthat transcends ethnicity, race, and national origin.ConclusionThe Hadith portraying black people as destined for Hell is not onlytheologically inconsistentwith core Islamic teachings but alsomorally reprehensible. It must be questioned, critiqued, and likely rejected as afabricated artifactof human prejudice—not divine decree.To accept such a Hadith without scrutiny is to do violence to the very nature of God as Just, Merciful, and Righteous. Islam must be disentangled from cultural racism to remain a credible moral force in the modern world.ReferencesQur’an 49:13, 6:164Mishkat al-Masabih, Book of FaithAl-Tabari,Tarikh al-Rusul wa al-MulukJonathan A.C.

    "full_content": "Title: Reclaiming Dignity: A Theological and Biblical Response to Islamic Female Veiling PracticesAuthor: Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute, Orlando, FloridaAbstractThis article critically evaluates the Islamic practice of female veiling, particularly the burqa and niqab, from a biblical and theological perspective. While proponents claim divine origin for such practices, a careful exegesis of both biblical and Islamic sources reveals cultural impositions rather than divine mandates. By examining the portrayal of women in the Bible—particularly Sarah, Ruth, Esther, and Mary—this paper argues that female visibility, dignity, and agency are inherent in God’s design. Furthermore, the Christian moral framework places the responsibility for lust and immorality not on women's visibility but on individual moral discipline. This paper challenges the notion that extreme veiling is a reflection of divine holiness, instead exposing it as a cultural mechanism of control rooted in patriarchal interpretation.1. IntroductionIn recent Islamic discourse, particularly within conservative jurisprudence, female veiling is presented as a divine requirement—a symbol of piety and social order. However, upon theological scrutiny, this practice appears more aligned with patriarchal cultural control than with divine ordinance. The Quranic justification is often vague, and the Hadith literature provides troubling implications about gender roles and public decency.2. Biblical Portrayal of Women and VisibilityThe Bible consistently presents women as visible, active participants in society and God’s redemptive narrative. In Genesis 12:11–13, Sarah’s beauty is acknowledged publicly. While Abraham expresses fear, the response is deception—not concealment—underscoring the cultural tension but not prescribing veiling. Ruth wins Boaz’s favor while gleaning publicly in the field (Ruth 2:2–12), and Esther enters a royal beauty contest with her appearance on full display (Esther 2:7–17). These examples demonstrate that women were neither expected to be hidden nor shamed for their beauty.Even Mary, the mother of Jesus, wore traditional modest attire consistent with Jewish customs (Luke 1:27), but there is no scriptural or historical evidence that she wore a full face veil or lived in social seclusion. Her visibility and mobility are assumed throughout the Gospel narratives (Luke 1:39–56; John 2:1–5).3. Islamic Veiling: Qur’anic and Hadith FoundationsWhile proponents of the burqa cite verses like Surah An-Nur (24:31) and Al-Ahzab (33:59), these passages mention modesty and covering the bosom but do not explicitly mandate full facial concealment or garments resembling isolation. The Quranic instruction is vague, and interpretations vary widely among Islamic scholars.However, many Hadiths present more rigid expectations. For instance,Sunan Abu Dawood 641states:\"Asma, daughter of Abu Bakr, entered upon the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) wearing thin clothes. The Messenger turned his face and said: ‘O Asma’, when a girl reaches menstruating age, it is not proper that anything should remain exposed except this and this.’ He pointed to his face and hands.\"Ironically, even this Hadith contradicts the burqa, as it permits the visibility of the face and hands—undermining claims that the burqa is divinely mandated.4. Apostolic Teaching on Head CoveringsChristian opponents of veiling often encounter Muslims citing1 Corinthians 11:5–6, where Paul discusses head coverings for women. However, a contextual reading shows that Paul is addressing worship conduct within church gatherings—not public dress codes. Moreover, Paul refers only to covering thehead, not theface, and makes no reference to bodily obscuration. His concern is theological symbolism within the Corinthian church, not a universal dress code (Keener, 2014).5. Theological and Ethical ImplicationsJesus Christ rebuked those who enforced human traditions as divine commands:“They worship me in vain; their teachings are merely human rules. You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to human traditions” (Mark 7:7–8, NIV).The excessive veiling of women under Islamic law falls within the purview of man-made tradition rather than God-breathed commandment. In Christian theology, morality is grounded not in controlling others’ visibility but in cultivating internal holiness (Matthew 5:27–30). It is the lustful heart that is condemned, not the female presence.6. ConclusionScripture does not support the erasure of women through full veiling practices. Rather, it affirms their dignity, presence, and purpose in society. The burden of moral conduct is not on a woman’s concealment but on every individual's discipline and submission to God. Christianity liberates women from cultural impositions masquerading as divine commands. Any religious practice that seeks to erase, hide, or diminish half of humanity must be evaluated not by its cultural defensibility but by its theological legitimacy.BibliographyAl-Qur'an.

    "full_content": "Title: The Role and Status of Women in Islam: A Theological and Anthropological CritiqueBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis article examines the theological, cultural, and hermeneutical interpretations of the status of women in Islamic theology, particularly through an exegesis of Qur’anic texts and Hadith literature. It critically assesses the implications of certain Islamic scriptures on gender roles, autonomy, and dignity from a Judeo-Christian theological and anthropological perspective. While recognizing the diversity of Islamic interpretations, this analysis underscores the systemic gender imbalance embedded in classical Islamic thought, arguing that it falls short of recognizing women as fully human agents created in the image of God.IntroductionIn the Abrahamic religious traditions, the question of gender equity remains a central theological and ethical concern. Islam, the second largest religion globally, offers a particular worldview on gender roles rooted in Qur’anic texts and the Sunnah (Prophet Muhammad’s traditions). While modern Islamic apologists and reformers have attempted to reinterpret many of these texts in egalitarian terms, a critical reading of foundational sources reveals persistent anthropological reductionism in the depiction of women. This paper aims to demonstrate that such portrayals not only diminish the spiritual and intellectual dignity of women but also contradict the ethical framework of human worth found in other monotheistic traditions.I. Women as “Tilth”: A Textual Exegesis of Qur’an 2:223The Qur’an in Surah al-Baqarah 2:223 states:“Your wives are a tilth for you; so go to your tilth [when] however you will...” (Qur’an 2:223, Sahih International).The metaphor of a woman astilth(Arabic: حرث) denotes agricultural land to be plowed and sown—conveying reproductive utility. Classical Islamic jurists interpreted this verse as a divine sanction for male sexual access and dominance (Ibn Kathir,Tafsir al-Qur’an al-Azim; Al-Tabari,Jamiʿ al-bayan). While some modern scholars argue for metaphorical interpretations (Esack, 2005), the overwhelming historical consensus regards women as reproductive vessels. The woman’s body, in this view, is a field—a passive object—while the man assumes the role of the active farmer. This sexualized agricultural analogy imposes utilitarianism upon womanhood, fundamentally reducing the female body to a biological function.II. Intellectual Inferiority in Hadith TraditionThe Hadith literature contains repeated references to women’s alleged intellectual and moral inferiority. Sahih al-Bukhari records the Prophet Muhammad as saying:“I have not seen anyone more deficient in intelligence and religion than you [women]” (Sahih al-Bukhari, Book 6, Hadith 301).The Hadith claims that women are intellectually deficient due to their emotional nature and religiously deficient due to exemptions from prayer and fasting during menstruation. Classical commentators like Al-Ghazali (Ihya Ulum al-Din) and Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani (Fath al-Bari) accepted this framework uncritically. This theological anthropology constructs a gendered hierarchy of intellect and piety, which has often justified gender-based educational deprivation in many Muslim-majority societies.III. Gendered Modesty and The Erasure of Female PresenceQur’an 33:59 commands:“O Prophet, tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to bring down over themselves [part] of their outer garments...” (Qur’an 33:59, Sahih International).This verse, combined with traditional Hadiths such as Abu Dawud 32:4092 and Bukhari 8:74:257, is interpreted by many jurists as requiring women to cover their entire bodies, including the face, hands, and voice in public. The reasoning often revolves around the notion of male sexual weakness and the need to prevent societalfitna(chaos). The outcome, however, is the erasure of the female face from the public sphere—an anthropological anomaly among world religions. Muslim women, in some cultures, are discouraged from speaking, eating in public, or expressing emotion lest they provoke male arousal. The woman becomes not a person but a potentialfitnato be veiled, silenced, and secluded.IV. Theological Implications: From Personhood to MechanismWhen religious doctrine reduces a woman to a womb (rahim), a field (harth), and a temptation (fitna), the implications are deeply dehumanizing. The Qur’an and Hadith construct a theological anthropology in which women are not independent moral agents but extensions of male will and divine reproduction. If women exist primarily for childbearing and obedience, then their emotional, intellectual, and spiritual dimensions are sidelined. In essence, the portrayal resembles that of a programmed reproductive mechanism rather than a fully realized person.V. Contrasting with the Biblical View of WomanhoodThe Judeo-Christian tradition presents a stark contrast. In Genesis 1:27, the human being—male and female—is createdimago Dei(in the image of God). Eve is described not as farmland but as a helper suitable (ezer kenegdo)—an equal partner (Genesis 2:18). Proverbs 31 exalts the wisdom, strength, and enterprise of a virtuous woman. In the New Testament, women are the first witnesses to the Resurrection (Luke 24), recipients of spiritual gifts (Acts 2:17), and equal heirs of salvation (Galatians 3:28). This theological anthropology affirms womanhood in its fullness—spiritual, rational, emotional, and vocational.ConclusionWhile Islamic sources contain some verses advocating kindness and respect toward women, the dominant theological and hermeneutical framework portrays women as functional tools—be it for reproduction, pleasure, or temptation-avoidance. Such a worldview reduces personhood to utility and violates the dignity inherent in all humans created in the image of God. If Islam's conception of womanhood is to be redeemed, it must transcend the mechanistic, reproductive metaphor and affirm the holistic personhood of women as moral, intellectual, and spiritual equals.ReferencesAl-Tabari.Jamiʿ al-Bayan fi Ta'wil al-Qur'an.

A Theological Analysis of Jinn in Islam and the Christian Prohibition of Communion with Evil SpiritsBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba | Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis article critically examines the Islamic conception of Jinn and their theological relationship with humans—particularly Muslims—as depicted in the Hadith literature and the Qur'an. Drawing on primary Islamic sources, such asSahih MuslimandJami' at-Tirmidhi, alongside Qur’anic references like Surah Al-A’raf (7:202), this paper highlights a significant contrast between Islamic acceptance of interaction with Jinn and the biblical injunction against all communion with demons. The Christian Scriptures—particularly the Pauline epistles and Gospel narratives—portray demons as unclean spirits, completely opposed to God and unfit for any fellowship. The article thus asserts that Islam’s implicit fraternal relationship with Jinn contradicts the clear separation between light and darkness upheld in biblical theology.IntroductionThe presence and influence of supernatural beings are acknowledged across many religious traditions. In Islam,Jinn—invisible beings created from smokeless fire—are a core part of Islamic cosmology. However, their theological relationship with Muslims, as represented in both Hadith and Qur’anic texts, poses a significant contrast with the biblical worldview. While Islam accommodates interaction, even respect, for Jinn, Christianity categorically forbids any relationship with demonic beings, identifying them as agents of Satan and enemies of God.This article will explore:Islamic texts which suggest a form of \"brotherhood\" or affinity between Muslims and Jinn;Qur’anic references where devils are called “brothers” to humans;The Christian biblical teaching that absolutely forbids all communion with demons; andThe Christological authority over demons as the basis for Christian deliverance.1. The Brotherhood Between Muslims and Jinn in Islamic TraditionInSahih Muslim 450a, the Prophet Muhammad warns his followers:\"Do not perform istinja (ritual cleaning) with dung or bones, for they are the food of your brothers among the Jinn.\"This statement explicitly refers to the Jinn as the “brothers” of Muslims. In Islamic cosmology, Jinn are rational beings endowed with free will, capable of choosing between good and evil, and are subject to divine judgment like humans. This anthropomorphic parallel creates an ontological and theological nearness between humans and Jinn that opens the door to religious and social familiarity.Likewise,Jami’ at-Tirmidhi 3258reinforces the idea:“They are the provision for your brothers among the Jinn.”These narrations establish not only interaction but communal care, where humans are instructed to preserve certain materials (like bones) for the sustenance of Jinn. Such instructions go beyond mere coexistence and suggest a degree of spiritual or religious fraternity.2. The Qur’an and Jinn as Brothers in ErrorInSurah Al-A’raf 7:202, the Qur'an notes:“But their brothers—the devils—increase them in error, then they do not stop short.”(Sahih International)“As for their brethren [the Satans], they draw them deeper into error.”(Maududi)Here, the Qur’anic depiction confirms a \"brotherhood\" between humans and devils (shayatin). The term “akhwānuhum” (their brothers) used in the Arabic denotes intimate moral or spiritual affinity, not mere metaphor. Thus, the Qur’an itself implicitly sanctions the idea that humans may have relational or behavioral alignment with devils—a notion foreign and heretical from a biblical standpoint.3. Christian Teaching: Absolute Separation from DemonsThe New Testament categorically forbids any interaction with demonic forces. Paul, writing to the Corinthians, says:“You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons too; you cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons.”(1 Corinthians 10:21, NLT)This warning sets a clear moral and spiritual dichotomy between God’s people and demonic entities. No spiritual brotherhood or alliance is ever permitted. Furthermore, demons are portrayed as utterly deceptive, destructive, and subject to divine judgment.4. Christ's Authority Over DemonsThe Gospels present Jesus Christ as having total authority over demons, who tremble at His presence:“The demons kept begging Jesus not to send them into the bottomless pit.”(Luke 8:31, NLT)This verse demonstrates not only the fear demons have of Christ but also reinforces the Christian belief that demons are in direct opposition to the Son of God. No Christian would ever claim demons as spiritual brethren. Rather, they are enemies of righteousness, to be cast out in Jesus’ name (Mark 16:17).Conclusion: Contrasting WorldviewsIslam’s view of the Jinn as “brothers,” whether metaphorical or literal, reveals a theological openness that significantly diverges from the biblical worldview. Christianity, rooted in the authority of Scripture and the person of Jesus Christ, recognizes demons as fallen beings, entirely opposed to God’s kingdom. The moral implications are significant:In Islam, interaction and recognition of Jinn as spiritual kin is recorded in both the Hadith and Qur’an.In Christianity, any such relationship is categorically condemned and seen as spiritual adultery.This theological divide reveals deeper questions about the nature of divine revelation, the spiritual realm, and humanity's relationship to the unseen. Christians are called to spiritual purity, resisting the devil (James 4:7) and remaining sanctified through Christ. Islam, by contrast, presents a framework where fellowship with Jinn is conceivable—even commendable.BibliographyAl-Bukhari, Muhammad ibn Ismail.Sahih al-Bukhari.Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj.Sahih Muslim 450a.https://sunnah.com/muslim:450aAt-Tirmidhi, Muhammad ibn Isa.Jami’ at-Tirmidhi 3258.https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:3258The Qur’an, Surah Al-A’raf (7:202).

Such interactions are fundamentally inconsistent with the teachings of the Bible, where all prophets, under the authority of the One True God, cast out demons and rebuked evil spirits. This study critically analyzes Quranic passages, compares them with Biblical theology, and raises pressing questions about Muhammad’s prophethood, his divine commission, and the nature of Allah in contrast to the God of the Bible. If Muhammad befriended and taught Jinns instead of casting them out, it calls into question whether he was truly sent by the Holy God of the Bible.IntroductionIslamic tradition upholds the account of Muhammad preaching to and converting Jinns to Islam. This claim is based on several Quranic references, particularly Surah al-Jinn and Surah Ah’kaf. Unlike the prophets of the Bible who never sought fellowship with demons or unclean spirits, Muhammad’s engagement with Jinns raises severe theological red flags. This paper seeks to highlight the contradictions between Muhammad’s actions and the pattern of Biblical prophethood, examining whether such behavior aligns with the God who declared in Leviticus 19:31:\"Do not turn to mediums or seek out spiritists, for you will be defiled by them. I am the Lord your God.\"1.The Biblical Stance on Jinns (Demons): Absolute RejectionIn both Old and New Testaments, demons (equivalent to Jinns in Islamic terminology) are consistently portrayed as unclean, deceptive, and destructive. The prophets of God did not dialogue with them but cast them out through divine authority. Consider:Jesus Christ’s Ministry:“And he healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons” (Mark 1:34).“He gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases” (Luke 9:1).Prophets like Moses, Elijah, and Elishanever communicated with evil spirits but strictly condemned all spiritualistic practices.Isaiah 8:19–“When someone tells you to consult mediums and spiritists, who whisper and mutter, should not a people inquire of their God?”If God’s true messengers strictly opposed interaction with unclean spirits, how could Muhammad—a man who claimed prophethood—spend the entire night preaching to Jinns and accepting their allegiance?2.Islamic Accounts of Muhammad’s Interaction with JinnsIslamic texts describe Muhammad being approached by Jinns who listened to his recitation of the Qur’an and embraced Islam. Notably:Surah al-Jinn (72:1-2):“A group of the Jinn listened and said: ‘We have heard a wonderful recitation... so we have believed in it.’”Surah Ah’kaf (46:29):“We directed a group of Jinns to you to listen to the Qur’an…”Laylatul Jinn: The night Muhammad claimed he was teaching a group of Jinns over the mountain, away from his companions, and even ate with them.These narratives show a stark contrast to the character and methods of Biblical prophets, who were filled with the Holy Spirit and rebuked such spirits.3.The Theological Dissonance: Allah and the God of the Bible Are Not the SameThe God of the Bible is Holy, and His prophets were set apart from the unclean world of spirits. Allah, as presented in the Qur’an, seems permissive of spiritual interaction that is otherwise condemned in Biblical revelation. Key contradictions include:God’s Holiness vs. Allah’s Association:“What fellowship can light have with darkness?” (2 Corinthians 6:14)Demons Recognize God but Are Not Converted:“You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe—and shudder!” (James 2:19)The notion ofconverting demons to righteousnessis alien to the Bible. Demons acknowledge the authority of Jesus but are judged, not saved. Therefore, the claim that Jinns became “Muslim” under Muhammad indicates that the god they turned to is not the Holy God of Israel.4.Critical Questions That Demand Scholarly AttentionA. If Muhammad taught Jinns, why did he not cast them out in the power of God, as all Biblical prophets did?B. Why did the Qur’an not affirm the holiness and complete otherness of God by rejecting all interaction with spiritual beings?C. Why is there no record of any Biblical prophet ever being aided or receiving followers among demons?D. If Muhammad’s prophetic call was from the God of Abraham, why do his actions directly contradict Yahweh’s commands?E. How can one reconcile the Islamic claim of continuity with the Bible when Muhammad’s ministry diverges so dramatically in spiritual doctrine and practice?F. Why did Allah allow interaction with spirit beings that the God of the Bible explicitly callsan abomination?G. If the Jinns accepted Islam, does that mean demons can be righteous? Is this not a reversal of God’s established moral and spiritual order?H. Does this not make Muhammad not only a teacher of men but also a shepherd of demons?I. Why did the Qur’an contradict the Bible’s teaching on demonology yet claim to confirm the previous Scriptures (Surah 5:46)?5.Conclusion: A Prophet of Another Spirit?The interaction between Muhammad and the Jinns poses a significant theological dilemma. It is a departure from the Biblical pattern of holiness, authority, and separation from the spiritual forces of darkness. This paper concludes that such interaction is not a mark of divine approval but rather of spiritual compromise. The God of the Bible stands opposed to all forms of demonic engagement, while Muhammad's reported encounters reflect an entirely different spiritual paradigm.The spirit behind Muhammad’s ministry, therefore, must be re-evaluated in light of Scripture:“Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God...” (1 John 4:1)The conclusion is unmistakable:Muhammad’s interaction with Jinns places his prophethood in question and reveals that the Allah he served is not the Holy God of the Bible.By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaPresident, Shimba Theological Institutewww.shimbatheology.org",

One verse on the subject reads:Say: \"It has been revealed to me that a band of the jinn listened and said, 'We have heard a most amazing Recitation. It leads to right guidance so we believe in it and will not associate anyone with our Lord.'\" Surah al-Jinn: 1-2In that same Surah, Allah also reveals that some Jinn are actually Muslims:[The Jinn said]: \"And when we heard the guidance, we believed in it. Anyone who believes in his Lord need fear neither belittlement nor tyranny. Some of us are Muslims and some are deviators. Those who have become Muslim are those who sought right guidance.\" Surah al-Jinn: 13-14When the servant of Allah stands calling on Him, they almost swarm all over him. Surah al-Jinn: 19Yet another verse recounts that when the Prophet ﷺ gave guidance regarding Deen, the jinn would gather around him and listen carefully:And [mention, O Muhammad], when We directed to you a few of the jinn, listening to the Qur'an. And when they attended it, they said, \"Listen quietly.\" And when it was concluded, they went back to their people as warners. Surah Ah’kaf- 29These verses make it clear that Prophet Muhammad ﷺ was sent as a Prophet for all mankind and the jinn. The Qur'an is a guide for both mankind and the Jinn.When the Jinns invited the Prophet ﷺ to their colonyOnce the Prophet ﷺ visited Taif to invite the people to Islam. He wanted to talk to the people of the town to invite them to Islam but they all shut their doors on his face and rejected him. Zaid bin Haris (May Allah be pleased with him) was his Companion. Both of them went to their leader, who rejected them as well. He asked his slaves and young boys to drive them away.. They threw stones at them to drive them out of the town. Both of them were injured. Our Prophet ﷺ bled so much that his shoes were filled with his blood and got stuck to his feet. The Prophet ﷺ felt dizzy .Zaid (May Allah be pleased with him) said, “I helped the Prophet ﷺ to leave the village and we rested under a tree.” Both men then returned to Makkah. On the way, at Watane Nakhla, Prophet ﷺ woke up to offer Tahajjud and recited the Qur’an.The Jinns of that time had noticed that they could not cross over the heavens and hear the conversations of the angels anymore, rather they were chased by meteors and were driven away. Their leader instructed them to find out the reason so they wandered around. There was a valley called Nasibi which was inhibited by Jinns. These Jinns passed by the place at night when they heard the recitation. The group heard the melodious recitation of our Prophet ﷺ and were entranced. Without the knowledge of our Prophet ﷺ that group of Jinn accepted Islam. It was then the above verses of Surah Jinn were revealed. The point to be noted is that the humans of Taif rejected the Message of Allah but the Jinn accepted it. Allah truly does not let the efforts of the Believers go in vain.Once the Prophet ﷺ was sitting with his Companions. He had to go to attend the call of nature. He went a bit farther and did not return for a long time. The Companions were worried about his absence and feared that he had been abducted. They searched for him the whole night. In the morning, the Prophet ﷺ returned. When the Companions inquired, he replied, “I was called by a group of Jinns over that mountain, who had embraced Islam and wanted to learn the religion from me. It took me the whole night to teach them”. This night is called “Laylatul Jinn”. The Companions then went along him to the place and saw burnt sticks and ash which indicated that food was cooked that night. Therefore, it is essential to believe that the Prophet ﷺ was sent even to the Jinn.WRITE ACADEMIC RESEARCH AND SCHOLARLY ARTICLE QUESTIONING MUHAMMAD INTERACTED WITH JINNS WHICH IS AGAINST THE GOD OF THE BIBLEALL PROPHETS AND MESSENGERS WERE AGAINST JINNS AND CASTOUT JINNS BUT MUHAMMAD CONVERTED THEM TO ISLAMTHAT MEANS ALLAH IS NOT GOD OF THE BIBLEQURAN DOES NOT AFFIRMS THE PREVIOUS BOOKSMUHAMMAD WAS A PROPHET OF NOT THE GOD WHO IS AGAINST JINNSADD MORE QUESTION TO THE ARTICLE QUESTIONING MUHAMMAD PROPHETHOODBy Dr Maxwell Shimba from Shimba Theological Institute",

    "full_content": "Title: Theological Inquiries into the Islam of the Jinn: Prophethood, Revelation, and the Ummah of the UnseenBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstract:The Qur'an asserts the existence of Jinn as intelligent, moral beings created from smokeless fire and capable of belief and disbelief. Notably,Surah al-Jinn (72:13–14)describes a group of Jinn who heard the Qur'anic message, believed in it, and identified themselves as Muslims. This passage raises complex theological and doctrinal questions regarding the prophetic dispensation to the Jinn, the role of Muhammad in their salvation history, and the consistency of Qur'anic claims about each nation (ummah) receiving its own prophet and scripture. This article aims to critically explore these tensions and offer a framework for theological debate within Islamic and interreligious studies.1. Introduction: The Jinn as Believers and Moral Agents in IslamIn Islamic theology, Jinn are supernatural beings with free will, capable of good and evil, much like humans. They are accountable to God and are subject to the same eschatological destiny: either Paradise or Hell. According toSurah al-Jinn, a group of Jinn heard the Qur’an and believed, becoming Muslims. However, this account introduces a number of unresolved theological issues when examined in light of broader Qur'anic doctrine regarding prophecy and scripture:“We sent a messenger to every nation…”(Qur’an 16:36)“And for every nation is a messenger…”(Qur’an 10:47)If eachummah(nation or community) is to receive a prophet and scripture, then who was sent to the Jinn? And if Muhammad was their prophet, how does this reconcile with the principle that each community has its own specific messenger?2. Who Is the Prophet of the Jinn?The Qur’an never explicitly names a prophet sentexclusivelyto the Jinn. The story inSurah al-Jinnsuggests that the Jinn came into contact with the message of Muhammad indirectly—by overhearing his recitation or through attending gatherings where the Qur’an was proclaimed.Questions arising:If the Jinn were a distinct ummah, why were they not given their own prophet, as the Qur’an consistently claims happens with every nation?Is Muhammad to be considered the prophet of both humans and Jinn? If so, why was there no direct da’wah (prophetic outreach) to the Jinn recorded in detail in Hadith or Qur’anic narrative?Does this imply a shared ummah between humans and Jinn, or a blurring of Qur'anic theological boundaries?3. Was a Book Revealed to the Jinn?Nowhere in the Qur’an is it stated that the Jinn were given a separate scripture. TheJinn who accepted Islamdid so after hearingthe Qur’an, a text revealed to a human prophet, Muhammad ibn Abdullah. This raises further theological concerns:Key Questions:If the Qur’an is for humans, and yet Jinn can benefit from it, is it a universal book for all intelligent beings?Alternatively, is there a lost or hidden revelation specifically for the Jinn?How does Islamic theology explain the moral guidance of the Jinn prior to Muhammad’s time?Could there have been prophets or scriptures specifically for Jinn that are unmentioned or lost?The silence of the Qur’an on these matters opens the door for speculative theology but also underscores potential inconsistencies within Islamic revelatory logic.4. Did the Jinn Say the Shahada? Who Is Their Rasul?Islamic orthodoxy affirms that entry into Islam requires reciting theShahada:“There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is His Messenger.”The Jinn inSurah al-Jinnare said to have “believed” upon hearing the Qur’an. But:Did they formally declare the Shahada?Is Muhammad their rasul (messenger)?Or did they accept the Tawheed (monotheism) but without embracing Muhammad’s prophethood?If Muhammad is their messenger, how can this be reconciled with their separate ontological category as beings made from fire, existing outside of direct human society?This brings forth the critical issue:Is Muhammad theuniversal prophet, including over angels and Jinn, or is his message primarily anthropocentric?5. Contemporary Interactions: Do Muslims Interact with Jinn Today?Various traditions within Islam—particularly Sufi and folk Islam—contain accounts of Muslim scholars and saints interacting with Jinn. Some scholars are said to have taught Islam to Jinn or led them in prayer. In contrast, orthodox Islamic theology generally discourages attempts to summon or interact with Jinn due to the risk of engaging with deceitful or malevolent beings.Questions for modern inquiry:Do Jinn read the Qur’an or attend mosques?Do they perform the five pillars of Islam?How do Jinn establish their own ummah and jurisprudence?Can a human scholar issue fatwas for Jinn?Hadiths such as those inSahih MuslimandTafsir Ibn Kathirdiscuss Jinn listening to the Qur'an and speaking with the Prophet, but again, these remain isolated and ambiguous reports.6. The Problem of Doctrinal Consistency: Contradiction or Mystery?If every nation has its own prophet and book (Qur’an 35:24; 10:47), and if Jinn are morally accountable, then the Qur’anic silence on their specific messengers or books seems theologically inconsistent.Is this a contradiction? Or an area of divine mystery?Does the absence of a Jinn prophet in Islamic scripture represent a contradiction in divine justice?Or does it suggest that Muhammad's prophethood is so expansive that it includes both realms—seen and unseen?If Muhammad is the universal messenger, why was his da’wah to Jinn indirect and passive rather than intentional and specific?7. Conclusion: Open Questions and Areas for Further StudyThe topic of Muslim Jinn invites more questions than answers and remains an underexplored area in Islamic theology. For theologians, scholars, and students of comparative religion, this topic challenges assumptions about:The boundaries of prophethoodThe universality of divine guidanceThe consistency of God’s justice across different beingsUntil further Qur’anic exegesis or Hadith analysis resolves these tensions, the theological identity of the Muslim Jinn remainsambiguous,debated, andrich for scholarly discourse.Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteContact:info@shimbatheology.org",

Drawing onSahih Bukhari,Tabaqat Ibn Sa'd, and Qur’anic verses such as Surah Al-Haqqah (69:44–47), this study seeks to assess whether Muhammad’s own words and the circumstances surrounding his death align with the Quranic standard for true prophethood or provide internal evidence pointing to false prophecy.IntroductionThroughout history, the legitimacy of prophetic claims has been subject to both internal and external tests. The Quran presents a litmus test for authentic prophets: they must not fabricate revelations in the name of Allah. If they do, divine retribution is promised. This paper examines the death of Muhammad as described in canonical Islamic texts and raises the question—did Muhammad’s own death by poison fulfill the Quran’s divine criteria for exposing a false prophet?1.Context: The Poisoning at KhaybarAccording toTabaqat Ibn Sa'd(vol. 2, pp. 249–252), a Jewish woman in Khaybar attempted to poison Muhammad after the Muslim conquest of her community. She offered poisoned meat, explicitly stating her motive:“I wanted to see if you were a prophet. If you are, it would not harm you. If not, I would relieve the people from you.”(Tabaqat Ibn Sa'd, p. 249)This statement frames the event as a divine test—a challenge that the Prophet’s survival would vindicate his divine protection and legitimacy, whereas death would signify divine rejection.2.Quranic Criteria for a False Prophet: Surah Al-Haqqah 69:44–47The Quran itself issues a stern warning to anyone who might fabricate revelations:“And if he had made up about Us some [false] sayings, We would have seized him by the right hand, then We would have cut from him the aorta (jugular vein). And none of you could prevent Us from doing so.”(Quran 69:44–47)This verse establishes a standard: if Muhammad were a false prophet, Allah would personally ensure his death by cutting hisaortaorjugular vein—a physical, painful form of divine judgment.3.Muhammad's Own Confession Before DeathThree years after the poisoning incident, during his terminal illness, Muhammad himself drew a connection between his suffering and the poisoned meat:\"O Aisha! I still feel the pain caused by the food I ate at Khaybar, and at this time, I feel as if my aorta is being cut from that poison.\"(Sahih Bukhari, Vol. 5, Book 59, Hadith 713)A nearly identical statement is recorded inTabaqat Ibn Sa'd(p. 252):“The Messenger of Allah lived for three years after that until the poison made him so ill that he died… now I feel that the time has come for my jugular vein to be cut.”Muhammad’s own declaration, using the precise phrase “cutting of the jugular vein,” mirrors the terminology in Quran 69:46.4.Scholarly AnalysisIf we apply the Quranic criteria rigorously, this confession raises serious theological implications:Language Symmetry: The Quranic warning (“cut his jugular vein”) is precisely mirrored in Muhammad’s deathbed words.Theological Irony: The very test that the Jewish woman posed—whether the poison would affect a true prophet—was seemingly confirmed by Muhammad's prolonged suffering and eventual death.No Miraculous Healing: Unlike biblical prophets who were divinely healed or delivered, Muhammad succumbed to the poison over time, which calls into question the traditional claim of prophetic immunity.5.Conclusion: Internal Evidence for False Prophethood?From within Islamic sources themselves, an argument can be made that Muhammad failed the Quranic test laid out for authentic prophecy. His death by poison and his personal reference to the cutting of his jugular vein appear to fulfill the Quran’s own stated criteria for divine judgment against a false prophet.Such internal inconsistencies—when weighed alongside the explicit Quranic and Hadith testimonies—support the critical position that Muhammad’s death by poisoning is not merely a historical footnote, but a theological indictment. This analysis invites Muslims and non-Muslims alike to reconsider the prophetic claims of Muhammad in light of Islam’s own sacred texts.ReferencesThe Quran, Surah Al-Haqqah (69:44–47)Sahih Bukhari, Volume 5, Book 59, Number 713Tabaqat Ibn Sa'd, vol. 2, pp. 249–252Guillaume, A.

    "full_content": "Title: A Comparative Analysis of Women’s Empowerment in Israeli and Muslim SocietiesThe status and roles of women in the Middle East differ significantly across national and cultural boundaries. One notable contrast exists between the societal roles of women in Israeli society and those in several predominantly Muslim nations such as Gaza, Syria, and Jordan. These differences can be seen in spheres such as military participation, legal rights, cultural expectations, and religious interpretations.InIsraeli society, women have played an active and visible role in national life, particularly throughcompulsory military service. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) require most Jewish women to serve for at least two years, placing them in roles ranging from combat to intelligence (Lemish & Barzel, 2000). It is not uncommon to see young women in uniform, armed with rifles, even in casual public spaces such as cafés and parks. This image reflects a broader social and legal acceptance of women's autonomy and agency in matters of national security. As one IDF commander once put it, “Our women carry life in one hand and weapons in the other to defend it” (Magen, 2014).By contrast, manyMuslim-majority societiesmaintain more traditional and patriarchal views of gender roles, often influenced by conservative interpretations ofIslamic jurisprudence (fiqh). In such societies, women are frequently encouraged or required to prioritize domestic roles—childbearing, childrearing, and caretaking—while adhering to strict dress codes such as theburqaorniqab(Mernissi, 1991; Cooke, 2001). Though some women embrace these norms as expressions of piety and identity, others view them as restrictions on their personal and civic freedoms.Islamic texts have been interpreted in various ways with regard to gender. For instance,Qur'an 4:34speaks of men as \"protectors and maintainers of women,\" a verse that some traditional scholars interpret as legitimizing male authority and even corporal discipline under certain conditions. This verse, along with hadith literature, has been central in shaping many Islamic legal systems concerning marriage, guardianship, and obedience (Engineer, 2008). However, Islamic feminists and reformist scholars challenge such interpretations, arguing for egalitarian readings that reflect the Qur’an's broader ethical call for justice and compassion (Barlas, 2002).Meanwhile, Israeli women are trained from a young age not only in self-defense but in leadership and technological competence. Many go on to hold prominent positions in government, business, and science (Herzog, 2004). Conversely, in some conservative Muslim settings, girls are still socialized primarily for domestic roles, with limited access to quality education and public decision-making opportunities (UN Women, 2020). This disparity in training and social expectations contributes to a sharp contrast in how empowerment is understood and embodied.Nevertheless, it is essential to acknowledge thediversity of experiences among Muslim women. While restrictive norms exist in some regions, many Muslim-majority countries have made significant progress in promoting women’s education, healthcare access, and political participation. Nations such as Tunisia, Indonesia, and Morocco have implemented progressive reforms, and Muslim women globally have emerged as leaders in academia, activism, and politics (Moghadam, 2004).In summary, the symbolic image of an Israeli woman casually carrying an M16 while enjoying a coffee contrasts sharply with the image of a traditionally dressed Muslim woman engaged in childrearing and domestic duties. This contrast reflects deeper differences in thesocial, legal, and religious frameworksthat shape gender roles in different societies. While the Israeli model emphasizes military readiness and civic equality, certain conservative Islamic frameworks promote modesty and male guardianship as religious virtues. These differences merit careful scholarly analysis rather than simplistic generalizations.ReferencesBarlas, A.

As believers, we rejoice whenever anyone confesses Christ as Lord, whether of high or low intellect, for the gospel is the power of God unto salvation to all who believe (Romans 1:16). However, let us be clear: the divinity of Jesus Christ is not validated by human intelligence, no matter how extraordinary. Truth is not subject to IQ scores; it is grounded in divine revelation.Throughout history, many great minds have embraced the Christian faith—Augustine, Pascal, Newton, and others—not because their intellect proved Christ’s deity, but because the Spirit of God opened their hearts to the truth of the gospel. Similarly, many intellectuals have rejected Christ, for as Scripture declares, “the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him” (1 Corinthians 2:14). The gospel transcends human reasoning; it is spiritually discerned.Mr. Kim’s testimony, while encouraging, should not be treated as evidence of Christ’s divinity, but as a witness to the reality that even the most brilliant minds are not beyond the reach of God’s grace. Jesus is not Lord because the world’s smartest man says so; He is Lord because He rose from the dead (Romans 1:4), fulfilled prophecy (Isaiah 53; Daniel 9), and is exalted at the right hand of the Father (Hebrews 1:3). His deity is a revealed truth, affirmed by Scripture, declared by the apostles, and sealed in the hearts of believers by the Holy Spirit.Let the church not be swayed by celebrity confessions or intellectual endorsements, but by the enduring truth of the Word of God. The confession that “Jesus is Lord” remains a miracle of grace, not a product of intellect. For as Jesus Himself said, “flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in heaven” (Matthew 16:17).—Dr. Maxwell Shimba",

    "full_content": "The Silence of the Garden: A Parable of Withered Innocence and the Ethics of Child Protection in Religious ContextsDr. Maxwell ShimbaUSA Theological University, Orlando, FLAbstractThis article presents and analyzes a parable—The Silence of the Garden—as a theological and ethical allegory confronting child exploitation sanctioned or overlooked within certain religious contexts, particularly in some interpretations of Islamic jurisprudence. Through symbolic language, the narrative critiques the manipulation of sacred texts, the failure of religious guardianship, and the consequences of institutional silence on the innocence of children. The article draws upon theological ethics, child rights frameworks, and reformist Islamic scholarship to advocate for a renewed commitment to justice, particularly the protection of children from harmful traditions rooted in patriarchal and historical legal norms. By reframing religious silence not as consent but as complicity, the article argues that ethical integrity demands an unambiguous denunciation of harmful practices—regardless of religious or cultural origin.1. IntroductionReligious communities across the world hold moral and spiritual authority in high esteem, often entrusting clerics, scholars, and traditions with guidance over social conduct and familial structures. However, when religious authority is invoked to justify the violation of the vulnerable—especially children—it becomes necessary to scrutinize such frameworks with both theological integrity and ethical urgency. The parable“The Silence of the Garden”functions as a literary-theological critique of the ways in which innocence can be sacrificed at the altar of unexamined tradition and unchecked authority.This article engages the parable as a case study in moral theology, drawing attention to the defense of child marriage and other forms of abuse through religious texts. It places particular focus on interpretations within Islamic jurisprudence, while recognizing that such ethical lapses are not exclusive to Islam, but shared across many religious histories. The parable thus becomes a tool for advocacy: a quiet scream for reform in the name of justice, dignity, and divine compassion.2. The Parable as Ethical AllegoryIn the parable, the “garden” represents a moral community, vibrant and full of promise, yet subject to decay not from nature, but from internal betrayal. The “flowers” are children, vulnerable and reliant on caregivers for protection and nourishment. The “guardians” are figures of religious authority, who instead of nurturing, exploit. What begins as metaphor soon reveals itself as a critique of child abuse facilitated or ignored by religious institutions.The silence referenced throughout is not merely the absence of protest—it is symbolic of societal complicity. Parents silencing their children, theologians defending harmful practices, and communities protecting religious reputations over justice all contribute to the withering of the garden. The parable’s power lies in its moral clarity: “Silence is not consent. The Book may not mention every evil, but that does not bless its existence.”3. Scriptural Silence vs. Ethical AccountabilityOne of the parable’s key theological insights is its challenge to the logic that “what is not prohibited is permitted.” This interpretive method, common in some pre-modern jurisprudence, can be used to justify actions not explicitly condemned in sacred texts. But as theologian Linda Hogan argues,“The silence of scripture must not be mistaken for divine approval”(Hogan, 2003, p. 77).In Islam, for instance, debates around the Prophet Muhammad’s marriage to Aisha (reported to have been consummated when she was around nine years old) have led some traditional jurists to allow child marriage under Sharia. Yet modern Islamic scholars such as Dr. Khaled Abou El Fadl and Dr. Kecia Ali argue that such historical acts must be read within their sociocultural context and cannot be transplanted uncritically into contemporary legal and moral frameworks. As Abou El Fadl asserts:“To accept child marriage today as legitimate under Islam is to deny the Qur’anic emphasis on mercy, justice, and dignity”(Abou El Fadl, 2001, p. 245).4. Child Marriage, Islamic Law, and Reformist DiscourseWhile many Islamic legal schools technically allow marriage upon physical signs of puberty—sometimes as early as age nine—there is growing consensus among reformist Muslim scholars and human rights advocates that such permissions conflict with the moral trajectory of the Qur’an and the modern understanding of childhood. Organizations such as Musawah and Sisters in Islam have called for re-evaluation of classical fiqh in light of contemporary knowledge and ethical standards.The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989), ratified by most Muslim-majority countries, defines a child as a person under 18 and explicitly condemns all forms of sexual exploitation and harmful traditional practices, including child marriage (Articles 19, 24, 34). The persistence of such practices in religious communities thus poses not only a theological challenge, but a legal and humanitarian one.5. The Moral Cost of SilenceAs the parable narrates, “Not all flowers bloom again once crushed.” The psychological, emotional, and spiritual trauma experienced by children subjected to early marriage or abuse under religious sanction often results in long-term damage. The silence of religious leaders, parents, and communities—whether born of fear, reverence, or apathy—is a breach of moral responsibility.Christian scripture echoes this warning in the words of Jesus:“If anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea”(Matthew 18:6, NIV). Similarly, the Qur’an places strong emphasis on justice (`adl), protection of the weak (Surah An-Nisa 4:75), and the ethical treatment of orphans and children (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:220).6. Toward a Theology of Protection and JusticeThe time has come for religious communities to move from denial to confession, from complicity to courage. Sacred texts must be interpreted through the lens of divine justice, not archaic patriarchy. Theological ethics demands not only what is permissible, but what is righteous.The prophetic call is not to defend the status quo, but to protect the powerless. In every tradition, the protection of children is a sacred trust. The “garden” can only thrive if the cries of the saplings are heard, honored, and defended.7. ConclusionThe Silence of the Gardenis not just a parable—it is a prophetic mirror held up to religious communities. It exposes the quiet complicity that allows injustice to masquerade as tradition, and calls for an urgent reclamation of theological ethics centered on compassion, justice, and the inviolable dignity of the child.The garden still has hope. But hope begins with truth—and truth begins with breaking the silence.ReferencesAbou El Fadl, K. (2001).Speaking in God’s Name: Islamic Law, Authority and Women. Oneworld Publications.Ali, K.

While acknowledging the historical context of 7th-century Arabia, the article evaluates the enduring influence of this precedent in Islamic jurisprudence and its incompatibility with contemporary ethical, psychological, and human rights standards. A comparative reflection is drawn with Judeo-Christian traditions to underscore a broader discourse on prophetic morality, child protection, and the evolution of ethical norms in modern civilization.IntroductionReligious traditions have historically shaped moral paradigms, yet not all ancient practices withstand the scrutiny of contemporary ethical standards. One such contested practice is child marriage, particularly within Islamic tradition where it is recorded that the Prophet Muhammad consummated a marriage with Aisha when she was nine years old (Sahih al-Bukhari, 5133). While this event is often contextualized within 7th-century Arabian norms, its ongoing justification in parts of the Muslim world raises significant ethical concerns in light of modern legal and psychological understanding. This article interrogates this practice from a multidisciplinary standpoint—religious history, psychology, child development, and international human rights—to assess its moral standing today.Historical Context and Islamic JurisprudenceAccording to Sunni canonical hadiths (e.g.,Sahih al-BukhariandSahih Muslim), Aisha was six years old at betrothal and nine at the time of consummation (al-Bukhari, 5133; Muslim, 1422a). Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) traditionally permits marriage upon the onset of puberty, with some schools considering consummation acceptable at or even before this threshold, if permitted by a guardian (wali). Classical scholars like Al-Shafi‘i and Ibn Qudamah accepted this norm, interpreting the Prophet’s conduct as eternally valid.However, this view reflects cultural realities of pre-modern tribal societies that lacked contemporary scientific understanding of childhood, adolescence, or neurodevelopment. In such contexts, survival imperatives and social structures normalized early marriage to secure tribal alliances or progeny. Yet invoking these precedents today to validate child marriage undermines both moral progress and scientific consensus on child welfare.Scientific and Psychological FrameworkModern developmental psychology and neuroscience have drastically altered our understanding of childhood. Studies by the World Health Organization (WHO, 2018) and the American Psychological Association (APA, 2020) confirm that individuals below 18 lack the neurological and emotional maturity required to make informed marital or sexual decisions. The prefrontal cortex, governing moral reasoning and impulse control, remains underdeveloped until approximately age 25 (Steinberg, 2013). Furthermore, early sexual activity correlates with trauma, depression, PTSD, and adverse physical health outcomes, including increased maternal and infant mortality (UNICEF, 2022).Therefore, from a scientific standpoint, child marriage is neither developmentally appropriate nor medically safe. It violates not only individual health but foundational principles of consent and autonomy.Ethical and Legal ConsiderationsFrom an ethical viewpoint, child marriage is a form of structural violence and coercion. Philosophers like Immanuel Kant, who emphasized the inviolable dignity of the human person, would categorically reject such practices. In modern legal frameworks, child marriage constitutes statutory rape, irrespective of cultural or religious justifications. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), ratified by nearly all nations, defines a child as anyone under 18 and urges states to protect children from sexual exploitation and forced marriage (UNCRC, 1989).Moreover, institutions like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International continue to denounce child marriage as a gross human rights violation, especially where religious justifications are used to bypass state laws or international conventions. Thus, any perpetuation of such practice today, whether grounded in religious texts or not, stands in violation of both human rights law and moral reason.Comparative Perspective: Christianity and Prophetic MoralityIn the Judeo-Christian tradition, patriarchs such as Abraham, David, and Solomon engaged in polygamy and maintained concubines. However, contemporary Christian theology does not regard these figures as moral exemplars in the context of marriage or sexual ethics. Rather, their actions are interpreted as descriptive of historical culture, not prescriptive of divine morality. Jesus Christ, who is held as the sinless moral exemplar in Christian theology, neither married nor engaged in polygamy, and His teachings emphasize monogamy, mutual respect, and the protection of the vulnerable (Matthew 19:4–6).Islamic theology, by contrast, treats Muhammad asuswa ḥasana(\"the perfect example\") whose actions are often considered binding. This theological position makes ethical evaluation of his conduct not merely historical but normative. Therefore, if a figure is believed to be divinely guided and morally exemplary, yet engages in behavior that modern consensus deems harmful—such as child marriage—then the legitimacy of that claim must be critically re-evaluated in light of both historical context and contemporary ethics.ConclusionThe enduring veneration of practices like child marriage based on religious precedent poses a profound ethical dilemma in the modern era. While historical context may explain such actions, it does not morally justify their perpetuation today. Religious traditions must be subject to critical scrutiny, especially when their prescriptions conflict with universal principles of human dignity, psychological health, and legal standards of child protection. To uphold the marriage of a minor—such as a 9-year-old—as morally exemplary is to regress from centuries of moral and legal progress. In modern civilization, the standard for moral authority must be anchored not in historical literalism but in an unwavering commitment to human rights and the protection of the most vulnerable.ReferencesAl-Bukhari, M.

Through a comparative exegetical approach, the study highlights how both traditions associate physical covering with shame, honor, and sacredness. It further scrutinizes the paradox in Islam where symbols associated with shame in the biblical context are institutionalized as marks of piety and sanctity, thereby examining the ideological transformation and religious reappropriation of symbols across religious traditions.1. IntroductionThe act of covering—be it of the body or of sacred spaces—has always held a profound place within Abrahamic religious thought. Genesis 38:15 presents a vivid narrative that associates the act of veiling with prostitution and deception, while in Islam, veiling is presented as a symbol of modesty and religious virtue. Simultaneously, the Kaaba, Islam’s most sacred site, is covered in black cloth, inviting comparison with the black veil often worn by Muslim women. This paper investigates the tension between the biblical understanding of covering as an act linked with shame and deception, and the Islamic reinterpretation of the same as an emblem of piety and sanctity.2. Genesis 38:15 – Veiling and ProstitutionGenesis 38:15 states:“When Judah saw her, he thought she was a harlot; because she had covered her face.”(KJV)In this passage, Tamar, Judah's daughter-in-law, disguises herself as a prostitute by veiling herself, prompting Judah to mistake her identity. The text implies a cultural norm in which women who covered themselves—especially in public—could be identified with harlotry, at least under suspicious circumstances. The covering here is a tool ofdeceptionandsexual ambiguity, serving as a visual marker that confounds identity and invites sexual transaction.This narrative reflects an early Near Eastern view that associates facial veiling with specific social roles—particularly harlotry. Thus, covering is not a neutral act but one imbued with societal expectations and moral connotations. The veil hides, protects, or manipulates identity, depending on context, and is not inherently virtuous.3. The Islamic Veil and its Transformation of SymbolismContrary to the implications of Genesis 38:15, Islamic tradition elevates the practice of veiling to a religious command rooted in modesty (haya) and honor. The Quran prescribes covering for believing women in Surah An-Nur (24:31) and Surah Al-Ahzab (33:59), emphasizing that women should draw their garments over themselves to be recognized as respectable and to avoid harassment.The black veil—niqab,hijab, orabaya—serves multiple religious and sociopolitical functions: identity affirmation, communal belonging, religious obedience, and social modesty. The theological inversion is striking: what was once a symbol of shame and sexual deception in Genesis is transformed into a religious obligation and badge of honor in Islam.This transformation is not merely interpretive but ideological. The veil is reappropriated, stripped of its biblical associations with sin and deception, and vested with spiritual purity and obedience. The Islamic veil thus becomes a tool for counter-narrative: reclaiming what once represented disgrace as a form of sanctity and dignity.4. The Kaaba and the Black Cloth: A Sacred CoveringThe Kaaba in Mecca, Islam’s holiest site, is annually draped in a black silk cloth known as theKiswah, inscribed with verses from the Quran in gold thread. This practice is considered an act of veneration, conferring sacredness and majesty upon the structure.From a biblical perspective, the color black and the act of covering are often associated with mourning, concealment, or judgment (cf. Lamentations 4:8; Joel 2:6). In Islamic practice, however, the black cloth becomes an emblem of divine majesty and unity. Again, we witness a symbolic reversal: blackness and covering, which carry connotations of darkness, sin, or disgrace in biblical literature, are invested with honor and sacredness in Islam.The theological irony cannot be overstated. A symbol of human shame and deception in Genesis—black covering—is now used to veil the house of Allah and the bodies of Muslim women alike.5. The Similitude of Shame: Between Biblical Symbolism and Islamic RitualThe covering in Genesis 38:15 was used deceptively and brought about moral scandal. In contrast, Islam institutionalizes the covering of both persons and places as acts of moral uprightness. However, this raises a critical theological and anthropological question: Does Islam merely invert symbols, or does it fundamentally misinterpret the moral universals embedded in earlier scriptures?Islam, while claiming continuity with Judeo-Christian tradition, seems to recontextualize symbols without reconciling their original meanings. The veil, once a tool of prostitution and disguise, is turned into a sign of religious fidelity. The black cloth that may connote sin and obscurity now wraps the most sacred Islamic site.This juxtaposition leads us to ask:Is Islam a continuation, distortion, or contradiction of the Abrahamic tradition it claims to uphold?The covering becomes a simulacrum—an image detached from its original reference—adopted and re-signified.6. Conclusion: Symbolism and Sacred MisappropriationThe theological dissonance between Genesis 38:15 and Islamic covering practices reveals a deeper hermeneutical chasm. The veil, and the black cloth, once associated with concealment and moral ambiguity, are appropriated in Islam as sacred and pure.This paper suggests that Islam does not preserve the original moral symbolism of covering but inverts it, transforming what was shameful into a religious obligation. The simulacrum of sanctity built upon inverted biblical symbols reflects Islam’s broader pattern of theological appropriation—adopting Judeo-Christian imagery while emptying it of its original moral context.As such, thesimilitude of shamein both traditions is not merely symbolic, but evidential of a deeper theological divergence. What the Bible calls deception and shame, Islam calls modesty and sacredness. The question remains: can truth and falsehood be cloaked in the same garment?BibliographyHoly Bible, King James Version.

A Theological and Logical Inquiry into the Finality of ProphethoodBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba | Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractIslamic theology insists that Muhammad is the final prophet, the “Seal of the Prophets” (Khatam an-Nabiyyin). This doctrine is foundational to Islam and is affirmed in the Qur’an in Surah Al-Ahzab 33:40. However, multiple Islamic traditions (Hadith and exegeses) suggest the eschatological return of Isa bin Maryam (Jesus, son of Mary), not merely as a righteous follower but as aruling judge and prophet-like figure, raising profound theological and logical challenges. If Muhammad is the last prophet,what exactly will Isa be upon his return?If Isa still holds a prophetic role,has the Quran contradicted itself by declaring Muhammad as the final prophet?This paper explores the apparent paradox and raises critical academic and theological questions aimed at stimulating scholarly debate within Islamic and interfaith studies.IntroductionThe doctrine of the finality of prophethood is central to Islamic belief. Surah Al-Ahzab 33:40 clearly states:“Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but he is the Messenger of Allah and the Seal of the Prophets (Khatam an-Nabiyyin).”This verse has historically been interpreted by the majority of Muslim scholars to mean thatno prophet will come after Muhammad. Yet, Islamic eschatology—through both Hadith and tafsir literature—asserts thefuture return of Isa bin Maryam (Jesus), who will descend from heaven, defeat the Dajjal (Antichrist), and rule the earth in justice.Thus arises the central contradiction:If Muhammad is the final prophet, what prophetic authority—if any—will Jesus exercise upon his return?Key Quranic and Hadith SourcesQur’an 33:40– Affirms Muhammad as the Seal of Prophets.Qur’an 4:157–159– States that Jesus was not crucified, but was raised up to Allah and will return.Sahih al-Bukhari (Book 55, Hadith 657)– Says that Jesus will descend as a just ruler and break the cross.Sahih Muslim (Book 1, Hadith 293)– \"There is no prophet between me and him [Jesus] and he shall descend.\"This last hadith particularly raises theological tension. If no prophet stands between Muhammad and Jesus, then does Jesus retain his prophetic status after Muhammad? And does his descent notrevive the institution of prophethood after Muhammad’s era, violating the principle of finality?Core Theological Questions and ContradictionsDoes the Quran contradict itself by declaring Muhammad as the last prophet, yet affirming the eschatological return of a former prophet?Is Isa bin Maryam stripped of his prophetic role upon return? If so, where is this clearly stated in the Quran or Hadith? If not, then does his return constitute a prophetic reactivation?Can a prophet return and function as a judge and religious leader without exercising prophethood? If so, how is this different from his previous prophetic mission?If Isa’s return involves religious leadership and issuing judgments in accordance with divine guidance, how does that not constitute prophethood?If Muhammad is the final prophet, how do we interpret Jesus’ return in light of Surah Al-Ahzab 33:40? Is there an exception clause that the Quran or Allah omitted or forgot?Is Isa bin Maryam’s second coming essentially a loophole in the theology of finality? If Allah is omniscient, why make a definitive finality claim knowing Jesus would return?Will Isa receive divine revelation upon return, or act solely based on earlier teachings? If he receives new guidance, is that not revelation, and thus a resumption of prophethood?Islamic Responses and Critical EvaluationIslamic apologistsoften argue that Jesus will not return as a prophet but as afollower of Muhammad, thereby not violating the doctrine of finality. However, this explanation raises its own set of contradictions:If Jesus returns as a follower, does he cease to be a prophet? Can a prophet ever stop being a prophet once ordained by God?If Jesus will lead prayers, judge disputes, and execute divine law, is this not thefunctional essence of a prophet’s role, regardless of formal title?If Isa will break crosses and correct Christian theology, how is that not a new mission—thus new prophethood?This approach appears to diminish the original authority of Isa bin Maryam while simultaneously using him as a divine agent in end-time theology. This inconsistency reflectsa theological patchwork rather than coherent divine planning.A Debate of Divine Logic: Allah’s Oversight or Intentional Contradiction?Let us consider two possibilities:Scenario 1: Allah declared Muhammad as the last prophet, fully aware Isa would return as a prophet.Then Allah intentionally createda contradictionbetween Quran and Hadith, misleading generations of Muslims about the true nature of finality.Scenario 2: Allah forgot or overlooked Isa’s return when revealing Quran 33:40.Then the omniscience of Allah iscalled into question, implying divine forgetfulness or inconsistency.Either scenariodamages the internal consistencyand theological coherence of the Quran.ConclusionThe return of Isa bin Maryam as both a religious judge and a righteous leaderposes serious theological dilemmasfor the Islamic claim that Muhammad is the final prophet. The Qur’an affirms Muhammad’s finality, yet the Hadith affirms Isa’s return—a former prophet returning to act in what appears to be a prophetic capacity. EitherIslam must admit Isa is the final prophetby virtue of his return, or concede that thedoctrine of finality is compromised by exception, leading to divine inconsistency.This contradiction invites further theological scrutiny. If Isa can return and function in prophetic authority,how final was Muhammad's finality?If not a prophet, then what will Isa be—a demoted messenger? A spiritual judge with no divine office?Suggested Areas for Further Research and DebateComparative analysis with Christian eschatology: Does Jesus return in a different office in both religions?Philosophical implications of divine inconsistency.Role of Hadith versus Quran in shaping Islamic doctrine.Analysis of classical tafsir literature on Jesus’ second coming.By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaFounder, Shimba Theological InstituteTheologian, Apologist, Researcher",

The narration claims that Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and his companions consumed the meat of a wild boar during a time of exhaustion and hunger. This paper investigates the hadith’s content, chain of transmission, theological implications, and compatibility with Islamic dietary law (ḥalālandḥarāmdistinctions).IntroductionIslamic jurisprudence (fiqh) draws heavily from two foundational sources: the Qur'an and the Hadith (sayings and actions of Prophet Muhammad). The Qur'an explicitly forbids the consumption of pork (Surah al-Baqarah 2:173, Surah al-Ma'idah 5:3, Surah al-An'am 6:145). Therefore, any narration that claims the Prophet of Islam consumed pork raises significant theological and historical questions.The narration in question is reportedly recorded by Al-Tabar and transmitted via Ibn Ali Bakouri, who attributes it to a statement of ‘Aisha, the wife of the Prophet, regarding an incident in which the Prophet and his companions, after a long journey, allegedly consumed wild boar meat at the house of a woman named Fatimah.The Hadith Text and TranslationArabic Original (As Quoted):والحديث رواه الطبر ، وردَّه ابن علي بكوري ، فسمع أصحاب رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم يقولون: سئم نبي الله وأصحابه من السفر الطويل. وصلوا إلى بيت فاطمة صديقة رفاقها. قال رسول الله: هل عندك ما تأكل؟ أجابت فاطمة بنعم. فسأل رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم إذا كان لك فريسة. فاطمة تجيب عندي خنزير بري. فأكل نبي الله وأصحابه لحم الخنزير البري حتى شبعوا.English Translation:The hadith is narrated by Al-Tabar and received by Ibn Ali Bakouri, who heard the companions of the Prophet of Allah say: The Prophet of Allah and his companions were weary from a long journey. They arrived at the house of Fatimah, a friend of their companions. The Prophet asked, \"Do you have anything to eat?\" Fatimah replied, \"Yes.\" The Prophet asked again, \"Do you have any prey?\" Fatimah answered, \"I have a wild boar.\" Then the Prophet of Allah and his companions ate wild boar meat until they were full.Textual and Source AnalysisUpon preliminary review, several red flags emerge:The Source – Al-Tabar:The reference to “Al-Tabar” is ambiguous. It is unclear whether the author refers to Al-Ṭabarī (the famous 9th-century historian and exegete) or another lesser-known narrator. No such hadith is found in Al-Ṭabarī’sTārīkh al-Rusul wa al-Mulūkor hisTafsīr. The name “Ibn Ali Bakouri” is also absent from any well-known isnād (chain of narration) records among Sunni or Shi'a traditions.Contradiction with Qur'anic Law:The Qur’an forbids the consumption of pork unequivocally (Qur’an 2:173; 5:3; 6:145; 16:115). Even in situations of necessity (darura), the Qur’an allows eating what is forbidden only when there is no alternative and when it is done out of survival, not desire (2:173). However, the tone of the narration here lacks the severity or desperation of such a context.Isnād and Matn Critique:This hadith does not appear in any of the six major hadith collections (Sahih Bukhari, Sahih Muslim, Sunan Abu Dawood, Sunan al-Tirmidhi, Sunan al-Nasa’i, Sunan Ibn Majah), nor does it appear in knownda‘if(weak) compilations. The isnād (chain of narrators) is both obscure and unverifiable, thus failing the criterion ofsahih(authentic) or evenhasan(acceptable).Terminology and Anachronism:The use of the phrase \"wild boar\" (khinzīr barrī) is highly unusual in classical Arabic hadith literature. Moreover, the name “Fatimah,” while common, may imply a conflation with Fatimah al-Zahra (daughter of the Prophet), which further complicates the narrative.Theological and Doctrinal ImplicationsIf accepted as authentic, this narration would directly contradict the Prophet’s teachings and Qur’anic revelation. However, Islamic theology maintains that the Prophet was protected (ma‘sūm) from sin and from violating divine law knowingly. The consumption of pork—wild or domesticated—is strictlyḥarām. To suggest the Prophet did otherwise undermines both his prophetic authority and the integrity of the Qur’anic revelation.ConclusionUpon textual, contextual, and theological scrutiny, this narration must be classified asfabricated (mawdū‘)orinauthentic. It is unsupported by any reliable chain of transmission and stands in stark contradiction to foundational Islamic teachings. It may represent a later polemical insertion or a forgery designed to provoke controversy.Scholars and students of comparative religion must approach such claims with academic rigor and a critical eye toward historical methodology, isnād science, and theological coherence.ReferencesThe Qur'an: Surah al-Baqarah 2:173, Surah al-Ma'idah 5:3, Surah al-An'am 6:145, Surah al-Nahl 16:115Al-Ṭabarī,Tārīkh al-Rusul wa al-Mulūk, ed.

    "full_content": "Was Muhammad Really Illiterate? A Critical Examination of the Traditional Islamic ClaimBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteAbstractOne of the most widely asserted claims in Islamic theology is that Prophet Muhammad was illiterate, and that this illiteracy serves as proof of the divine origin of the Qur’an. This paper critically evaluates the historical, linguistic, and hadith-based evidence surrounding this claim. It also questions the theological implications of asserting Muhammad’s illiteracy as a miracle, demonstrating that both the premise and the conclusion are flawed. Further analysis is provided on the interpretation of the Arabic termummiyy(ٱلْأُمِّيّ) and its contextual meaning, including a re-examination of hadiths that suggest Muhammad was capable of reading and writing.1. IntroductionMuslims commonly argue that the illiteracy (ummiyy) of Prophet Muhammad is miraculous, positing that the literary excellence of the Qur’an could not have originated from an unlettered man. This reasoning, however, presumes two unverified claims: first, that Muhammad was indeed illiterate in the strict sense of being unable to read or write; and second, that the Qur’an was revealed in a purely oral form without any textual interaction by Muhammad. This paper questions both claims.2. The Traditional Understanding of 'Ummiyy' (ٱلْأُمِّيّ)In Islamic theology, Surah 7:157 refers to Muhammad asal-nabiyy al-ummiyy(ٱلنَّبِيُّ ٱلْأُمِّيُّ), usually translated as \"the unlettered Prophet.\" However, the Arabic termummiyydoes not unambiguously mean “illiterate.” According toEdward William LaneinAn Arabic-English Lexicon(1863, p. 92),ummiyycan also mean\"gentile\", especially when contrasted with Jewish or scriptural communities. This is supported by Surah 62:2, which describes Muhammad as being sent “to theummiyyīn,” often interpreted as “to the gentiles.”“It is He who has sent among the unlettered [ummiyyīn] a Messenger from themselves…”(Qur’an 62:2, Sahih International).Thus, a textual-linguistic analysis suggests thatummiyymay refer to Muhammad’s lack of scriptural background (non-Jewish), rather than a lack of literacy. The conflation ofummiyywith “illiterate” lacks strong philological support.3. Hadith Evidence Questioning Illiteracy3.1 Treaty of Hudaybiyyah (Sahih al-Bukhari 2699)One of the strongest arguments against Muhammad’s illiteracy arises during the drafting of the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah. The hadith inSahih al-Bukhari(2699) records that the Prophet instructedAli to strike out the phrase *“Messenger of Allah”* after the Quraysh objected. WhenAli refused, Muhammad is said to have taken the treaty and made the change himself:“So Allah's Messenger took the document and wrote…”(Sahih al-Bukhari, 2699)This moment contradicts the belief that Muhammad could neither read nor write. If he personally modified a treaty document, that indicates at least rudimentary literacy.3.2 Final Illness and Request for Writing Tools (Sahih al-Bukhari 114; Sahih Muslim 1637a)During Muhammad’s final illness, he is reported to have requested writing materials to leave a directive for his followers:“Bring me a pen and paper so I may write for you a statement after which you will not go astray.”(Sahih al-Bukhari, 114;Sahih Muslim, 1637a)Although the Prophet’s request was interrupted and unfulfilled, the hadith strongly suggests his intent to write personally, undermining the assumption that he was incapable of writing.4. Theological Implications and Logical FallacyMuslim apologists often argue that the Qur'an's existence as a literary work authored by an illiterate man is evidence of divine origin. However, this reasoning is circular and self-defeating:First, it presupposes illiteracy as fact.Second, it assumes that human literacy or illiteracy limits divine inspiration.Third, it ignores the Qur'an’s posthumous compilation by literate scribes like Zayd ibn Thabit and others under Caliphs Abu Bakr and Uthman.If Muhammad merely received and orally transmitted divine revelation, then his literacy status becomes irrelevant to the Qur’an’s composition. Furthermore, reliance on a claim of illiteracy to validate divine origin ignores better theological criteria, such as truthfulness, historical accuracy, and moral coherence.5. ConclusionThe claim that Muhammad was illiterate is not conclusively supported by linguistic analysis or early Islamic sources. The use ofummiyyin the Qur’an likely refers to non-Jewish background rather than illiteracy. Additionally, key hadiths suggest Muhammad could read and write. Therefore, Muhammad’s supposed illiteracy should not be considered evidence for the divine origin of the Qur’an.ReferencesLane, Edward William.An Arabic-English Lexicon.

    "full_content": "WERE THESE EXTRAORDINARY TRAITS OF MUHAMMAD PROPHETIC?By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionMany Muslims uphold Muhammad as the final and most exemplary prophet of God, whose character and actions reflect divine revelation. However, a critical and historical analysis of Islamic texts reveals a troubling picture. This paper investigates whether certain controversial traits and actions attributed to Muhammad align with the qualities expected of a true prophet of God. The findings are drawn directly from canonical Islamic sources and contrasted with Christian theological perspectives.1.Muhammad’s Involvement in Adultery with a Slave GirlAccording toTafsir Ibn Kathir(Vol. 6, p. 367), Muhammad was found by his wife Hafsa engaging in intimate relations with her Coptic maidservant, Mariyah. Hafsa reportedly rebuked him harshly. In response, Muhammad promised not to engage with the slave girl again.Question:Is it consistent with prophetic character to be caught in such a scandal within one’s household?2.Muhammad and Prostitution AllegationsSunan Abu Dawud, Book 38, Hadith 4458, narrates that Muhammad sent Ali to punish a male companion who had sexual relations with a female slave owned by Muhammad without his permission. Ali found the girl bleeding, indicating recent intercourse. Muhammad instructed that she not be punished until she healed.Observation:The very ownership of sex slaves and managing their sexual engagements calls into question the prophetic integrity as understood in biblical standards.3.Muhammad and Alleged Homosexual BehaviorInHadith 16,245, narrated by Muawiya ibn Abu Sufyan, it is claimed that Muhammad sucked on the tongue and kissed the lips of his grandson Al-Hassan. This was followed by the assertion that whoever Muhammad did this to would not be punished in hellfire. Similar narrations claim he did so to Ali during illness.Critical Reflection:Such intimate acts, especially justified with spiritual reward, raise moral and theological concerns regarding the nature of prophetic purity and propriety.4.Muhammad and Alcohol ConsumptionInSahih Muslim3753, it is reported that Muhammad asked for and drank strong wine, which led to intoxication.Query:How could a prophet, whose followers are later forbidden alcohol, justify being intoxicated himself? Is this reflective of divine conduct?5.Muhammad’s Affliction with Magic and SorcerySahih Bukhari, Vol. 4, Book 54, Hadith 490 and Vol. 7, Book 71, Hadith 658, report that Muhammad was bewitched to the point of delusion. Tafsir by Sheikh Abdullah Saleh Al-Farsy (pp. 977–978) also recounts this incident.Theological Dilemma:If sorcery is condemned as kufr (disbelief), how could God allow His prophet to be overpowered by it? Was the magic from Allah or from outside forces? What prophet in biblical history was ever bewitched in such a manner?6.Muhammad's Uncertainty About His Eternal FateInQur’an 46:9, Muhammad is quoted as saying:“Say: I am not something original among the messengers, and I do not know what will be done with me or with you. I only follow that which is revealed to me.”Implication:A prophet of God uncertain about his salvation and that of his followers stands in sharp contrast to Jesus Christ, who declared with authority:“I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” (John 14:6)7.Satan Allegedly Converts to IslamAccording to a claim inThe Origin of Jinn(p. 20), Muhammad is reported to have converted Satan to Islam.Theological Question:How can the sworn enemy of God—Satan—be considered a Muslim? If this is true, then Islam becomes the only religion where Satan is accepted as a believer.Final ReflectionsThese accounts raise serious theological and moral concerns about the legitimacy of Muhammad’s prophethood. According to both biblical standards and general moral reasoning, the life and character of a prophet should reflect holiness, consistency, and moral clarity. In contrast, Muhammad’s biography—according to Islamic sources—shows inconsistencies, moral failures, and spiritual confusion.Key Theological Questions for Muslims:(a) If sorcery is a form of disbelief, what is the connection between Allah and magic if He allowed His prophet to be bewitched?(b) Were the witches who bewitched Muhammad Muslims or pagans?(c) Was the magic inflicted on Muhammad sanctioned by Allah or from an opposing force?(d) Which other prophet in religious history was ever bewitched and deluded?(e) Which prophet was unsure of his own salvation and the fate of his followers?Conclusion: Why Follow a Prophet With Demonic Traits?Considering the above, one must ask:Why abandon Jesus Christ—the Way, the Truth, and the Life—for a prophet whose own conduct and confessions contradict divine holiness and certainty?“...while we wait for the blessed hope—the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ.” (Titus 2:13)Come to Jesus, the Living Savior and the True God.Blessings to you all.Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

A Theological and Historical AnalysisAuthor:Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Servant of Jesus Christ, the Great God (Titus 2:13)Shimba Theological Institute, New York, NYAbstractSome Islamic apologists claim that Muhammad was prophesied in the New Testament, specifically in the Gospel of John (chapters 14–16), as the \"Helper\" or \"Comforter\" (Greek:Paraklētos), also known as the Holy Spirit. This article critically examines these claims by analyzing the biblical text and historical Christian interpretation. It demonstrates that such assertions are inconsistent both with the internal biblical evidence and with traditional Islamic theology.IntroductionA recurring claim among some Islamic scholars and da’wah proponents is that theParaklētos—translated as \"Helper\" or \"Comforter\" in the Gospel of John—refers to the prophet Muhammad. This interpretation, however, diverges from both Christian theological understanding and the internal coherence of the Gospel narrative. The relevant passages in question are John 14:16–26, 15:26, and 16:5–15.This paper provides a theological rebuttal to such claims and outlines why theParaklētosmust be identified as the Holy Spirit, not Muhammad, as understood consistently throughout Christian history.Scriptural Analysis: Gospel of John 14–16The relevant passages read:John 14:26– “But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, He will teach you all things...”John 15:26– “When the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father—the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father—He will bear witness about me.”John 16:13–14– “When the Spirit of truth comes... He will glorify me, for He will take what is mine and declare it to you.”Inconsistencies with the Islamic InterpretationIf these passages were truly about Muhammad, then logically Muslims would need to affirm the following five propositions:Muhammad glorified JesusJohn 16:14: “He will glorify me.”Yet, in Islam, Jesus is considered a prophet subordinate to Muhammad, not glorified above him.Muhammad was sent by God in Jesus’ nameJohn 14:26: “...whom the Father will send in my name.”No Islamic teaching affirms that Muhammad was sent in Jesus' name.Muhammad was sent by JesusJohn 16:7: “...for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you.”Islam does not teach that Muhammad was sent by Jesus, which would imply Jesus’ divine authority over Muhammad.Muhammad took from Jesus’ knowledge and made it knownJohn 16:15: “All that the Father has is mine; therefore I said that He will take what is mine and declare it to you.”Islam does not claim that Muhammad relied on the teachings or revelation of Jesus for his message.Muhammad dwelt within the disciplesJohn 14:17: “...He dwells with you and will be in you.”Muhammad, a human prophet, did not spiritually indwell anyone, whereas the Holy Spirit is described as indwelling believers.Thus, for the Islamic interpretation to be valid, Muslims would have to accept a Christology and pneumatology inconsistent with Islamic doctrine.Historical TestimonyBefore the Council of Nicaea (325 A.D.), early Church Fathers had already identified theParaklētosas the Holy Spirit. For instance,Archelaus of Mesopotamia(c. 262–278 A.D.) in hisDisputation with Manes(ch. 34–35, pp. 208–209) clearly refers to the Helper as the Holy Spirit.This interpretation predates Islam by centuries and shows no evidence that Christians understood this prophecy to refer to a future human prophet.Scholarly ReferencesGeisler, Norman L., and Ron Rhodes.When Cultists Ask: A Popular Handbook on Cultic Misinterpretations.Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Books, 1997, pp. 182–183.Geisler, Norman L., and Thomas Howe.When Critics Ask: A Popular Handbook on Bible Difficulties.Wheaton, IL: Victor Books, 1992, pp. 419–420.Archelaus.The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes, inAnte-Nicene Fathers, vol. 6. Edited by Alexander Roberts and James Donaldson.ConclusionThe claim that Muhammad is theParaklētosof John 14–16 is theologically untenable and historically unsupported. The internal logic of the Gospel of John, the consistent witness of early Christian writers, and the contradictions with Islamic doctrine all point to the identification of theHelperas the Holy Spirit, not a future prophet. Consequently, any serious theological reflection must reject the Muslim reinterpretation as an anachronistic and doctrinally flawed imposition on the New Testament text.Shalom,Dr. Maxwell ShimbaServant of Jesus Christ, Our Great God and Savior (Titus 2:13)Shimba Theological InstituteNew York, NY",

Surah 4:82 asserts that a divine scripture must be without discrepancy, and Islamic commentators have historically reinforced this view. However, a closer textual analysis reveals problematic inconsistencies—most notably in the Qur’an’s designation of multiple individuals as the \"first Muslim.\" This paper will examine the claim of internal consistency in the Qur’an through theological, textual, and logical lenses, presenting a critical analysis of whether such contradictions undermine the Qur’an’s divine origin.IntroductionOne of the foundational claims of Islamic theology is the Qur’an’scomplete internal coherenceand divine authorship. The Qur’an states:Surah 4:82“Do they not consider the Qur’an (with care)? Had it been from other than Allah, they would surely have found therein much discrepancy.”This verse has been widely interpreted by classical and modern Islamic scholars as a definitive proof of the Qur’an’s inerrancy.Tafsir Ibn Kathircomments that the Qur’an contains no inconsistencies or contradictions because it is a revelation from \"the Most-Wise, Worthy of all praise.\" Similarly,Yusuf Aliinterprets the verse to affirm the Qur’an’s divine authorship on the basis of its coherence across time, subjects, and contexts.The Islamic Claim of Qur'anic ConsistencyThe assertion of coherence is central to Islamic apologetics. Yusuf Ali, in his commentary, claims:“The Qur’an claims to be a revelation from Allah, and the challenge is that if it were from any other source, it would contain many inconsistencies and contradictions, which no one can deny in any human composition. But in the Qur’an, no such inconsistencies exist.”This argument implies that even a single contradiction within the Qur’anic text would serve as evidence against its divine origin.A Case Study: Who Was the First Muslim?An instructive example of apparent inconsistency lies in the Qur’an’sidentification of the \"first Muslim\", a title that seems to be attributed to multiple individuals:1.Muhammad as the First MuslimSurah 39:12–“And I (Muhammad) am commanded to be the first of those who bow to Allah in Islam.”Surah 6:163–“No partner hath He: this am I commanded, and I am the first of those who bow to His will.”2.Moses as the First BelieverSurah 7:143–“When Moses recovered, he said: ‘Glory be to Thee! To Thee I turn in repentance, and I am the first to believe.’”3.Abraham as the First MuslimSurah 2:132–“And this was the legacy that Abraham left to his sons, and so did Jacob; ‘Oh my sons! Allah hath chosen the Faith for you; then die not except in the Faith of Islam.’”This raises a fundamental contradiction:How can three distinct individuals, living centuries apart, all be described as the \"first Muslim\"?Theological ImplicationsFrom a theological standpoint, this contradiction is not merely semantic. The Qur’an is assertingpriority in faith and submissionto God—a foundational identity marker in Islam. The termMuslim(one who submits to Allah) is used retroactively for pre-Islamic prophets, yet simultaneously, Muhammad is declared thefirstto submit.Islamic scholars have attempted to resolve this by suggesting that each figure was the “first Muslim”in their own time, but this interpretation is not textually grounded in the Qur’an itself. The Qur’an does not qualify these statements with temporal clauses. Each verse makesan absolute claim.Logical and Hermeneutical ConcernsFrom a hermeneutical perspective, the claim of \"firstness\" in multiple contexts without clarification leads tological incoherence. If the Qur’an was revealed by an all-wise, all-knowing deity, such semantic confusion should not exist, especially in a book whose clarity is constantly emphasized (Surah 12:1; 16:89).Moreover, this inconsistency directly challenges the claim of Surah 4:82. Ifeven onecontradiction exists in the Qur’anic narrative, then—by the Qur’an’s own standard—it wouldnotbe from Allah.ConclusionThe assertion that Muhammad, Moses, and Abraham were each the \"first Muslim\" presents atextual contradictionin the Qur’an. According to Surah 4:82, the presence of contradiction indicates that the text cannot be from God. Thus, this specific inconsistency undermines the Qur’an’s claim of divine authorship and perfect consistency.While Muslims maintain that the Qur’an is a flawless and inerrant revelation, critical textual analysis—when conducted with intellectual honesty and academic rigor—reveals that this claim does not withstand scrutiny. Further study is needed to assess whether these inconsistencies are isolated anomalies or indicative of broader textual and theological fragmentation.Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteOrlando, Florida",

Yet, careful analysis of the Qur’anic text reveals apparent inconsistencies, particularly in the mode and timeline of its revelation. This article examines one such contradiction—whether the Qur’an was revealed all at once or gradually over time—and evaluates its implications for the doctrine of inerrancy.Introduction: The Qur’an’s Test of ConsistencyIslamic theology maintains that the Qur’an's lack of contradiction is proof of its divine origin. The Qur’an declares:Surah 4:82“Do they not consider the Qur’an (with care)? Had it been from other than Allah, they would surely have found therein much discrepancy.”This verse serves as an internal test for divine authorship. Islamic scholars, both classical and contemporary, have emphasized the Qur’an’s uniformity as a hallmark of its authenticity. However, any observable contradiction would, by this criterion, undermine the Qur’an’s claim of being the literal Word of God.The Discrepancy in the Revelation TimelineA critical inconsistency arises concerninghow and when the Qur’an was revealed. The Qur’an appears to assertboththat it was revealed all at onceon a specific night, and that it was revealedgradually over time.1. Revelation in a Single Night – The “Night of Power”The Qur’an repeatedly emphasizes that the entire revelation occurred on a specific, blessed night:Surah 97:1–“Indeed, We sent it [the Qur’an] down during the Night of Decree.”Surah 44:3–“Indeed, We sent it down during a blessed night. Indeed, We were to warn [mankind].”These verses clearly indicate acomplete revelationon a specific night, understood by Muslim tradition asLaylat al-Qadr(the Night of Power) during Ramadan.2. Gradual Revelation Over TimeIn contrast, other passages affirm that the Qur’an wasrevealed in stages, spanning years:Surah 17:106–“(It is) a Qur’an which We have divided (into parts), that you might recite it to the people over time. And We have sent it down progressively.”This verse, among others, affirms that the Qur’an was revealedpiecemeal, in direct response to situations during Muhammad’s prophetic ministry over 23 years.Theological and Hermeneutical TensionThis presents atextual contradiction. Was the Qur’an revealedin a single night, as Surahs 97 and 44 explicitly state? Or was it revealedgradually over decades, as Surah 17:106 and Islamic historiography attest?Muslim commentators often attempt to reconcile this by suggesting that the Qur’an waspre-revealedin its entirety to the “Preserved Tablet” (al-Lawh al-Mahfuz) or to the “lowest heaven” on the Night of Power, and then revealed in portions to Muhammad over time. However, this interpretation isextra-Qur’anic—it relies on later theological developments, not on the Qur’anic text itself. The Qur’andoes not mentionthis two-step process.From a hermeneutical standpoint, this introducesambiguityand undermines the Qur’an’s repeated claim to beclear and detailed(Arabic:mubīn, see Surah 12:1; 16:89).Contradiction in Light of Surah 4:82Returning to the Qur’an’s own standard:“Had it been from other than Allah, they would have found in it much discrepancy.”(Surah 4:82)The above contradiction—concerning the method and timeline of revelation—is not semantic or metaphorical. It is adirect conflictbetween two claims, both assertinghowthe Qur’an was delivered to humanity. Such a contradiction challenges the Qur’an’sinternal test of divine origin.ConclusionThis analysis has highlighted a fundamental inconsistency in the Qur’an’s account of its own revelation: whether it was sent down in one night or revealed gradually over time. This is not a trivial matter of interpretation but strikes at the very foundation of the Qur’anic claim to divine origin and consistency.If the Qur’an sets its own standard for authenticity—complete internal consistency—then this contradiction must be addressed. According to Surah 4:82, such a discrepancy would be evidence that the Qur’an isnotfrom Allah. As such, this inconsistency provides a serious theological and textual challenge to the doctrine of Qur’anic inerrancy.Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteNew York, NY",

Had it been from other than Allah, they would surely have found therein much discrepancy.\"— Surah 4:82This verse presents a challenge to the reader: examine the Qur’an, and if contradictions are found, its divine origin is invalidated. Classical Islamic scholars have reiterated this as an apologetic stance affirming the Qur’an’s perfection.Forgiveness of Sins: A Theological Inconsistency?The specific issue under scrutiny in this analysis concerns the Qur’an’s statements regarding divine forgiveness. Does Allah forgive all sins without exception, or are there sins He categorically does not forgive?Affirmation: Allah Forgives All SinsOne passage strongly emphasizes universal forgiveness:\"Say, O My servants who have transgressed against themselves [by sinning], do not despair of the mercy of Allah. Indeed, Allah forgives all sins. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful.\"— Surah 39:53This verse has been frequently quoted to promote the Qur’anic message of hope and mercy. The language here is inclusive:“Allah forgives all sins.”It presents divine forgiveness as comprehensive and unconditional for the repentant.Limitation: Allah Does Not Forgive Shirk (Associating Partners with Him)In contrast, other passages limit this forgiveness:\"Indeed, Allah does not forgive association with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills. And he who associates others with Allah has certainly gone far astray.\"— Surah 4:116\"Allah forgiveth not that partners should be set up with Him; but He forgiveth anything else, to whom He pleaseth...\"— Surah 4:48These verses explicitly state an exception:Shirk(polytheism or associating others with Allah) is unforgivable unless the person repents before death. The implication is clear — while many sins can be forgiven,shirkis treated as categorically different and, in the absence of sincere repentance, is unforgivable.A Theological TensionThis leads to a theological tension. Surah 39:53 appears to affirm thatall sinscan be forgiven without exception. However, Surahs 4:48 and 4:116 introduce an exception that directly contradicts the former’s absoluteness.Muslim apologists and exegetes (e.g., Al-Tabari, Al-Qurtubi, Ibn Kathir) have attempted to resolve this issue by interpreting Surah 39:53 as applying only to sins committed beforeshirkor only to those who repent prior to death. However, the phrase “Allah forgives all sins” in 39:53 is unqualified, making the restriction introduced later appear inconsistent unless read with heavy interpretive framing.ConclusionThe juxtaposition of these verses introduces a genuine interpretative difficulty for the doctrine of divine forgiveness in the Qur’an. If the Qur’an claims that it contains no contradiction (Surah 4:82), then the universal declaration of forgiveness in 39:53 appears incompatible with the conditional exclusion found in 4:48 and 4:116.Whether this constitutes a theological inconsistency or a nuance in divine justice remains a matter of perspective. From an academic standpoint, however, this serves as a legitimate example of internal tension within the Qur’anic text, calling into question its claim of absolute consistency.",

This belief is not merely a theological position but one embedded in the Qur’an itself:Surah 4:82–“Do they not then reflect on the Qur'an? Had it been from other than Allah, they would have found therein much contradiction.”(Yusuf Ali)This claim forms a central pillar of the Qur'an’s argument for divine authorship. According to this verse, any meaningful contradiction within the text itself would undermine the assertion that the Qur'an originates from God. In this segment of our ongoing series, we turn our attention to descriptions of the food in Hell (Jahannam) to examine whether multiple and differing portrayals present a case of internal contradiction.Subject of Investigation: The Nature of Food in HellThe Qur'an offers vivid imagery of the torments awaiting those consigned to Hell, including descriptions of the sustenance provided therein. However, these descriptions are varied and, arguably, conflicting.1. Bitter Thorny Plant (Dhaari‘)Surah 88:6–“No food will there be for them but a bitter Dhari’.”The term “Dhari’” has been interpreted by classical commentators (e.g., Ibn Kathir, Al-Jalalayn) as referring to a thorny desert plant—dry, bitter, and inedible. Some exegeses interpret it as the poisonous plant known as al-Shubruq.2. Corrupted Pus from WoundsSurah 69:36–“Nor hath he any food except the corruption from the washing of wounds.”This disturbing description—variously translated as \"filthy pus\" or \"discharges from wounds\"—represents an entirely different and grotesque kind of sustenance.Surah 69:31(contextual background):“Burn him in the blazing Fire.”This precedes the mention of the pus, suggesting that punishment includes more than fire—there is also detestable nourishment.3. Devilish Fruit from the Tree of ZaqqumSurah 37:64–66–“For it is a tree that springs out of the bottom of Hellfire: The shoots of its fruit-stalks are like the heads of devils: Truly they will eat thereof and fill their bellies therewith.”Here, the food of Hell is said to come from the tree ofZaqqum, a recurrent symbol in Islamic eschatology. Its fruit is described in demonic imagery, emphasizing spiritual as well as physical torment.Analysis of the DiscrepancyThe central issue lies in the Quran presenting multiple, seemingly exclusive descriptions of the only food available in Hell. IfSurah 88:6declares that “no food will there be except bitter thorny plants,” how canSurah 69:36claim instead that the food consists ofpus? Moreover, how does the tree ofZaqquminSurah 37integrate with these accounts?There are three interpretive options, each with theological implications:Literal Exclusivity: If taken literally and exclusively, these verses cannot all simultaneously be true unless different groups in Hell receive different forms of torment. However, this explanation is not present in the Qur'anic text itself and thus requires extrapolation not explicitly supported.Metaphorical Reading: Some commentators propose metaphorical interpretation—Dhari’,Zaqqum, andpusall symbolize intense suffering rather than being literal foods. While plausible, this undermines the vividness and specificity of the descriptions, which are otherwise presented in concrete terms.Cumulative Punishment: Another apologetic attempt suggests acumulativemodel—each description represents one facet of Hell’s torment, applied variously to different sinners. However, this again assumes something not stated in the texts that use exclusivist phrasing such as“no food except…”Theological ImplicationsIf the Qur’an claims, per Surah 4:82, that divine authorship implies absence of contradiction, and yet it exhibits conflicting descriptions of the same eschatological reality, one must ask whether these contradictions are reconcilable without significant eisegesis (reading into the text).While one might argue that literary or thematic diversity does not amount to contradiction, the specificity and exclusivity of the language in these verses suggest more than poetic variety. The claim of“no food except…”logically negates alternatives unless multiple groups are being described—something the Qur'an itself does not clarify in these contexts.ConclusionWhile the type of food in Hell may seem doctrinally minor, the implications are weighty. If the Qur’an presents mutually exclusive descriptions of the same phenomenon without qualification, and if it states that such contradictions would prove the text is not divine, then this becomes a theological and philosophical problem.Final Assessment: The varying depictions of Hell’s food in Surahs 88:6, 69:36, and 37:64–66 constitute atextual inconsistencyunless heavily reinterpreted. According toSurah 4:82, this opens the Qur'an to legitimate critical scrutiny regarding its claim of divine origin.Prepared by:Dr. Maxwell ShimbaSenior Fellow in Comparative ScriptureShimba Theological Institute, New York, NY",

    "full_content": "Title: An Academic Critique of Internal Contradictions in the Quran with Reference to Eschatological Descriptions of Hell’s SustenanceAuthor: Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractMuslim apologists frequently assert that the Quran is of divine origin based on its internal consistency. This claim is derived from verses such as Surah 4:82, which challenges readers to identify discrepancies as a test of divine authorship. However, a critical literary and theological analysis of the Quran’s eschatological descriptions—particularly regarding the food of Hell—raises important questions concerning internal coherence. This article investigates the multiplicity of descriptions concerning Hell's sustenance in the Quran and assesses whether such variances constitute theological contradictions or can be explained as thematic diversity. The findings contribute to the broader discourse on the Quran’s divine claim of inerrancy and consistency.1. IntroductionThe Quran explicitly states in Surah 4:82:“Do they not reflect upon the Qur'an? If it had been from other than Allah, they would have found within it much contradiction.”(Quran 4:82, Sahih International)This verse has been pivotal in Islamic apologetics, serving as a self-verifying test of divine origin. Muslim scholars have historically contended that the absence of contradiction in the Quran is evidence of its perfection and divine authorship (Al-Tabari,Tafsir al-Tabari; Al-Qurtubi,Al-Jami’ li Ahkam al-Qur’an).Nonetheless, when examining the Quran's descriptions of Hell and its inhabitants' conditions, apparent inconsistencies arise—particularly regarding the sustenance of the damned. This article focuses on these inconsistencies to determine whether they breach the Quran’s self-imposed test of inerrancy.2. Descriptions of Food in Hell: A Textual AnalysisThree primary passages describe what the inhabitants of Hell will consume:2.1 Bitter Thorny Plant –Dhaari’Surah 88:6:“No food will there be for them but a bitter dari’.”The term “dari’” refers to a thorny desert plant, commonly identified withAl-Shubrum, which is both inedible and harmful (Ibn Kathir,Tafsir al-Qur'an al-Azim).2.2 Pus from Wounds –GhislinSurah 69:36:“Nor hath he any food except the corruption from the washing of wounds.”The wordghislinis interpreted by many exegetes (e.g., Al-Jalalayn) as a fluid composed of bodily excretions or pus, indicating extreme degradation.2.3 Fruit of the Tree of ZaqqumSurah 37:64–66:“For it is a tree that springs out of the bottom of Hellfire. The shoots of its fruit-stalks are like the heads of devils. Truly they will eat thereof and fill their bellies therewith.”The tree of Zaqqum, often interpreted as a symbol of spiritual and physical corruption, offers a grotesque image of nourishment (Al-Qurtubi,Tafsir, vol. 15).3. Theological and Logical ImplicationsFrom a purely theological standpoint, each of these descriptions could be interpreted metaphorically to signify various stages or types of punishment. However, the language employed is not explicitly metaphorical. Instead, it describes the physical act of eating, suggesting literal experiences in the afterlife.3.1 Contradiction or Multiplicity?Islamic apologists often argue that these are not contradictions but complementary descriptions (Al-Razi,Mafatih al-Ghayb). Yet, the Quranic text offers these descriptions in the context of exclusivity:“No foodwill there be for thembuta bitter thorny plant” (88:6)“Norhath he any foodexceptcorruption from wounds” (69:36)The Arabic terms“illa”(except) and“laisa lahu ta’am illa”(he has no food except) emphasize exclusivity and mutual exclusion. This raises a hermeneutical dilemma: how can multiple exclusive foods coexist in a logically coherent description of eschatological reality?3.2 The Failure of the Quran’s Internal Test?Given that Surah 4:82 offers a self-imposed falsifiability test—i.e., the presence of any contradiction would negate its divine origin—the co-existence of mutually exclusive descriptions challenges the claim of perfect consistency. Scholars such as W.M. Watt (1961) and John Wansbrough (1977) have long noted that literary tension and chronological layering within the Quran may reflect evolving redaction rather than singular authorship.4. Comparative Perspective and Scriptural ConsistencyIn contrast, biblical eschatology—though also diverse in metaphor—maintains internal coherence without using absolute exclusive terminology. For instance, descriptions of \"weeping and gnashing of teeth\" or \"lake of fire\" (Matthew 13:42, Revelation 20:14) differ in imagery but are unified in tone and purpose without suggesting mutually exclusive realities.5. ConclusionThe Quran’s descriptions of Hell's sustenance, when examined through the lens of exclusivity and internal coherence, raise significant theological questions. The presence of multiple, mutually exclusive food types—each presented as the only food available—presents a serious challenge to the claim found in Surah 4:82. While theological flexibility and metaphorical readings may offer partial explanations, the linguistic and logical exclusivity embedded in the verses limits interpretive maneuverability.Thus, this case study illustrates how a close, scholarly critique of internal Quranic content may contest the assertion of absolute consistency and divine authorship. It invites further interfaith, philosophical, and textual dialogue regarding the Quran’s nature and origin.ReferencesAl-Tabari,Jāmiʿ al-Bayān ʿan Ta’wīl Āy al-Qur’ān.

It clearly identifies theComforter (Greek:Paraklētos)as theHoly Spirit, who is sent byJesus from the Fatherand whose role is to testify of Jesus. The broader context of John 14–16 affirms that the Comforter is the Spirit of Truth who will dwellinthe disciples (John 14:17), teach them all things (John 14:26), and glorify Jesus (John 16:14).Evaluating the Islamic Claim That Muhammad is the ComforterSome Islamic apologists argue that theParaklētos(Comforter) refers toMuhammad. However, when examined critically, both biblically and historically, this interpretation collapses under scrutiny:Was Muhammad given to the disciples?No. Muhammad was born approximately six centuries after Jesus’ ascension. He was not present in the time of the disciples, nor was he received by them, as the Holy Spirit was on the Day of Pentecost (Acts 2:1–4).Was Muhammad living at the time of the disciples?No. Muhammad lived in the 6th and 7th centuries AD (c. 570–632 AD), whereas the disciples of Jesus lived and ministered in the 1st century.Was Muhammad living inside the disciples?This is an impossibility both biologically and theologically. The Gospel of John 14:17 says of the Comforter, “He dwelleth with you and shall bein you.” No human prophet, including Muhammad, can indwell believers. Only the Holy Spirit, a divine person, has that capacity.Was Muhammad omnipresent?No. Omnipresence is an attribute of deity, not of created beings. Muhammad, as a human prophet in Islam, was not omnipresent. The Holy Spirit, however, is described as present in all believers simultaneously (cf. Romans 8:9–11).Is Muhammad inside Christians?Again, this contradicts both Christian theology and Islamic teaching. Christians believe the indwelling of the Holy Spirit is essential to the new birth (John 3:5; Romans 8:9). Muhammad is not believed by Muslims to indwell anyone.Did Muhammad teach about Jesus?Muhammad acknowledged Jesus in the Qur’an as a prophet and messenger butexplicitly deniedkey aspects of Jesus' identity, such as His divinity (Qur’an 5:72), crucifixion (Qur’an 4:157), and Sonship (Qur’an 19:35). This is fundamentally incompatible with the Comforter's mission, which is to glorify and testify of Christ (John 16:14).Was Muhammad a spirit?No. Muhammad was a man, not a spirit. The Comforter is called theSpirit of truth(John 14:17). Islam never claims Muhammad was a spirit or divine presence.Was Muhammad from the Father?The Comforter is said to \"proceed from the Father\" (John 15:26), which implies eternal origin and divine nature. This language isTrinitarian, affirming the deity and eternal procession of the Spirit. No Islamic theology attributes divine procession from the Father to Muhammad.Is Allah the Father?In Islam,Allah is not considered “Father”in any personal or relational sense (Qur’an 112:3; 5:18). This directly contradicts the New Testament revelation of God as theFather of our Lord Jesus Christ(Ephesians 1:3). Therefore, the God who sends the Comforter in John is the Christian God—theFather, not Allah of the Qur’an.Logical Conclusion: If Muhammad is Claimed to be the Comforter, Then Jesus Is Claimed to Be AllahIf one were to argue—contrary to both Christian and Islamic theology—thatMuhammad is the Comforter, then by necessity of John 15:26, one must also affirm that:Jesus sent Muhammad,Muhammad proceeded from the Father,and Muhammad glorifies and indwells believers.This would make Jesus the sender of a divine being, thereby placing Him in the position ofdivine authority and omnipotence, a status Islam explicitly denies. Therefore, such a claim logically and theologically leads to theaffirmation of Jesus’ divinity—ironically making Jesusequal with God, which contradicts Islamic monotheism (Tawḥīd).ConclusionThe identity of the Comforter as theHoly Spiritis clear in both the immediate and wider biblical context. Attempts to reinterpret this as a prophecy of Muhammad are not only theologically inconsistent but also historically and linguistically unfounded.Shalom,Max Shimba Ministries Org",

The Greek termParaklētos(παράκλητος) is translated as “Comforter,” “Advocate,” or “Helper.” The verse explicitly identifies this figure as“the Holy Ghost” (Holy Spirit)who will:Be sent bythe FatherComein Jesus’ nameTeachall thingsRemindthe disciples of what Jesus saidThe Holy Spirit, therefore, is a divine person within the Trinitarian framework of Christian theology. The Holy Spirit's role isthe continuation of Christ's presenceand teaching among the disciples, not a new prophetic mission that contradicts or supersedes the work of Christ.2. Was Muhammad Sent in the Name of Jesus?To assess whether Prophet Muhammad was sent “in Jesus’ name,” one must evaluate both Islamic and biblical evidence.John 14:26says the Comforter comes\"in my [Jesus'] name.\"This implies representation, continuation, and alignment with Jesus’ teachings and authority.However,nowhere in the Qurandoes Allah state that:Muhammad was sentin the name of Jesus.Muhammad would remind people of the sayings of Jesus.Muhammad's mission was to represent or continue Jesus' ministry.Rather, the Quran declares that Muhammad was sentas a warner to all people(Quran 7:158) and emphasizes hisdistinct prophethood, not one under the authority or name of Jesus.3. Is Allah the Father of Jesus?The Quran emphatically denies thefatherhood of Allahin any sense akin to the biblical understanding:“It is not befitting to (the majesty of) Allah that He should beget a son.”(Quran 19:35)“Say: He is Allah, the One... He begets not, nor was He begotten.”(Quran 112:1–3)In contrast, Christian theology, based on scriptures like Matthew 3:17 and John 3:16, affirms God as theFather of Jesus Christ, both ontologically and relationally. Thus, the divine Father who sends the Comforter in John 14:26cannot be equated with Allahof the Quran, who denies having a son.4. Does the Quran Mention a Comforter Sent by Allah?TheQuran does not mentiona “Comforter” (Paraklētos) or any similar figure described in the Gospel of John.Muslim apologists have historically attempted to claim thatMuhammad is the “Comforter” (Paraklētos)referred to in John 14–16. This is based on a speculative linguistic argument thatParaklētoswas originallyPeriklutos(\"praised one\") and thus refers toAhmad, another name of Muhammad mentioned in Quran 61:6:“Jesus, the son of Mary, said: O Children of Israel! I am the messenger of Allah to you, confirming that which was [revealed] before me in the Torah and bringing good news of a messenger who will come after me, whose name will be Ahmad.”However, nomanuscript evidencefrom the Greek New Testament supports this textual corruption. All known Greek manuscripts readParaklētos, notPeriklutos.Furthermore, the Comforter in John 14:26 is:TheHoly Spirit, not a manSent bythe Father, not by Jesus himselfIndwellingbelievers forever (John 14:16)These attributesdo not fit Muhammad, who was a human prophet who did not indwell believers nor came in Jesus’ name.5. Does the Quran Say Muhammad is a Comforter?No. TheQuran never refers to Muhammadusing the Greek concept ofParaklētos(Comforter, Advocate, or Helper).The Quran uses terms like:“Nadhir”(Warner) – Quran 33:45“Bashir”(Bearer of good news) – Quran 33:45“Abd”(Servant) – Quran 18:1But never does it equate Muhammad with theHoly Spiritor describe his mission in theJohannine termsused for the Comforter.ConclusionThere isno biblical or Quranic basisto identify Muhammad as the Comforter of John 14:26. The Comforter is clearly identified as theHoly Spirit, who proceeds from theFather in the name of Jesus, to continue Christ’s ministry by indwelling believers.Furthermore:Allah is not the Fatherof Jesus in Islam.Muhammad was not sent in Jesus’ name.TheQuran does not mentionany figure equivalent to theParaklētos.TheQuran does not call Muhammad a “Comforter.”Scholarly ReferencesBrown, Raymond E.The Gospel According to John, Anchor Bible Commentary.Köstenberger, Andreas.John, Baker Exegetical Commentary.Ibn Kathir,Tafsir al-Quran al-Azim.Yusuf Ali Translation of the Quran.Qadhi, Yasir.Introduction to the Sciences of the Qur'an.Final Note:Until the Quran explicitly states that Muhammad is a Comforter sent in Jesus' name, by the Father (who must be the Father of Jesus), and fulfills all Johannine descriptions of the Holy Spirit,conversion to Islam on that basis would be ungrounded.Soli Deo Gloria.Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

    "full_content": "A Critical Evaluation of the Sexual Rewards in Islamic EschatologyAbstractIslamic eschatology, as depicted in both the Qur'an and Hadith literature, offers vivid descriptions of Paradise, particularly emphasizing sensual and sexual pleasures for male believers. This paper critically evaluates these portrayals, analyzing Qur'anic verses, classical tafsir (exegesis), and Hadith traditions that promise houris—eternally virgin women—as part of the afterlife reward. It discusses the theological, ethical, and psychological implications of such representations and assesses whether these descriptions reflect divine holiness or exploit carnal desires as a motivational mechanism. The paper argues that these depictions challenge core theological concepts such as divine transcendence, moral consistency, and gender equity.1. IntroductionThe concept of Paradise (Jannah) in Islamic theology is rich with symbolic imagery and metaphysical promises. However, particular attention has been drawn to the sensual rewards offered to male adherents, especially the descriptions of houris—female companions characterized by perpetual virginity, physical beauty, and sexual availability. While many Muslims view these descriptions as metaphoric or allegorical, a literal interpretation dominates both traditional exegesis and popular understanding. This paper seeks to interrogate these portrayals through critical theological and psychological lenses.2. Qur’anic Descriptions of Houris and Physical RewardsThe Qur'an presents Paradise as a garden of eternal pleasure. Among its recurring themes is the promise of houris—female companions whose descriptions focus on beauty and sexual availability. Consider the following:Surah Al-Tur 52:20describes believers “reclining on adorned couches” and being “joined with fair women with large, beautiful eyes” (ḥūr ʿīn).¹Surah Al-Wāqiʿah 56:35–38elaborates: “Indeed, We have produced them [houris] in a new creation and made them virgins, devoted and of equal age.”²Surah Al-Nabaʾ 78:33references “full-breasted companions of equal age” (kawāʿib atrābā).³These verses have often been interpreted literally in early and classical tafsir.Al-Tabari, for instance, explains thatḥūr ʿīnare literal women created with perfect physical features specifically for the pleasure of male believers.⁴ Similarly,Al-Qurtubiconfirms thatkawāʿibrefers to women with “firm, round breasts,” again underscoring the sensual tone.⁵This consistent attention to female physical traits rather than mutual companionship suggests that the Qur’anic portrayal of Paradise, at least for men, is heavily focused on physical and sexual gratification.3. Hadith Literature: Hyperbolic Sexual RewardsThe Hadith corpus, which includes the sayings and traditions of Prophet Muhammad, further amplifies these descriptions with even more explicit details.Sunan Ibn Majah (Hadith 4337)states: “Every man who enters Paradise will be married to 72 wives; two from the houris and seventy from his share of the women of Hell.”⁶Musnad Ahmad (Hadith 13886)reports: “A believer will be given strength equal to one hundred men in terms of eating, drinking, and sexual intercourse.”⁷The medieval scholarAl-Suyuti, in his eschatological and angelological writings, vividly describes houris as pure beings so transparent that “the marrow of their bones can be seen through their flesh.” He adds that after every sexual act, the houris return to a state of virginity, and light shines from their genitals.⁸This level of graphic sensuality not only surpasses the Qur’an’s depiction but elevates the Paradise narrative into what could be perceived as religious erotica. Such depictions invite scrutiny about the nature of divine reward and whether these incentives reflect a spiritual, moral heaven—or a sanctified brothel.4. Theological and Ethical Implicationsa)The Nature of God and Moral IncentivesA central theological issue emerges: can a morally perfect and transcendent God promote righteousness by offering overtly carnal rewards? The depiction of Allah as a divine benefactor of endless sex and pleasure raises questions aboutmoral congruency. The Judaic-Christian vision of Heaven typically emphasizes union with God, spiritual peace, and the shedding of earthly desires. In contrast, the Islamic Paradise, when interpreted literally, seems to repackage theearthly appetites—particularly male sexual desires—into an eternal afterlife format.This leads to the ethical dilemma:Is obedience to God genuine if motivated by lustful reward?b)Gender Imbalance and Female MarginalizationAnother ethical concern lies in thegender imbalanceof Paradise. The Qur’an offers detailed descriptions of women as rewards for men, but little is said about what female believers receive. According toTafsir Ibn Kathir, righteous women will be reunited with their earthly husbands or married to other men in Paradise, but there is no equivalent mention of male houris or sensual reward for them.⁹This raises concerns aboutdivine justiceandequality. How can Paradise be a place of ultimate fairness if its rewards appear tailored to male pleasure at the expense of female agency?5. Psychological and Sociological AnalysisPsychologically, these descriptions may act ascompensatory fantasiesfor adherents living under strict social and sexual norms. By restricting sexuality on Earth but promising unlimited indulgence in the hereafter, the theology creates adelayed gratification systemthat may psychologically manipulate frustrated or vulnerable individuals. The depiction of a hyper-sexualized afterlife, filled with eternal virgins and enhanced male virility, appeals more to fantasy than to moral or spiritual growth.In radical contexts, these depictions have beenweaponized. Extremist groups have used the promise of 72 virgins as a recruitment tool, especially for suicide bombers. AsJessica Sternnotes in her bookTerror in the Name of God, this belief in instant sexual gratification post-martyrdom can serve as a strong motivational driver for disenfranchised youth.¹⁰6. Comparative PerspectiveIn Christian eschatology, Paradise (Heaven) is primarily depicted as aunion with God, a state ofspiritual fulfillment and divine presence(Revelation 21:3–4). Jesus teaches that in the resurrection, people “neither marry nor are given in marriage” but are “like angels in heaven” (Matthew 22:30), implying a transcendence of sexual identity and earthly desires.This contrast underscores a fundamentalphilosophical divergencebetween the Islamic and Christian concepts of the afterlife:corporeal fulfillmentversusspiritual communion.7. ConclusionThe Qur’anic and Hadith descriptions of Paradise, particularly the sexual rewards for male believers, present serious theological and ethical questions. The focus on houris, virginity, physical beauty, and hypersexual male potency seems more reflective ofearthly fantasiesthan divine holiness. These depictions challenge the notion of Paradise as a space of purity, equity, and spiritual elevation. Instead, they raise the possibility that Islam, at least in some interpretative traditions,uses sensual imagery as a means of psychological and ideological persuasion.Ultimately, any concept of divine reward that objectifies women and appeals to base desires should be reexamined through a lens of theological integrity, ethical consistency, and gender justice.BibliographyThe Qur'an, Surah Al-Tur 52:20.

This paper critically examines whether these descriptions align with spiritual ideals or instead reflect a materialistic and corporeal vision that arguably diverges from what is traditionally considered holy or divine.1. Qur’anic Descriptions of Houris (Heavenly Companions)The Quran outlines various rewards for the righteous in Paradise, among which are the so-called \"houris,\" described as beautiful companions with specific physical features. For instance:Surah Al-Tur (52:20)speaks of believers reclining on thrones, paired with companions with “wide and beautiful eyes.”Surah Al-Waqi’ah (56:35-38)goes further, stating that these women are made “new” (i.e., perpetual virgins) and are created specifically for their male partners in Paradise.Surah Al-Naba (78:33)vividly describes these companions as possessing \"full-breasted\" physiques, which many classical and modern commentators interpret as an appeal to male sexual desires.These verses, while interpreted differently among Muslim scholars—some allegorically, others literally—nonetheless contain explicit references to the physical and sexual nature of the rewards.2. Hadith Literature and Hyperbolic Sensual PromisesHadith collections such asSunan Ibn Majah (Hadith 4337)andMusnad Ahmad (Hadith 13886)further elaborate on these rewards. According to these sources:Each believing man is promised72 virgins.These virgins are described asperpetually pure,rejuvenated after each intercourse, and possessing light-filled bodies (cf. the commentary of Jalal al-Din al-Suyuti).Believers are endowed with exaggerated sexual potency—equal tothat of 100 men, and their sexual function is described in terms that modern readers might liken to \"eternal virility\" or \"divine Viagra.\"The explicitness of these descriptions has led to criticism that Islam's portrayal of Paradise appeals tocarnal fantasy rather than spiritual transcendence.3. Ethical and Theological ImplicationsThe theological challenge arises when these promises are compared to the nature of God as a moral lawgiver and spiritual guide. A fundamental question is whether it is appropriate—or even divine—for a deity to incentivize moral obedience with what appear to be overtly sexual rewards. From a philosophical standpoint, the promise of endless sexual gratification in exchange for piety raises the following ethical issues:Moral Incentivization or Sensual Manipulation?Does this depiction uplift the human soul toward transcendence, or does it exploit base desires to gain compliance?Divine Holiness vs. Carnal Marketing:Can a deity maintain moral transcendence while promising what appears to be a sexually indulgent afterlife? Would a loving father reward his son’s righteousness with what essentially amounts to a celestial brothel?Gender Inequality:The descriptions are clearlymale-centric, with little to no equivalent rewards outlined for women, raising further questions about gender justice in Islamic eschatology.4. Psychological InterpretationFrom a psychological perspective, one could argue that these sensual depictions function asmotivational tools, especially for individuals living under sexually repressive conditions. By promisingunattainable pleasuresin the afterlife, the system offers an escapist fantasy that may hold powerful psychological sway over young or sexually frustrated adherents. Such mechanisms are not unique to Islam but can be found in other religious and cultic ideologies throughout history.ConclusionThe sexualized vision of Paradise presented in Islamic texts—whether interpreted literally or metaphorically—raises significanttheological, ethical, and psychological concerns. The notion of divine reward rooted in eternal sensuality may suggest autilitarian model of religion, where obedience is bought not with spiritual fulfillment but with corporeal indulgence. This depiction invites deeper reflection on the nature of God, holiness, and the true essence of eternal reward. In doing so, it challenges us to ask whether such portrayals serve genuine spiritual purposes—or whether they function asreligious marketing, appealing to human instincts more than to divine ideals.",

One such encounter, often referred to in traditional Islamic sources as the Battle of Uhud, depicts the Prophet Muhammad suffering a serious physical assault at the hands of the Quraysh. This analysis will translate and explore the implications of this account.The Event DescribedIn Paragraph 1 of Page 57, Sheikh Farsy narrates that during a major battle between the Muslims and the Quraysh—presumably the Battle of Uhud—the Muslim forces were overwhelmed. The Quraysh launched a fierce counterattack, during which the Prophet Muhammad was physically assaulted. The following injuries are recorded:Muhammad was struck with stones.His teeth were broken.Iron nails (or weapons) were embedded into his cheeks.He lost consciousness and was presumed dead.In response to this attack, his companions rushed him to safety in the hills to protect him from being killed by the advancing Quraysh forces. The cause of this violent confrontation is attributed to Muhammad's mission of converting pagan Arabs to Islam.Dialogue Between Abu Sufyan and the CompanionsParagraph 2 provides an intriguing record of what transpired immediately after the battle. The leader of the Quraysh, Abu Sufyan, called out loudly:“Is Muhammad alive or dead? Is Muhammad alive or dead?”The Prophet instructed his companions not to respond. Abu Sufyan called out again:“Is Abu Bakr alive or dead?”Still, there was no response.Then he asked for the third time:“Is Umar alive or dead?”Again, silence followed.Thinking they had all perished, Abu Sufyan declared:“By Allah, all of them must be dead.”At this point, Sayyiduna Umar, unable to bear the false statement, raised his voice and responded:“All those whom you have mentioned are alive, and they are ready to meet you and your army at any time.”Theological ReflectionThis account invites critical reflection: Where was divine protection at this moment of brutal attack upon the Prophet of Islam? Why would a prophet, said to be the \"Seal of the Prophets,\" be subjected to such physical humiliation—losing his teeth and being presumed dead? Such reflections are common in interreligious debates, especially in Christian-Muslim apologetics, where divine protection over God's messengers is often emphasized.Concluding RemarksWhile Muslim sources present this as a testament to Muhammad’s perseverance and the trials of prophethood, others view the event as problematic when assessing divine providence and prophetic invincibility. The term“kibogoyo”in Swahili (meaning \"toothless\" or \"disfigured\") is used in some interpretations to describe the Prophet's physical condition post-battle, though such descriptors should be approached with scholarly care and respect in academic or interfaith discussions.Translated and Adapted by:Max Shimba Ministries OrgFor theological and historical studies in Islamic-Christian dialogue.",

    "full_content": "Title:A Comparative Theological Analysis of Salvation in Islam and Christianity: A Critical Evaluation of Eschatological CertaintyAuthor:Dr. Maxwell ShimbaAffiliation:USA Theological University, Orlando, FLAbstractThis paper critically examines the eschatological claims and concepts of salvation in Islam and Christianity. Particular attention is given to the uncertainty of salvation in Islamic theology as articulated in the Qur'an, and the contrastive assurance of salvation in Christian soteriology centered on the person of Jesus Christ. Drawing from scriptural texts in both the Bible and the Qur'an, the paper argues for the uniqueness of Christ’s redemptive role and the exclusivity of salvation through Him, while highlighting Muhammad's own uncertainty regarding his final destiny as recorded in Islamic scripture.1. IntroductionReligious beliefs concerning salvation and the afterlife constitute foundational aspects of any theological system. While both Islam and Christianity recognize a final judgment and the concepts of heaven and hell, the doctrines diverge significantly on the means and assurance of salvation. This paper aims to contrast the two perspectives by examining scriptural passages and theological implications within their respective frameworks.2. Muhammad's Uncertainty of Salvation in the Qur'anInQur’an 46:9, the Prophet Muhammad states:\"Say, [O Muhammad], 'I am not something original among the messengers, nor do I know what will be done with me or with you. I only follow that which is revealed to me...'\"(Surah Al-Ahqaf 46:9, Sahih International)This passage reveals a startling theological position: even Muhammad himself was uncertain of his own final outcome, as well as that of his followers. Islamic commentators, such as Al-Tabari and Al-Qurtubi, have offered various interpretations to mitigate this verse’s implications. However, the plain reading conveys a deep uncertainty concerning salvation, even for the Prophet of Islam.Such uncertainty raises an essential question for Islamic soteriology:If the messenger himself is unsure of his final destiny, what assurance is available for ordinary believers?3. The Inevitability of Hell in Islam: Qur'an 19:71Further compounding this theological ambiguity isQur’an 19:71, which states:\"And there is none of you except he will come to it [Hell]; this is upon your Lord an inevitability decreed.\"(Surah Maryam 19:71)While some scholars argue that “coming to it” may refer to merely passing over hell (via the bridge of Sirat), the use of the Arabic term\"wariduha\"(will arrive at it) often implies a literal entry. Several Hadith sources also confirm that even Muhammad feared hellfire and frequently prayed for protection from it.Thus,Islam appears to present no absolute assurance of paradise, instead emphasizing personal deeds, Allah’s mercy, and divine will.4. The Certainty of Salvation in ChristianityIn contrast, Christianity proclaimsguaranteed and personal salvationthrough Jesus Christ.John 14:6records Jesus’ exclusive claim:“I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.”Furthermore,John 3:36states:“Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.”These verses underscore a unique claim within Christianity:salvation is assured for those who believe in Jesus Christ. The New Testament presents eternal life not as a future possibility but as a present possession for believers (cf. John 5:24).5. The Exclusivity of Christ’s Redemptive RoleThe apostolic teaching inActs 4:12affirms the exclusivity of Christ’s role in salvation:“There is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.”This absolute claim distinguishes Christianity from all other religions, including Islam. Unlike Muhammad, who expressed uncertainty about his destiny, Jesus spoke with divine authority and promised eternal security to all who trust in Him.6. Comparative Eschatological EthicsJesus’ words inMatthew 15:14serve as a moral and theological warning:“If the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit.”This metaphor applies fittingly to any religious system whose founder lacks assurance of salvation. A guide who does not know his destination cannot provide confident direction to others.7. ConclusionThe contrast between Islam and Christianity on the subject of salvation is stark and theologically consequential. Islam offers no assurance of eternal life even to its prophet, while Christianity provides certain and secure salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. The invitation of Christ inJohn 10:9remains open:“I am the door. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved.”The implication is clear:To reach heaven, one must follow Jesus. To follow any other path is, by biblical teaching, to risk eternal separation from God.ReferencesThe Qur’an, Surah 46:9; Surah 19:71 (Sahih International).The Bible, John 14:6; John 3:36; Acts 4:12; Matthew 15:14; John 10:9.Al-Tabari,Tafsir al-Tabari, Vol. 26.Al-Qurtubi,Tafsir al-Qurtubi, Surah 19.R.

    "full_content": "The Satanic Verses and the Daughters of Allah in Early Islam: A Scholarly Historical ExaminationIntroductionThe historical records of early Islam reveal a fascinating and controversial incident known as the \"Satanic Verses.\" This event suggests that Prophet Muhammad, at one point, uttered verses acknowledging the intercessory powers of three pagan deities worshipped by the Quraysh:al-Lat, al-Uzza, andManat. These verses were later abrogated and declared to have been inspired by Satan, not Allah. This study examines the historical, theological, and scholarly significance of this incident through Islamic sources.1. The Incident of the Satanic Verses (Gharaniq Story)This event is recorded in early Islamic historiography and supported by various early scholars. According to the narrative, Prophet Muhammad initially recited a verse recognizing the three daughters of Allah as intercessors:“These are the exalted Gharaniq (cranes) whose intercession is hoped for.”This was allegedly revealed after Muhammad recitedSurah al-Najm (53:19–20)which names the three pagan goddesses. The Quraysh rejoiced, believing that their deities had been honored. However, Muhammad later retracted these verses, stating they were not from Allah but whispered by Satan.2. The Three Daughters of AllahPre-Islamic Arabs believed in Allah as the supreme deity, but they also worshipped His so-called daughters:al-Latal-UzzaManatThese were viewed as divine intercessors, and their worship was deeply ingrained in Qurayshi religious practices. Surah al-Najm 53:19-20 mentions them by name:“Have you considered al-Lat and al-Uzza? And Manat, the third – the other one?”(Qur’an 53:19-20)While the current Qur’an rebukes this belief in subsequent verses, early narratives indicate that Muhammad initially affirmed their intercession under satanic influence.3. Classical Islamic Sources Confirming the IncidentThe Satanic Verses incident is affirmed by several early and authoritative Islamic scholars, including:Ibn Ishaq(d. 767/773 CE)— In hisSirat Rasul Allah, the earliest biography of Muhammad.al-Wahidi(d. 823 CE)— In his commentaryAsbab al-Nuzul(Occasions of Revelation).Ibn Sa’d(d. 845 CE)— InKitab al-Tabaqat al-Kabir.al-Tabari(d. 923 CE)— In his monumentalTarikh al-Rusul wa al-Muluk(History of the Prophets and Kings).These scholars unanimously acknowledge the occurrence of the incident, making it difficult to dismiss as fabrication.4. Qur’anic Affirmation of Satan’s InfluenceWhile later Muslim scholarship often denies the authenticity of the Satanic Verses, the Qur’an itself seems to reference this event:Surah 22:52“Never did We send a messenger or prophet before you but when he desired, Satan threw into his desire; but Allah abolishes what Satan throws in, then Allah makes precise His verses.”Surah 17:73-75“And indeed, they were about to tempt you away from that which We revealed to you... And if We had not strengthened you, you would have almost inclined to them a little.”These verses suggest that even prophets can be momentarily misled by satanic influence, though ultimately corrected by God.5. Rebuttals and ResponsesSome modern Muslim apologists attempt to reject this incident based on various grounds:Weak or unverified isnad(chain of narration)Absence from Sahih Hadith collectionslike Bukhari or MuslimTheological incompatibilitywith the doctrine of prophetic infallibility (ʿisma)However, responses to these objections include:The chains are multiple and traced to early sources close to Muhammad’s era.Many early Muslim historians accepted the story without hesitation.The incident is cited to explain the revelation of Qur’an 22:52.Rejecting the incident due to discomfort is not a scholarly approach, especially when early sources affirmed it.6. Theological ImplicationsIf the incident is authentic, several significant implications arise:Doctrinal Integrity:The prophetic claim of uncorrupted divine revelation is questioned.Prophetic Infallibility:If Muhammad could speak Satan’s words, even briefly, it undermines the claim of absolute prophetic purity.Biblical Contrast:The Bible claims that true prophets never utter false prophecy (Deut. 18:20–22). In contrast, this incident would render Muhammad—however briefly—a false prophet.ConclusionThe Satanic Verses incident is not merely a myth fabricated by critics, but a historical event affirmed by early Islamic authorities. It reveals a significant moment where Muhammad allegedly delivered a revelation from Satan, only to retract it later. Whether one is a Muslim, Christian, or academic historian, this event warrants serious attention due to its profound theological consequences.ReferencesIbn Ishaq,Sirat Rasul Allahal-Tabari,Tarikh al-Rusul wa al-Mulukal-Wahidi,Asbab al-NuzulIbn Sa’d,Kitab al-Tabaqat al-KabirQur’an: 22:52, 17:73–75, 53:19–20",

An Investigation into Islamic and Biblical Teachings on MagicBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Max Shimba Ministries OrgAbstractThis paper explores the controversial claim that the Quran contains teachings of sorcery and that such teachings are endorsed by Allah. Drawing from Quranic verses, particularly Surah Al-Baqarah 2:102, as well as biblical injunctions against witchcraft, the article critically assesses whether Islamic sources promote the use of sorcery. Furthermore, the study investigates the theological implications of this claim in contrast with Judeo-Christian ethics on witchcraft. The article concludes with a biblical apologetic perspective rooted in monotheistic orthodoxy.1. IntroductionWitchcraft and sorcery have long been sources of fear and fascination across cultures and religions. In both African traditional religions and global spiritual contexts, magic is often seen as a force capable of harming, controlling, or manipulating human affairs. Within this discourse, an emerging theological question arises:Does the Quran condone or teach sorcery?More specifically,Does Allah authorize or teach magic for use against others?These questions deserve thorough scriptural and theological evaluation.2. The Nature and Effects of SorceryWitchcraft is commonly believed to bring harm to its victims, including strife, infertility, disease, mental distress, and even death. Many believe that through sorcery, malevolent individuals may send animals such as bats, birds, or flies to attack their enemies spiritually. In traditional African belief systems, this is not merely folklore but a daily spiritual reality.The Bible acknowledges the existence of such powers. For instance, in Matthew 12:43–45, Jesus refers to evil spirits that leave a person and return later with more wicked spirits, emphasizing the influence of demonic forces in human affairs. However, Jesus also underscores that these spirits are ultimately subordinate to God’s sovereignty.3. Does the Quran Teach Magic?A particularly striking verse in the Quran isSurah Al-Baqarah (2:102), which reads:“They followed what the devils used to recite during the reign of Solomon. Solomon did not disbelieve, but the devils disbelieved; they taught people magic and that which was revealed to the two angels, Harut and Marut, in Babylon. Yet these two would not teach anyone without first warning, ‘We are only a test, so do not disbelieve.’ But people learned from them what could cause separation between a man and his wife, though they could not harm anyone except by Allah’s permission...”(Quran 2:102)This verse presents several profound theological challenges:Magic (sihr)was allegedly taught bydevilsand also bytwo angelsnamed Harut and Marut.Allahpermittedthe existence and operation of this magic, though framed as a “test.”The magic involved had the power toseparate husbands and wives, a highly personal and destructive effect.The Quran claims that this magic could not operate unlessAllah permitted it, implying divine sanction.Such passages raise the question:If Allah permits magic and allows angels to teach it, even as a test, does that not make Him complicit in the spread of evil?4. Islamic Occultism and Traditional Healing PracticesThroughout the Muslim world—especially in East Africa and the Middle East—there exist Islamic traditional healers, often known aswaganga wa kienyejiorIslamic spiritual doctors, who claim to heal or curse using verses from the Quran. These healers often invokejinn (spirits)and use specificQuranic verses, amulets, and charms (known astaweez) in their practices.This presents a paradox: the Quran is considered the holy word of Allah, yet it is used in contexts reminiscent of occultism. What is the theological relationship between Allah, the Quran, and these practices of magic or spirit invocation?5. Biblical Teaching on Witchcraft: A Contrasting EthicThe Bible provides unambiguous commandments concerning witchcraft. Unlike the Quranic account, the biblical position is zero-tolerance:Leviticus 19:26:\"Do not practice divination or seek omens.\"Leviticus 20:27:\"A man or woman who is a medium or spiritist among you must be put to death.\"Deuteronomy 18:10–14:“Let no one be found among you who...practices divination or sorcery, interprets omens, engages in witchcraft, or casts spells...Anyone who does these things is detestable to the Lord.”The God of Israel (Yahweh) condemns sorcery not only as dangerous but also as an abomination. No angel in the Bible is portrayed as a teacher of sorcery. In fact, angelic beings serve only the will of God and are depicted as holy messengers who oppose demonic influences.6. Theological ImplicationsIf Allah permits the teaching of harmful magic—even as a \"test\"—then His moral character comes into question. A God who enables or sanctions dark arts for any reason becomes fundamentally incompatible with the God revealed in the Bible, who is holy, righteous, and cannot be tempted by evil (James 1:13).Furthermore, if Quranic verses can be employed for magical purposes—as in exorcisms, curses, and healing rituals involving jinn—this indicates that the sacred text itself contains latent occult power. This stands in stark contrast to the Bible, which attributes all miraculous or spiritual power to God alone, mediated by the Holy Spirit, never by human manipulation or rituals.7. Conclusion: A Biblical Call to DiscernmentThis investigation suggests that there are elements within Islamic texts and practices that appear to endorse or facilitate sorcery. While some Muslim scholars argue that such practices are distortions of true Islam, the Quranic evidence, particularly from Surah 2:102, remains problematic.Christians are called to reject all forms of sorcery and to rely solely on the power of God through Jesus Christ. The Holy Spirit—not mystical rituals, charms, or angels teaching magic—is the true source of spiritual power in the life of a believer. As the Apostle Paul declares:“For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers... Wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God...”(Ephesians 6:12–13)ReferencesThe Quran, Surah Al-Baqarah 2:102The Holy Bible, New International Version (NIV)Mambo ya Walawi (Leviticus) 19:26; 20:27Kumbukumbu la Torati (Deuteronomy) 18:10–14Matthew 12:43–45James 1:13Ephesians 6:12–13",

It critically explores how methods such as migration, asylum, education, and employment are utilized as tools for ideological expansionism. While acknowledging the diversity within Islamic communities, this article focuses on certain radical agendas aimed at transforming host nations into Islamic states governed by Sharia law. The study further evaluates the implications of religious-political hybridization for national sovereignty, religious freedom, and cultural preservation in non-Muslim majority societies.IntroductionThroughout history, religious ideologies have played pivotal roles in shaping political, cultural, and social landscapes. Islam, one of the major world religions, has witnessed both peaceful propagation and violent expansion. This article does not generalize all Muslims but focuses on radical elements that are alleged to employ subtle yet strategic methods to infiltrate, dominate, and transform non-Muslim societies into Islamic caliphates. Such radical ideology views the entire world as a potential Islamic state governed by Sharia law, and pursues this goal through both peaceful and violent means.1. Methods of Infiltration and Expansion1.1 Migration as a Tool of InfluenceMigration has long been a natural phenomenon in human history, often driven by economic, political, or environmental factors. However, certain Islamic ideological movements view migration (Hijrah) not only as a necessity but as a sacred duty and a strategic tool for expanding the Ummah (Islamic community). Through mass migration, Muslims settle in non-Muslim territories under the guise of seeking opportunity or refuge, but with an underlying agenda to Islamize their new environment over time.1.2 Refugee Asylum and Humanitarian ExploitationThe global refugee crisis has presented opportunities for Islamic radicals to enter foreign countries, particularly in the West and Africa, under humanitarian grounds. Host nations—motivated by compassion and international law—welcome these refugees and provide them with access to housing, healthcare, education, and civil liberties. Ironically, many of the rights offered are absent or severely restricted in their countries of origin, where strict Sharia law is enforced.1.3 Education and EmploymentMuslim students and workers often enter host nations through scholarships or work permits. While many genuinely seek better opportunities, radical ideologues may exploit this access to establish ideological strongholds within universities, workplaces, and civic institutions. As their numbers increase, they often form religious associations and pressure institutions to accommodate Islamic practices, leading to cultural shifts and gradual Islamization of public spaces.2. Early Stages of ConcealmentWhen Muslim populations are small, their presence is often characterized by peaceful coexistence. During this phase, Islamic leaders emphasize messages of tolerance, peace, and mutual respect, carefully avoiding public criticism of other religions or cultures. Religious gatherings are conducted discreetly, and political activism is minimal. However, beneath this peaceful appearance, efforts are often underway to increase Muslim populations through high birth rates and strategic marriages, thereby gradually shifting demographic balances.3. The Turning Point: From Minority to Political ForceWhen Muslims reach a significant proportion of the population—often around 50%—a noticeable transformation occurs. The community begins to demand political representation, Islamic legal courts (e.g.,Kadhicourts), and increased funding for Muslim institutions. Political parties and advocacy groups are formed to push Islamic interests. Religious structures such as mosques, madrassas, and Islamic centers multiply rapidly across the country.In some countries, radical Muslim groups begin to mobilize through protests, strikes, and civil disobedience campaigns, often citing religious discrimination. In extreme cases, churches are burned, pastors are attacked with acid, and there are increased reports of religiously motivated violence. This marks a significant shift from passive integration to aggressive demands and societal restructuring.4. Full-Scale Islamization and AuthoritarianismIn advanced stages, when Muslim populations exceed native or Christian communities, radical factions may initiate more aggressive actions:Religious Suppression: Prohibiting church construction and outlawing public Christian worship.Cultural Erasure: Banning indigenous traditions, renaming institutions, and converting churches into mosques.Legal Transformation: Imposing Sharia law, which often includes harsh penalties, child marriage, gender inequality, and restrictions on freedom of expression.Terror Tactics: Suicide bombings, assassinations, and destruction of government buildings become tactics to instill fear and coerce submission.Intimidation and Coercion: Individuals are threatened to convert to Islam or face death, mimicking historic jihadist campaigns.At this stage, constitutional law is replaced by Islamic law. Non-Muslims are reduced to second-class citizens (dhimmis), their freedoms revoked, and their cultural identities systematically dismantled. Native populations become refugees within their own homelands.5. Case Studies: Nations Under ThreatSeveral countries have either succumbed to or are currently facing the impact of such infiltration tactics:Tanzania & Kenya: Radical Islamist groups have targeted Christian communities with acts of violence and church burnings.Nigeria: The Boko Haram insurgency aims to establish an Islamic state, killing thousands of Christians.Egypt: The Coptic Christian population faces persistent persecution.France & the UK: Radicalization among migrant populations has led to terrorism, community segregation, and challenges to secular values.The Netherlands & Germany: Growing Islamic populations have led to rising demands for parallel legal systems.Conclusion and RecommendationsThis analysis does not seek to promote religious hatred or generalize all Muslims as extremists. Rather, it highlights the tactics used by certain radical factions that exploit religious freedom, humanitarian compassion, and liberal democracy to undermine non-Muslim societies. These strategies represent a form of stealth conquest—not by armies, but by ideology and demographics.Recommendations:Increased Vigilance: Governments should monitor radical religious groups operating under the guise of cultural or religious institutions.Civic Education: Citizens must be educated about ideological infiltration and the importance of preserving democratic and pluralistic values.Balanced Immigration Policy: Nations should reform immigration laws to prevent the influx of individuals from radicalized zones without thorough vetting.Interfaith Dialogue: Promote genuine interfaith dialogue that fosters transparency, equality, and mutual respect rather than submission to any ideology.Call to ActionIt is time for host nations to awaken to this growing ideological threat. Hospitality must never become a gateway for domination. The values of freedom, human dignity, and religious plurality must be defended against all forms of totalitarian encroachment, whether political or religious. Societies must act decisively to protect their heritage and uphold the principles of justice, peace, and true coexistence.Reflect. Be Alert. Take Action.",

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis concluding chapter synthesizes the theological, logical, and historical evidence presented in this investigation into the Islamic claim that the Injeel (Gospel) has been corrupted. Drawing on Quranic affirmations, manuscript traditions, theological doctrines of divine preservation, and rational-critical analysis, this final section evaluates the plausibility of textual corruption and reaffirms the integrity of the Injeel within the framework of Abrahamic faiths and historical-critical scholarship.1. IntroductionThroughout this seven-part investigation, we have sought to examine, with both academic rigor and theological sensitivity, the oft-repeated Islamic assertion that the Injeel has been corrupted. This question is not only theological in nature but also bears immense implications for interfaith dialogue, epistemology, and the historicity of sacred texts.To assess this claim, we have approached it from multiple dimensions: Quranic testimony, the internal witness of the Injeel and other Scriptures, logical coherence, and the manuscript history of the New Testament.2. Quranic Affirmation of the Injeel’s IntegrityThe Qur’an, far from suggesting corruption of the Injeel, emphatically affirms its divine origin and continued authority:Surah Al-Ma’idah 5:46– “And We sent, following in their footsteps, Jesus, the son of Mary, confirming that which came before him in the Torah; and We gave him the Injeel, in which was guidance and light…”Surah Al-Ma’idah 5:47– “So let the People of the Gospel judge by what Allah has revealed therein. And whoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed – then it is those who are the defiantly disobedient.”Surah Al-Baqarah 2:136andSurah Al-Imran 3:84command Muslims not to distinguish between revelations, acknowledging the Torah, Psalms, Injeel, and the Qur’an as equally inspired by God.Notably, there isno Quranic verse that explicitly declaresthe corruption (تحريف) of the Injeel as a whole. While there are references to certain individuals misinterpreting or concealing scriptures (e.g., Surah 2:79), these do not amount to doctrinal claims of total textual corruption.3. Theological Analysis: Can God's Word Be Corrupted?All three Abrahamic faiths agree on a fundamental attribute of God: Hissovereignty and omnipotence. From this flows the theological axiom thatGod’s Word cannot be thwarted or nullified by human interference.Psalm 119:89– “Forever, O LORD, your word is firmly fixed in the heavens.”Isaiah 40:8– “The grass withers, the flower fades, but the word of our God will stand forever.”Matthew 24:35– “Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.”Qur’an 6:115– “And the word of your Lord has been fulfilled in truth and in justice. None can change His words.”Therefore, from both Christian and Islamic theology,it is inconsistent to assert that mere mortals could corrupt the very revelation God has willed to preserve.4. Logical Reasoning: Interrogating the ClaimLet us now apply the principle of logical inquiry to the claim of corruption. Any such claim must answer the following five critical questions:4.1Who corrupted the Injeel?There is no historical or textual evidence pointing to a person, group, or empire capable of coordinating a global revision of Scripture. Christianity by the 2nd century had already spread across Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. No ecclesiastical body wielded such totalitarian control.4.2Why was the Injeel corrupted?There is no coherent or compelling motive proposed by Islamic traditions. What gain would early Christians have achieved by fabricating a Messiah who died and rose from the dead—only to be persecuted and martyred for such a message?4.3When was it corrupted?Was it before or after Prophet Muhammad?Before Muhammad?– Then why does the Qur’an affirm the Injeel in its existing form? Why does it instruct Christians to judge by it?After Muhammad?– Then why does the Qur’an not warn of this future corruption? Why is there no abrogation of the verses that promote belief in the Injeel?4.4Which parts were corrupted?If onlypartsof the Injeel were allegedly corrupted, then:Which verses exactly?Who made that determination?Where is the uncorrupted version?Muslim scholars historically have not presented a reliable, objective method to discern genuine from spurious verses—leaving the claim largely unsubstantiated.4.5Where is the original Injeel?According to textual scholars, the Gospels we possess today—particularly in codices such asCodex Vaticanus,Codex Sinaiticus, andCodex Alexandrinus—reflect what was written in the 1st century. There is no manuscript trail, archaeological evidence, or historical record suggesting an alternative \"original Injeel.\"5. Historical Analysis: The Transmission of the InjeelAs explored in Part 6, the Injeel was written by eyewitnesses and their close companions between ~50–95 AD. The process of transmission involved:Geographical dispersion: From Jerusalem to Antioch, Alexandria, Corinth, Rome, and beyond.Extensive copying and citation: By the 4th century, thousands of manuscript copies, in Greek and various translations (Latin, Coptic, Syriac), were in circulation.Church Fathers’ Quotations: Early theologians like Irenaeus, Tertullian, and Origen quoted the Injeel extensively—providing secondary verification of its content.Given this diffusion and attestation, it would be historically and logisticallyimpossiblefor anyone—church or empire—to collect, alter, and re-distribute all these copies without historical trace or protest.6. Martyrdom and TestimonyThe suggestion that the disciples fabricated the Gospel narratives collapses under scrutiny. The apostles:Claimed to witness Jesus’ life, death, and bodily resurrection.Were imprisoned, tortured, and executed—yet never recanted.Did not gain wealth or political power but suffered rejection, exile, and martyrdom.People may die for what theybelieveis true. Butno one dies for what they know to be a lie.7. Final ConclusionAfter examining the theological testimony, logical framework, historical manuscript evidence, and the human cost paid by the original followers of Jesus, we arrive at a conclusive assessment:There is no credible basis—textual, historical, theological, or logical—for asserting that the Injeel has been corrupted.This claim remains unsupported by:Quranic revelationHistorical documentationTextual criticism or manuscript evidenceRational analysisInstead, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the preservation of the Injeel as the authentic record of Jesus’ message. To assert corruption is to deny the ability—and promise—of God to protect His Word.8. Implications for Interfaith DialogueThis conclusion holds profound significance for both Muslims and Christians. If we affirm that:The Injeel has not been corrupted,The Qur’an affirms the Injeel,The Gospels accurately preserve Jesus’ message,Then the path is open for mutual dialogue rooted inhistorical honesty,textual integrity, andtheological consistency. Rather than division, such inquiries can lead to deeper understanding and respect between the two faiths.Recommended ReadingsBruce Metzger,The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and RestorationF.F.

An Academic and Theological InvestigationPart 3 of 7 – What Do the Other Holy Books Say About God’s Word?By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThe question of the textual integrity of theInjeel(Gospel) has long been debated between Muslim and Christian theologians. While some Islamic perspectives hold that the Injeel has been tampered with or altered over time, a closer examination of both the Qur’anic and Biblical records reveals a far more complex theological narrative. In this part of our academic investigation, we explore the internal testimony of the Holy Scriptures—namely, the Injeel (New Testament), the Tawrat (Torah), the Zabur (Psalms), and the words of the Prophets such as Isaiah—to ascertain what they themselves say concerning the nature, preservation, and authority of the Word of God.I. The Divine Inspiration and Authority of ScriptureA foundational theological claim within the Christian tradition is that all Scripture istheopneustos—“God-breathed.” The apostle Paul, writing to Timothy, makes this unequivocally clear:2 Timothy 3:16-17 (NIV):“All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.”The Greek termθεόπνευστος (theopneustos)denotes divine origin and affirms the ontological relationship between God and His written revelation. Likewise, Peter underscores the spiritual mechanics behind prophecy:2 Peter 1:20-21 (NIV):“Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet’s own interpretation of things. For prophecy never had its origin in human will, but prophets, though human, spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.”This emphasis on divine origination and spiritual guidance implies that the words of Scripture are not merely historical or literary artifacts, but the living and authoritative revelation of God.II. The Endurance and Fulfillment of God’s WordThe Injeel, according to Jesus Himself, affirms not only the authenticity but also the enduring permanence of the divine message transmitted through earlier revelations. Jesus, in the Sermon on the Mount, made the following statement:Matthew 5:17-18 (NIV):“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.”Here, “Law and Prophets” refer explicitly to theTawratand the canonical prophetic writings—documents which also include theZabur. Jesus confirms both their continuity and divine preservation.Moreover, inMatthew 24:35, Jesus declared:“Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.”This is a significant theological claim. It implies the immutability and permanence of Jesus’ teachings. If the words of Jesus (who is referred to in both Christian and Islamic traditions as theWord of God—see John 1:1, Revelation 19:13; Surah 3:45 and Surah 4:171) are eternal, then the corruption of such words is not only improbable but theologically untenable.III. God’s Protection Over His WordThe final book of the New Testament—the Revelation of John—provides a solemn warning concerning the manipulation of God’s Word:Revelation 22:18-19 (NIV):“I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this scroll: If anyone adds anything to them, God will add to that person the plagues described in this scroll. And if anyone takes words away from this scroll of prophecy, God will take away from that person any share in the tree of life and in the Holy City...”This warning reflects a divine protection mechanism over Scripture, reinforcing the notion that the preservation of God’s Word is not left to human discretion alone, but is under divine oversight.IV. The Eternal Nature of God’s Word in the Zabur and Prophetic BooksThe Psalms (Zabur), traditionally attributed to Prophet Dawud (David), offer some of the clearest declarations about the eternal and unchanging nature of God's Word:Psalm 119:89 (NIV):“Your word, LORD, is eternal; it stands firm in the heavens.”Psalm 119:152 (NIV):“Long ago I learned from your statutes that you established them to last forever.”Psalm 119:160 (NIV):“All your words are true; all your righteous laws are eternal.”Similarly, the prophet Isaiah confirms:Isaiah 40:8 (NIV):“The grass withers and the flowers fall, but the word of our God endures forever.”Isaiah 59:21 (NIV):“My Spirit, who is on you, will not depart from you, and my words that I have put in your mouth will always be on your lips...from this time on and forever.”These affirmations stand as theological pillars regarding the immutability and divine preservation of revelation.V. The Theological Dilemma of Alleged CorruptionGiven the above scriptural testimony, we are faced with a critical theological dilemma: Can the Word of God truly be corrupted when these very Scriptures repeatedly affirm its divine origin, its preservation, and its enduring nature?If the Injeel, Tawrat, and Zabur arekalimatullah—the Word of God—then to claim they are corrupted poses a challenge to both God's sovereignty and His promise to protect His Word. The Qur'an itself echoes these affirmations in places like:Surah 3:3:“He has revealed the Book to you with truth, confirming what was before it, and He revealed the Torah and the Gospel.”Surah 5:46-47:“And We sent, following in their footsteps, Jesus, the son of Mary, confirming that which came before him in the Torah; and We gave him the Gospel...”Surah 6:34:“There is none that can change the words of Allah...”Thus, for the Muslim reader, any claim of the corruption of the Injeel must be reconciled with these Qur’anic affirmations. If Allah revealed the Gospel and declared His words unchangeable, then the claim that His Word has been altered introduces a contradiction.ConclusionThe internal testimony of the Holy Books—across the Tawrat, Zabur, and Injeel—provides a unified voice: God's Word is inspired, divinely protected, and eternally enduring. The evidence presented reveals that the claim of corruption cannot be sustained without undermining the very Scriptures and divine attributes affirmed in both the Bible and the Qur'an.To suggest that God failed to protect His Word is to suggest that human agency is more powerful than divine sovereignty—an idea antithetical to both Islamic and Christian theologies.Coming Next:Part 4 – A Theological Investigation: What Does the Qur’an Say about the Bible’s Integrity?Dr. Maxwell ShimbaPresident, Shimba Theological InstituteBiblical Theologian | Interfaith Apologist | Scholar of Comparative Religion",

AN INVESTIGATIONPart 1 of 7 – IntroductionBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba | Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionAs-salāmu ʿalaykumto my respected Muslim brothers and sisters, Christian readers, and all seekers of truth. This academic series endeavors to carefully and critically examine a significant theological claim prevalent in Islamic tradition—that theInjeel(Arabic: الإنجيل), commonly understood as the Gospel or New Testament, has been corrupted (taḥrīf, تحريف). This claim, if true, carries profound implications not only for Christian theology but also for interfaith understanding between Muslims and Christians. If false, however, then it compels a reevaluation of commonly held assumptions and doctrines about the scriptures prior to the Qur'an.We therefore invite readers of all backgrounds and beliefs to approach this study with an open mind, intellectual curiosity, and a shared commitment to truth and historical integrity.What Is the Injeel?The termInjeeloriginates from the Arabicالإنجيل, which is etymologically derived from the Greek wordeuangelion(εὐαγγέλιον), meaning “good news” or “glad tidings.” This term was already in use by Arab Christians in the pre-Islamic era, referring to the message of Jesus the Messiah (ʿĪsā al-Masīḥ, عيسى المسيح) as preserved in the canonical New Testament writings.The Injeel, in Christian theological context, is not a single book revealed to Jesus word-for-word (as often assumed in Islamic doctrine), but rather the eyewitness testimonies of Jesus’ life, teachings, crucifixion, and resurrection as recorded by His disciples and earliest followers under divine inspiration. These include the four canonical Gospels—Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John—as well as the writings of the apostles that form the foundation of the New Covenant inaugurated by Christ.The Islamic Mandate to Believe in Previous ScripturesThe Qur’an instructs its followers to believe in the previous revelations: theTawrat(Torah), theZabur(Psalms), and theInjeel(Gospel), among others. Numerous verses emphasize the divine origin of these scriptures. For example, Surah Al-Ma’idah (5:46) says:\"And We sent, following in their footsteps, Jesus, the son of Mary, confirming that which came before him in the Torah; and We gave him the Gospel, in which was guidance and light...\"(Qur’an 5:46, Sahih International)Surah Al-Imran (3:3) similarly affirms:\"He has sent down upon you the Book in truth, confirming what was before it. And He revealed the Torah and the Gospel.\"(Qur’an 3:3)These verses assert not only that God revealed the Gospel, but that it contained “guidance and light”—a clear endorsement of its divine authority.Yet, despite these affirmations, many Muslims refrain from reading or consulting the New Testament, on the grounds that it has allegedly been altered or corrupted. This belief stems from the doctrine oftaḥrīf, which holds that previous scriptures were either misinterpreted, misrepresented, or deliberately changed over time by human hands.The Doctrine ofTaḥrīf(تحريف)The Islamic concept oftaḥrīfcan be classified into different interpretations by classical Muslim scholars:Taḥrīf al-lafẓī– corruption of the actual text.Taḥrīf al-maʿnawī– distortion of the meaning or interpretation.Taḥrīf al-nasḫ– abrogation of earlier scriptures by subsequent revelations.Over time, many Islamic scholars argued that the Jews and Christians altered the original messages of God either by editing the texts themselves (textual corruption) or by distorting their meanings (interpretive corruption). Consequently, it is claimed that God sent the Qur’an as the final, preserved, and incorruptible revelation to correct these distortions.However, this doctrinal development raises a series of important theological, historical, and logical questions, which form the basis of this investigation. If God truly revealed the Torah, the Psalms, and the Gospel, and commanded believers to follow them, would He then allow His Word to be lost or irretrievably corrupted before the final revelation? And if so, does this not undermine the reliability of any divine scripture, including the Qur’an?Purpose and Scope of This StudyIn this seven-part academic series, we will undertake a thorough investigation into the question:Is the Injeel corrupted?This inquiry will not be polemical, but scholarly and respectful, relying on classical sources, scriptural analysis, historical evidence, and rational inquiry. The goal is not to win arguments, but to seek truth in the light of divine revelation, history, and reason.The study will be divided into the following parts:Introduction– Defining terms and framing the issue.(You are here.)What Does the Qur’an Say About the Injeel?What Did the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and Early Muslims Say About the Injeel?What Is the Historical Evidence for or Against Corruption?What Do Christian and Jewish Sources Say About Their Scriptures?Logical and Theological Analysis of the Doctrine ofTaḥrīfConclusion: Is the Injeel Corrupted? A Balanced AssessmentThroughout this journey, we will also compare scriptural teachings from the Qur’an, the Bible, and other historical documents. The purpose is to clarify misunderstandings, correct misrepresentations, and build bridges of understanding across faiths.A Call to Honest InquiryFinally, I urge every reader—Muslim, Christian, or otherwise—to approach this study not with defensiveness, but with humility and courage. If the Injeel is indeed the Word of God, preserved and attested to by history and by the very Qur’an that affirms it, then it deserves to be read, studied, and honored. And if questions remain, let us confront them with integrity and mutual respect.Let the words of the Qur’an guide our attitude as we investigate:\"Say, 'Bring your proof if you are truthful.'\" (Qur’an 2:111)Let us therefore bring our proofs, examine them, and seek the truth together.Coming Next: What Does the Qur’an Say About the Injeel?Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

    "full_content": "By Max Shimba Ministries OrgAbstractThis paper explores the theological implications of Qur’an 6:7, which presents a hypothetical situation wherein God sends down a physical book on parchment to the Prophet Muhammad. Despite such tangible evidence, the Qur’an states that disbelievers would still accuse the revelation of being \"clear sorcery.\" This passage raises critical questions about the origin, function, and reception of thewrittenQur’an (the paper Qur’an) and the possibility that its physical form may, in some interpretations, be associated with mystical or magical connotations. We reflect on the implications of this verse from both Islamic and biblical perspectives and question whether the paper Qur’an, as used and perceived today, aligns with divine intention—or has become a medium of misunderstanding and superstition.1. IntroductionThe Qur’an, revered by Muslims as the literal word of God revealed to Prophet Muhammad, is believed to have been delivered orally over a period of 23 years. However, after the Prophet’s death, the oral recitations were compiled into a written form—what we now call theMus-haf, or the paper Qur’an.In Surah Al-An‘am 6:7, the Qur’an makes a provocative statement:\"And even if We had sent down to you (O Muhammad) a book written on parchment, and they touched it with their hands, the disbelievers would have said, 'This is nothing but obvious sorcery.'\"— Qur’an 6:7This verse invites an inquiry:Where did the modern paper Qur’an originate from, and why does the Qur’an anticipate that its physical form might be called sorcery?2. Translation of the Original Swahili StatementSwahili Original:QURAN YA KARATASI IMETOKA WAPI?KUMBE QURAN YA KARATASI NI UCHAWI.وَلَوْ نَزَّلْنَا عَلَيْكَ كِتَابًا فِي قِرْطَاسٍ فَلَمَسُوهُ بِأَيْدِيهِمْ لَقَالَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا إِنْ هَـٰذَا إِلَّا سِحْرٌ مُّبِينٌ[Surah Al-An‘am: 7]Na lau tungeli kuteremshia kitabu cha karatasi, wakakigusa kwa mikono yao, wangeli sema walio kufuru: Haya si chochote ila ni uchawi dhaahiri.Hii Quran ya kitabu chenye karatasi imetoka wapi?Hakika Quran ya karatasi ni uchawi.English Translation:Where did the paper Qur’an come from?So then, the Qur’an in paper form is sorcery.“And had We sent down to you (O Muhammad) a book written on parchment, and they touched it with their hands, those who disbelieved would have said, ‘This is nothing but clear sorcery.’”— [Surah Al-An‘am 6:7]Where did this paper version of the Qur’an originate?Indeed, the Qur’an in paper form is sorcery.3. Textual and Theological AnalysisThe verse in question anticipates human skepticism and suggests that even the clearest, tangible form of divine revelation would still be rejected by unbelievers. This raises a theological paradox:If God foresaw that a written, touchable scripture would be dismissed as sorcery, why did Islam later adopt and canonize such a physical format?The Arabic phrasekitāban fī qirṭās(a book on parchment) implies avisible, physical document, as opposed to the originaloral revelation.The termsiḥr mubīn(clear magic) reflects the reaction of hardened hearts, not the nature of the message—but the association between scripture and sorcery remains troubling in interpretation.4. Historical Shift: From Oral Revelation to Written TextInitially, the Qur’an was transmitted orally through memorization (ḥifẓ). It was only compiled into a written manuscript during the caliphate of Abu Bakr and standardized by Caliph Uthman. This raises an important question:Is the written Qur’an an inspired format, or a human convenience prone to misinterpretation?Furthermore, the use of the paper Qur’an in talismans, amulets, and ritual healing in various cultures reinforces the original fear:has the Qur’an, in its physical form, been transformed into an object of superstition or magical belief—exactly as the Qur’an warned?5. Comparative Reflection: Scripture and SuperstitionIn the Bible, God’s Word was given bothorally(e.g., prophets) andin written form(e.g., tablets, scrolls), but it always pointed totransformation of the heart, not magical outcomes. Jesus condemned those who sought signs and wonders (Matthew 12:39) instead of repentance.In contrast,Islamic reverence for the physical Qur’anhas, in some settings, overshadowed the call to spiritual obedience. The physical book is sometimes treated as a sacred object, even when not read or understood. This can lead tobibliolatry(worship of the book) rather thantrue devotion to God.6. ConclusionQur’an 6:7 provides a powerful warning:the medium of revelation does not guarantee belief.Tangibility is not the answer to disbelief. Ironically, the modern printed Qur’an, treated by some with superstitious reverence or used in magical practices, may fulfill the very criticism leveled by the disbelievers in the verse.Thus, it is right to ask: where did the paper Qur’an come from—and what has it become?If it leads to faith and truth, it is a vessel of God's word.If it becomes a tool of fear, talismanic ritual, or blind reverence,then it has become, as the verse says, “nothing but manifest sorcery.”Shalom,Max Shimba Ministries Org",

    "full_content": "Title: Questioning the Authenticity of the Quran and the Prophethood of Muhammad: An Academic Inquiry into the Role of Jibril and His Alleged EnemyBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThe foundational claim of Islam is that the Quran is the verbatim word of Allah, revealed to the Prophet Muhammad via the angel Jibril (Gabriel). However, emerging critical studies—textual, theological, and historical—raise questions regarding the authenticity and reliability of such claims. This article examines Quran 2:97 in light of the concept of the “enemy of Jibril” and investigates the possibility that deceptive spiritual entities may have infiltrated Muhammad’s prophetic experiences. This analysis engages Quranic verses, Hadith literature, and classical Islamic sources while integrating Christian theological frameworks to assess the plausibility of divine versus deceptive revelation.1. IntroductionThe Quran makes bold claims about its divine origin, stating repeatedly that it is the “Word of Allah” (Quran 6:19, 10:37, 45:6). Muslims believe that Jibril (Gabriel) delivered the entire Quran to Muhammad over a 23-year period. However, an under-examined but critical verse in the Quran—Surah Al-Baqarah 2:97—mentions thatthere are individuals who are \"enemies of Jibril.\"The implications of this are far-reaching: Could Jibril have been impersonated? Could deceptive revelation have occurred? Did Muhammad himself differentiate between authentic and counterfeit spiritual visitations?2. Textual Analysis of Quran 2:97\"Say, whoever is an enemy to Gabriel—it is [none but] he who has brought it [i.e., the Qur'an] down upon your heart, [O Muhammad], by permission of Allah, confirming that which was before it...\"(Quran 2:97)The verse is often interpreted as a response to Jewish or other tribes who denied Jibril’s authority. However,the existence of an “enemy” of Jibril implies opposition to the transmission of divine revelation.It is theologically reasonable to ask:Could this enemy be spiritual in nature?Could a spiritual deceiver have masqueraded as Jibril?Classical exegetes like Al-Tabari and Ibn Kathir ignore this possibility, yet such neglect reveals a significant gap in critical exegesis.3. Was Muhammad Deceived by a Spirit Masquerading as Jibril?One of the most controversial accounts in early Islamic tradition is the episode of theSatanic Verses—reported inIbn Ishaq, Al-Tabari, and others, where Muhammad allegedly recited verses praising the pagan goddesses Al-Lat, Al-Uzza, and Manat. These verses were later abrogated and replaced, with the claim thatSatan \"interjected\" them(see Quran 22:52):\"Never did We send a messenger or a prophet before you but when he recited the message, Satan cast into his recitation...\"This verse not only confirms satanic interference in prophetic messages, but it also leaves open the door for amisidentification of spirits.If Satan can cast words into the mouth of a prophet, could he also impersonate the medium of transmission—Jibril?4. Was the Enemy of Jibril Wearing the \"Form\" of Jibril?The Hadith literature reveals that Jibril often came in various forms, including the form ofa man with black hair and white garments(Sahih Muslim, Book of Faith). This anthropomorphic presentation invites the possibility thatanother spiritual entity could mimic Jibril’s form.In 2 Corinthians 11:14, Paul warns:\"Even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.\"If Muhammad was unaware of this theological danger, the question arises:Was he equipped to discern the real Jibril from a deceptive imposter?5. The Identity of the Enemy of JibrilWho, then, is this “enemy of Jibril”? Islamic sources vaguely reference Jewish antagonists, but a spiritual reading suggestsa deeper force—Satan himself, or his demonic agents, opposing and potentiallyinterveningin divine communication. Theologically, this enemy could have:Introduced errors into Muhammad’s recitation.Masqueraded as Jibril in key revelations.Influenced controversial verses (e.g., violence, sexual rewards in Paradise, abrogation of earlier scriptures).6. Muhammad’s Silence on the Enemy of JibrilNotably, Muhammad never explicitly warned his followers aboutthe potential deception of spirits—a critical omission when compared to Biblical prophets who emphasized testing spirits (1 John 4:1). The absence of any criteria for validating angelic revelation further undermines the trustworthiness of Muhammad’s experience.7. Implications for the Authenticity of the QuranIf Muhammadcould not definitively distinguish between Jibril and a deceptive spirit, several troubling consequences arise:The Quran may contain verses not from God.Theological contradictions (e.g., Quran 4:157 vs. history of crucifixion) may stem from confusion.The legitimacy of Muhammad’s entire prophethood is under question.The claim that the Quran is perfectly preserved loses force ifanypart of it was delivered under deception.8. ConclusionThe figure of the “enemy of Jibril” in Quran 2:97, when read critically, opens a theological and epistemological crisis for Islam. If satanic forces could interfere, impersonate, or manipulate revelation—as affirmed by Quran 22:52 and the Satanic Verses tradition—then the door is wide open todoubt the authenticity of the Quran. Furthermore, Muhammad’s own inability to detect and expose the enemy of Jibril severely undermines his credibility as a prophet.Until Islamic scholarship addresses these critical concerns honestly, the Quran’s divine claim remains academically and spiritually questionable.Author: Dr. Maxwell ShimbaPresident and Senior Scholar, Shimba Theological InstituteSpecialist in Comparative Theology, Prophetic Criticism, and Qur’anic Analysis",

Rooted in Quran 2:97, this theory is often hidden or downplayed by Islamic clerics, especially in their teachings to Muslim youth. Through exegetical analysis, theological evaluation, and comparative textual study, this article seeks to explore whether the Quran itself supports or contradicts the idea that Jibril (Gabriel) was truly the messenger of divine revelation—or whether another spiritual force masquerading as Gabriel delivered the Quran.Introduction:The Quran is traditionally believed by Muslims to be the literal word of Allah, revealed to the Prophet Muhammad by the angel Jibril (Gabriel). However, certain Quranic verses, particularlyQuran 2:97, have raised questions regarding the true nature of this revelation and whether Islamic tradition has suppressed alternative readings or interpretations. This article addresses the controversial argument that thetrue enemy of divine truth posed as Jibril, deceiving Muhammad and giving rise to the Quran.Quran 2:97 – Literal Translation and Classical Interpretation:Quran 2:97 (Sahih International):“Say, 'Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel—it is [none but] he who has brought it [i.e., the Quran] down upon your heart, [O Muhammad], by permission of Allah, confirming that which was before it and as guidance and good tidings for the believers.’”This verse is a response to the Jewish tribes of Medina who, according to Islamic sources (e.g., Tafsir Ibn Kathir), rejected Gabriel because they believed he was a bringer of war, unlike Michael, who was associated with mercy.Key Observations:Gabriel is described as the conveyor of the Quran.The verse assumes someoneisan enemy of Gabriel.This opens up theological space: Can Gabriel be opposed? And could another spirit impersonate him?Theological Dilemma: Can an Angel of God Be Rejected or Misidentified?If Jibril is an angel of Allah and the bearer of divine truth, how can someone legitimately be his \"enemy\"? In biblical and Jewish thought, angels of God are holy, and hostility toward them is equivalent to hostility toward God (cf. Zechariah 3:1, where Satan accuses Joshua before the angel of the Lord).Could it be that Quran 2:97 subtly reveals thatthe spirit whom Muhammad encountered may not have been the true Gabriel? Could it be acounterfeit angel, akin to Paul’s warning in2 Corinthians 11:14:“And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.”Early Islamic Sources: Muhammad's Fear of Demonic PossessionIslamic historiography provides support for this line of questioning:Sahih Bukhari, Vol. 9, Book 87, Hadith 111:Muhammad initially feared he waspossessed by a jinn(evil spirit) after his first encounter with the angel in the cave of Hira.He contemplated suicide, thinking the presence was demonic—not angelic.Why would a true prophet fear divine revelation?Unless, perhaps, the spirit he encountered bore not the peace of God but the confusion of deception.The “Enemy of Gabriel” as a Masked Deceiver?In theological perspective, particularly from Christian and Jewish traditions, an enemy of Gabriel cannot be human only—it may be spiritual. If Gabriel is a divine messenger, then his \"enemy\" could beSatan, who opposes all of God's messengers.Thus, if Quran 2:97 mentionsan enemy of Gabriel, it may be aspiritual force in opposition to the divine Gabriel—and yet cunning enough to poseasGabriel to deceive.Could it be thatthis “enemy” took Gabriel’s form and brought the Quran, deceiving Muhammad, who was initially unsure of the encounter’s authenticity?This would explain:Why Muhammad doubted the experience.Why the Quran contradicts previous revelations (Torah and Gospel).Why the content of the Quran glorifies war, misogyny, and deception—traits alien to biblical revelation.Scholarly Silence and Islamic Clerical SuppressionIn modern Islamic education:Critical verses like 2:97 are not emphasized in their theological depth.Youth are toldwhat to believe, not encouraged toread and question.Commentaries (tafsir) often deflect attention from the spiritual implications of the text.This has led to anintellectual stagnationwhere alternate readings of verses like Quran 2:97 are actively suppressed. The fear is that deeper investigation might lead to the conclusion thatthe Quran is a spiritual counterfeit.Conclusion:Quran 2:97 may unintentionally reveal more than traditional Islamic scholars admit. The mention of an \"enemy to Gabriel\" is not just a throwaway phrase—it is the key to understanding a deeper spiritual battle over the source of the Quran. When coupled with Muhammad’s initial fear of possession, and Paul's warning about Satan masquerading as an angel of light, a compelling theological case arises:The enemy of Gabriel may have been the actual source of the Quran—deceiving Muhammad, claiming to be Gabriel, and thereby leading millions into theological darkness.This claim demands deeper scholarly and theological reflection, especially among Muslims who seek the truth. For seekers of light, this verse may be the very doorway to discovering the spiritual conflict behind Islam’s origin.References:The Quran, Surah Al-Baqarah 2:97Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 87:111Tafsir Ibn Kathir – Commentary on 2:972 Corinthians 11:14 (New Testament)Zechariah 3:1 (Old Testament)Samuel M.

    "full_content": "Title:Moral Integrity and Historical Narratives: A Critical Examination of Aisha bint Abi Bakr in Early IslamAuthor: Dr. Maxwell ShimbaInstitution: Max Shimba Ministries OrgCorrespondence:info@maxshimbaministries.orgAbstractThis article critically examines the moral character of Aisha bint Abi Bakr—one of the wives of Prophet Muhammad—based on early Islamic sources. Despite being revered in Islamic tradition as the “Mother of the Believers,” this study interrogates her portrayal in Hadith literature, especially focusing on her early marriage, controversial behaviors, and the “Incident of Ifk” (accusation of adultery). The piece argues that these narratives raise profound ethical and theological concerns when measured against contemporary moral standards. Finally, it contrasts Islamic teachings with the Christian understanding of moral integrity as exemplified in the life and teachings of Jesus Christ.1. IntroductionIn Islamic history and tradition, Aisha bint Abi Bakr holds an esteemed place as one of the Prophet Muhammad’s wives and a significant narrator of Hadith. Referred to as “Umm al-Mu’minin” (Mother of the Believers), her life and character continue to influence Islamic jurisprudence and gender roles. However, critical analyses of Islamic sources reveal troubling narratives that warrant scholarly scrutiny.2. Reverence in Islam: The Elevated Status of AishaMuslims revere Aisha not only as the Prophet’s wife but also as the daughter of Abu Bakr, the first Caliph. Hadiths fromSahih al-BukhariandSahih Muslimrecord the Prophet’s deep affection for Aisha. For instance:“Who is the most beloved person to you, O Messenger of Allah?” He said, “Aisha.” Then he asked, “And among the men?” He said, “Her father.” – (Bukhari)Islamic traditions also assert that Aisha was exonerated from accusations of adultery through divine revelation from the seventh heaven (Surah An-Nur 24:11–26), confirming her purity.3. The Marriage ControversyAisha’s marriage to Muhammad has sparked moral and academic debate. According toSahih Bukhari (Vol. 7, Book 62, Hadith 88)andSahih Muslim (Book 8, Hadith 3309–3311), Aisha was married to Muhammad at age six and the marriage consummated when she was nine.“The Prophet married me when I was six years old, and consummated the marriage when I was nine.” – Aisha (Bukhari)The psychological, social, and moral implications of this marriage have led to considerable debate. Critics argue that this relationship reflects a moral dissonance when viewed through a modern ethical lens, especially considering the age of the bride and the authority of the groom.4. Questionable Behaviors and Public AppearancesHadiths also depict scenes where Aisha, still a child, observed Abyssinian men dancing in the mosque courtyard while being shielded under the Prophet's garment.“I kept watching them until I was satisfied and turned away.” – (Bukhari Vol. 7, Book 62, Hadith 163)This narrative raises questions about Aisha’s psychological and social development. How could a child of nine, not yet having reached puberty, express interest in such entertainment? Some argue that this reflects early exposure to adult dynamics, potentially compromising childhood innocence.5. The Incident of Ifk (Adultery Accusation)A central controversy surrounding Aisha is the\"Ifk Incident\", narrated in early Islamic sources likeIbn HishamandIbn Ishaq, where Aisha was accused of committing adultery withSafwan ibn al-Mu'attal.The Prophet, distressed by the scandal, sent Aisha back to her parents. Although Surah An-Nur later declared her innocence, the initial public reaction in Medina—including suspicions from companions like Ali ibn Abi Talib—raises ethical concerns regarding the Prophet’s judgment and the broader communal suspicion.6. Jealousy and Insecurity in the Prophet's HouseholdHadith literature records Aisha expressing jealousy towards Khadijah, Muhammad’s first wife, despite Khadijah having died before Aisha joined the household:“Why do you keep remembering that old woman with red gums?” – Aisha (Bukhari Vol. 5, Book 58, Hadith 168)Such statements reflect emotional immaturity and possible insecurity, further complicating her image as a moral exemplar and religious authority.7. Critical ReflectionsGiven these documented incidents—from early marriage to jealousy, public dancing, and a major accusation of adultery—questions arise:Can Aisha be considered a moral authority and role model for Muslim women?Moreover, if the Prophet's household was marked by jealousy, rivalry, and scandal, can Muhammad be upheld as the model of family and spiritual leadership?8. A Christian Contrast: The Way, the Truth, and the LifeIn contrast, Christianity presents Jesus Christ as the ultimate moral exemplar. InJohn 14:6, Jesus states:“I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.”This declaration offers:A singular moral pathbased on love, purity, and righteousness.Eternal lifefound only in divine truth—not human traditions marred by questionable ethics.Christianity emphasizes spiritual rebirth, moral transformation, and a standard of holiness unattainable through legalism or flawed human examples.9. ConclusionWhile Islamic tradition venerates Aisha and Muhammad, critical historical and textual analysis reveals a more complex and morally troubling narrative. From the early marriage to scandals and household tensions, these accounts raise doubts about their moral credibility.Only Jesus Christ—untainted by sin, fully divine and fully human—offers a reliable and holy path to God.“Reflect. Question. Take Action. Come to Jesus.”ReferencesSahih Bukhari, various Hadith collections.Sahih Muslim, various Hadith numbers.Ibn Hisham,Sirat Rasul Allah.Ibn Ishaq,Life of Muhammad(translated by A. Guillaume).The Holy Bible, John 14:6 (New King James Version).The Holy Qur’an, Surah An-Nur 24:11–26.",

Qur'anic Perspective on Anal Intercourse1. Qur'an 2:222–223The Qur'an states:“They ask you concerning menstruation. Say: It is a harm, so keep away from women during menstruation... Your wives are a tilth for you, so go to your tilth when and how you will...”(Qur'an 2:222–223)While this passage appears metaphorical, various Islamic scholars and Hadiths have interpreted the phrase“go to your tilth as you will”as permitting various forms of sexual expression. However, the interpretation is contested.2. Classical Islamic InterpretationsAccording toAd-Durr al-Manthur(vol. 1, p. 474) andFath al-Bari(vol. 8, pp. 38–39), a narration by Naafi reports that Abdullah ibn Umar believed this verse referred to anal intercourse. This view has stirred debate within the Islamic world, with some scholars accepting it and others strictly condemning it as haram (forbidden).II. Christian (Biblical) PerspectiveThe Bible speaks clearly against unnatural sexual acts, not only between men and animals but also acts deviating from natural intercourse between husband and wife.1. Leviticus 20:13–16“If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination... If a man marries a woman and her mother, it is depravity... If a man has sexual relations with an animal, he must be put to death...”These scriptures reveal that unnatural sexual acts, including same-sex relations and bestiality, are consideredabominationsbefore God. Although not explicitly addressing anal sex within marriage, the broader biblical ethic upholds sexual purity and natural order as defined in Genesis (2:24).III. Medical and Psychological ImplicationsMedical researchers have raised several concerns about anal intercourse, particularly for women:1.Damage During ChildbirthWomen who regularly engage in anal sex may experience weakened anal sphincter muscles, resulting in incontinence during labor.2.Increased Risk of Colon CancerPersistent trauma and irritation of the rectal area can lead to chronic inflammation, increasing the risk of colon cancer.3.Loss of Sphincter ControlWith age and repeated exposure, women may lose control over bowel movements due to weakened sphincter muscles.4.Death of the Child During LaborDue to misaligned pressure and anatomy disruption, a child’s oxygen flow may be cut during birth as a result of a mother’s damaged pelvic muscles.These risks highlight why many women—especially those who report having experienced this practice in Islamic-majority settings—suffer long-term physical and psychological harm.IV. Ethical and Spiritual ConsiderationsThe Bible teaches that:“My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.”(Hosea 4:6)“You are in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God.”(Matthew 22:29)From a Christian worldview, sexual behavior is not merely physical but deeply spiritual. Acts against natural design violate the Creator’s intention and bring both physical and spiritual consequences. Thus, if a holy book permits practices that result in moral decay and physical damage, its divine origin must be questioned.V. Comparative Theological ReflectionScripturePermits Anal Intercourse?Spiritual VerdictQur’anInterpreted by some as YesEthically ambiguousBibleNo (Implicitly and morally)Explicitly condemnedGiven the contradictory positions, one must ask: Can a divine book contradict the natural, physical, and moral order established by the Creator? If so, can such a book genuinely be from the true and holy God?ConclusionAnal sex (Tigo) is both physically harmful and spiritually destructive. The Qur’an, through some interpretations, permits it, leading to widespread normalization among certain groups. The Bible, on the other hand, upholds the sanctity and naturalness of sexual intimacy within marriage, warning against deviations.Final AppealTo all who desire truth, health, and spiritual clarity: Seek Jesus, the Way, the Truth, and the Life.(John 14:6)RecommendationsFor Christians:Do not compromise spiritual convictions for the sake of physical intimacy.For Muslims:Reexamine your scriptures and consult the Bible as the final authority of divine morality.For all:Let us uphold both physical health and spiritual integrity in our relationships.Contact & MinistryMax Shimba Ministries OrgProclaiming the Truth in Love and Boldness[Visit us for more:www.maxshimbaministries.org]",

It poses essential questions about the violent nature of certain Islamic doctrines, the confusion within Islamic eschatology, and the identity of the Islamic Messiah—Imam al-Mahdi—as it relates to the figure of the Antichrist in the Bible. Through comparative religious analysis, the study seeks to uncover whether Islamic teachings align with the character of the God revealed in Scripture, and if Islam plays a role in the end-time events foretold in the Bible.1. Introduction: The Global Quest for TruthThroughout history, human societies have persistently asked fundamental questions:Where did the universe come from?Why does religion often involve suffering and hatred toward non-believers?Why is there more doctrinal confusion in Islam than in Christianity?Why does Allah permit the killing of non-believers?Why is Islam historically spread more through warfare than through love?These questions have led many scholars and thinkers to scrutinize the origins and character of Islam and its founder, Muhammad.2. The Origins of Muhammad and His LineageMuhammad came from the tribe ofBanu Hashim, meaning“sons of Hashim.”According to the Urban Dictionary, the nameHashimcan be interpreted as “destroyer.” [Source: UrbanDictionary.com]Thus, etymologically, Muhammad could be described as a “son of the destroyer.” Presently, many Muslims await the coming ofImam al-Mahdi, whom Islamic sources claim will be from the lineage of Muhammad, making him likewise a “descendant of the destroyer.”3. Islamic Eschatology and the Coming of Imam al-MahdiAccording toTirmidhiandAbu Dawud, Muhammad is reported to have said:“The world will not pass away until a man from among my family, whose name will be my name, rules over the Arabs.”(Tirmidhi, Sahih, Vol. 9, p.74; Abu Dawud, Sahih, Vol. 5, p.207)Further Islamic tradition describesImam al-Mahdi:“He will have a broad forehead and a prominent nose. He will fill the earth with justice as it had been filled with oppression and tyranny. He will rule forseven years.”(Abu Dawud, Sahih, Vol. 2, p.208; Fusul al-Muhimma, p.275)4. The Biblical Parallel: The Antichrist and the Seven-Year ReignThe Bible prophesies of a ruler to come, commonly identified as theAntichrist, who will sign aseven-year covenant of peace, deceiving even the Jewish people.“He will confirm a covenant with many for one ‘seven.’ In the middle of the ‘seven’ he will put an end to sacrifice and offering.”(Daniel 9:27)One \"week\" (Hebrew:shabua) = 7 days = 7 years (prophetic scale)Midpoint = 3½ yearsReign = 7 years of deceit, destruction, and global dominationThis description aligns with the Islamic belief thatImam al-Mahdi will rule for seven years—a significant eschatological parallel.5. Islam’s Role in the Last Days According to the BibleMuslims frequently declare:“Islam will dominate the world.”While this may occur temporarily, theBible clearly warnsthat this dominion will only last for seven years—after which divine judgment will fall.“Then I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was given to them. And I saw the souls ofthose who had been beheaded because of their testimony about Jesus and because of the word of God…”(Revelation 20:4)This verse prophetically describes thebeheading of Christians—a form of execution practiced and sanctioned in some Islamic traditions.6. Key Theological Questions RaisedThe following reflective questions arise when comparing Biblical truth to Islamic eschatology:Who on earth is most offended by the claim that Jesus is God?Which religion historically and currently practices beheading as punishment for religious dissent?What will Imam al-Mahdi, when he takes global leadership, do to those who profess Jesus as God?Jesus warned:“The time is coming when anyone who kills you will think they are offering a service to God. They will do such things because they have not known the Father or Me.”(John 16:2-3)7. Theological Implications and ConclusionThe Bible teaches that in the last days, adeceptive ruler will rise, ushering in a time of persecution and mass executions of believers in Christ. This Antichrist figure shares remarkable similarities with theIslamic Mahdias described in Hadith literature.While some denominations such asSeventh-Day Adventistshave traditionally associated the Antichrist with the Roman Papacy, the eschatological data within both Islamic and Christian textsstrongly point toward Islam's eschatological figure as the likely Antichrist.Thus, Christians must discern the times andstudy the true Word of God, so that they are not deceived by doctrines contrary to the Gospel of Christ.“You shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.”(John 8:32)BibliographyThe Holy Bible, Daniel 9, Revelation 20, John 16Hadith Sources:Sunan Abu DawudJami’ al-TirmidhiFusul al-MuhimmaUrbanDictionary.com definition of “Hashim”Scholarly commentaries on Islamic and Christian eschatology",

    "full_content": "Title: The Marital Transition of Muhammad After Khadijah: An Analytical and Theological InquiryBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaMax Shimba Ministries OrgAbstractThis article examines the marital life of Muhammad, specifically focusing on the sudden increase in his number of wives after the death of his first wife, Khadijah. By drawing from Islamic sources, particularlySahih Bukhari, and by analyzing historical and sociocultural dynamics of 7th-century Arabia, the article explores whether Muhammad's monogamous commitment to Khadijah stemmed from sincere affection, strategic necessity, or social constraint. The study also investigates what his post-Khadijah polygamy suggests about his personal inclinations and theological motivations.IntroductionThe marriage of Prophet Muhammad to Khadijah bint Khuwaylid stands as a significant point in the Prophet’s biography. It is often cited by Muslim scholars as an example of a faithful and noble marital relationship. However, an observable shift occurred after Khadijah’s death: Muhammad rapidly married multiple women. This article seeks to examine the possible motives behind that shift and to assess whether his early monogamy was due to genuine affection, social dependence, fear, or pragmatic survival.Key Questions for ConsiderationSeveral critical questions emerge from this marital transformation:Did Muhammad have a particular preference for older women?Was he initially against polygamous marriages?Did he fear Khadijah and thus refrain from taking other wives?Was his love for Khadijah genuine or conditional?Each of these inquiries opens a window into understanding Muhammad’s character, values, and strategic decisions in his formative years and prophetic mission.Historical Context: Poverty, Orphanhood, and SecurityMuhammad was an orphan who grew up under the care of various relatives. His early life was characterized by poverty and instability. At the age of 25, he married Khadijah, a wealthy merchant widow who was 15 years his senior. Importantly, it was Khadijah who proposed marriage, a fact that reverses traditional gender norms in Arab society of the time.This marriage offered Muhammad not only emotional companionship but also material security. It is plausible to argue that this union provided the first stable home he had ever known. In that light, his commitment to Khadijah may have stemmed from a deep sense of gratitude, economic dependency, and psychological comfort—factors that likely outweighed romantic or sexual interests.Hadith Evidence: The Desire for VirginsA telling hadith found inSahih Bukhari(Volume 3, Book 34, Number 310) sheds light on Muhammad's preferences:“The Prophet asked Jarir bin ‘Abdullah: ‘Have you got married?’ He replied, ‘Yes.’ The Prophet asked, ‘A virgin or a matron?’ He replied, ‘A matron.’ The Prophet said, ‘Why not a virgin so that you may play with her and she with you?’”This conversation suggests that Muhammad saw particular appeal in marrying virgins—indicative of a desire possibly unfulfilled during his marriage to Khadijah. It leads one to infer that abstaining from such desires during the earlier marriage may not have been due to disinterest but due to situational or emotional constraints.The Explosion of Polygamy Post-KhadijahAfter Khadijah’s death, Muhammad’s marriage pattern changed dramatically. Within a few years, he had married multiple women, many of whom were younger and from various tribes. This rapid shift may signify the lifting of a social or emotional constraint that was previously limiting him. The metaphor of \"a prison gate being broken\" is fitting: it implies that Khadijah’s presence possibly served as a moral, emotional, or strategic restraint on Muhammad’s polygamous desires.Additionally, these marriages had political, social, and religious functions: they were used to forge alliances, secure loyalty, and provide shelter to widows. However, the speed and volume of these marriages raise questions about personal motivations versus public duties.Conclusion: Was the Monogamy Tactical?It is reasonable to consider that Muhammad's monogamy during his marriage to Khadijah was not necessarily a lifelong conviction but perhaps a necessity rooted in his precarious social status and the power dynamic within that marriage. Once Khadijah—his primary source of security—was gone, Muhammad had the liberty and motivation to explore marital options that may have long appealed to him.This study does not claim to reduce Muhammad’s marriage to Khadijah to mere opportunism, but rather suggests a complex interplay of survival, gratitude, affection, and unfulfilled desires. The post-Khadijah polygamy, therefore, reveals a deeper aspect of his personality and provides scholars with fertile ground for examining the human side of the Prophet of Islam.ReferencesSahih Bukhari, Volume 3, Book 34, Hadith 310Guillaume, A.The Life of Muhammad: A Translation of Ibn Ishaq’s Sirat Rasul AllahWatt, W.

It evaluates the theological, moral, and metaphysical implications of this promise and draws comparative insights from biblical eschatology and demonological literature. The study further explores whether such a promise aligns with the broader framework of Abrahamic monotheism and suggests that these 'houris' and the 'inheritance from hell' reflect metaphors of demonic sensuality rather than divinely sanctioned gifts, proposing a provocative thesis: that these seventy beings represent the infernal rather than the celestial. The work concludes with implications for interfaith dialogue and eschatological anthropology.IntroductionIslamic eschatology, as derived from the Qur'an and Hadith, often emphasizes the sensual rewards awaiting the faithful in paradise. Among the most controversial narrations is the promise ofseventy-two virgins(houris) to male believers admitted to Jannah (Paradise). This motif has been especially highlighted in jihadist rhetoric and critiques of Islamic theology by non-Muslim scholars. A particularly revealing narration is found inSunan Ibn Majah 4337, which states:“There is no one whom Allah will admit to Paradise but Allah will marry him to seventy-two wives, two from houris and seventy from his inheritance from the people of Hell, all of whom will have desirable front passages and he will have a male member that never becomes flaccid.”—(Sunan Ibn Majah, Book 37, Hadith 238, English translation: Vol. 5, Book 37, Hadith 4337)This article evaluates the theological and moral implications of this narration and posits that these figures — referred to as 'inheritance from the people of Hell' — suggest an association with demonic entities rather than divine blessings.The Hadith Tradition and Its Eschatological PromisesHadith collections such asSahih al-Bukhari,Sahih Muslim,Sunan Abu Dawud, andSunan Ibn Majahrecord sayings attributed to Muhammad, forming the secondary source of Islamic jurisprudence and theology after the Qur'an. The notion ofhouris— beautiful, untouched, immortal women — is elaborated in Qur'anic passages such asSurah Al-Rahman 55:72andSurah Al-Waqi'ah 56:22-23. Yet, the addition of 'seventy from his inheritance from the people of Hell' raises unsettling theological and moral questions.What does it mean for a believer in Paradise to inherit individuals from Hell?Islamic theologians have struggled with this phrasing, as it seems incompatible with the nature of Paradise as a realm of purity and divine sanctity.Demonic Symbolism and Infernal InheritanceThe phrase'inheritance from the people of Hell'implicitly aligns these seventy entities with the infernal domain. In classical demonology, especially in Jewish and Christian traditions,demons were believed to inhabit Sheol (Hell) and were associated with sexual perversion, deception, and torment(cf.1 Enoch 15–16; Luke 8:30). The imagery of seventy beings, sexually available and sourced from Hell, suggests not a divine reward but aninfernal entrapment.Historically, the numberseventy-twohas mystical and demonic connotations. The medieval\"Lemegeton\" (The Lesser Key of Solomon), a grimoire of demonology, lists72 demons of the Ars Goetia, commanding legions of infernal spirits. Though predating Islamic tradition, this conceptual parallel is striking. It raises the speculative yet theologically pertinent question:Could Muhammad’s promise of seventy infernal companions inadvertently echo ancient Near Eastern demonology?Comparative Eschatology: The Bible vs. the HadithTheBiblical concept of the afterlifeoffers a stark contrast. InRevelation 21:4, Heaven is a realm where“there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain.”It lacks any description of carnal indulgences.Matthew 22:30explicitly states that“in the resurrection, people will neither marry nor be given in marriage, but will be like the angels in heaven.”This divergence reflects two fundamentally opposed theological anthropologies:The Islamic Hadith modelthat envisions Paradise as a place of corporeal and sensual gratification, even involving entities sourced from Hell.The Judeo-Christian modelthat conceives of the afterlife as a spiritual, incorruptible existence devoid of sexual desire or infernal influences.Moral and Theological ImplicationsThe idea of rewarding pious men with beings from Hell presents profound moral contradictions. If the inhabitants of Hell are condemned for their sins, how can they be elevated to reward the righteous? Furthermore, the text’s emphasis on perpetual male potency and sexual servitude objectifies these entities, reducing Paradise to a carnal fantasy rather than a realm of divine communion.From atheological anthropologyperspective, this reflects an anthropocentric, male-dominated eschatology inconsistent with monotheistic purity. The claim that such beings could inhabit Paradise undermines the very notion of Heaven as sanctified and untainted by sin.ConclusionThis analysis concludes that the promise recorded inSunan Ibn Majah 4337reflects not a divine revelation but a syncretic infusion ofpre-Islamic erotic mythology and demonological motifs. The figure of seventy infernal companions may symbolically correspond to ancient traditions of sexual demons and infernal spirits masquerading as houris.As such, theprophetic 'gift' attributed to Muhammad here appears less a reward from the One True God and more a lure rooted in the sensual and infernal imagination of Late Antiquity.For Christian scholars and interfaith theologians, this Hadith exemplifies the anthropomorphic tendencies of early Islamic eschatology and its occasional alignment with pagan, rather than Abrahamic, spiritual constructs.ReferencesSunan Ibn Majah 4337.In-book reference: Book 37, Hadith 238.

A Qur’anic and Theological AnalysisAuthor:Dr. Maxwell ShimbaAffiliation:Shimba Theological Institute & Max Shimba Ministries OrgAbstract:Muslim apologists often claim that Jesus Christ was sent only to the Jews, frequently citing Matthew 15:24 as evidence. However, a deeper examination of the Qur’an suggests that Muhammad’s mission was similarly limited—to the Arabs. This article offers a Qur’anic and theological exploration of ten key reasons derived from Islamic scripture to support the argument that Muhammad was a prophet specifically sent to the Arab people.IntroductionMuslims often assert that Jesus’ mission was restricted to the Jews, using Matthew 15:24:“I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel.”However, they seldom apply the same standard to Muhammad. A critical reading of the Qur’an reveals that Muhammad’s prophetic mission was confined to the Arabs. The Qur’an itself repeatedly emphasizes the cultural, linguistic, and geographic specificity of Muhammad’s mission. This paper presents ten Qur’anic reasons that substantiate this claim, structured for scholarly evaluation.1. Every Nation Has Its Own MessengerQur’anic Reference:Surah Yunus (10:47)\"And for every nation is a messenger. So when their messenger comes, it will be judged between them in justice, and they will not be wronged.\"Analysis:The verse clearly affirms that each nation (umma) receives its own specific messenger. If \"every nation\" means distinct people groups such as Africans, Indians, and Europeans, then Muhammad, as an Arab, was the messenger to Arabs alone.2. Messengers Are Sent in the Language of Their PeopleQur’anic Reference:Surah Ibrahim (14:4)\"And We did not send any messenger except [speaking] in the language of his people to state clearly for them.\"Analysis:This verse reinforces the idea that a prophet must share the linguistic and cultural context of his audience. Muhammad spoke Arabic and belonged to the Arab community; hence, his message was directed to Arabs.3. Every Nation Had Its Own Warning MessengerQur’anic Reference:Surah An-Nahl (16:36)\"And We certainly sent into every nation a messenger, [saying], 'Worship Allah and avoid Taghut.'\"Analysis:If God sent a messenger to every nation, then logically, Muhammad’s mission is localized to his own nation—the Arabs. Each messenger has a specific audience.4. Different Nations Receive Different LawsQur’anic Reference:Surah Al-Ma’idah (5:48)\"To each of you We prescribed a law and a method. Had Allah willed, He would have made you one nation...\"Analysis:This passage demonstrates theological pluralism within Islamic scripture, suggesting divine intent to give each nation its own laws and religious path. Thus, Muhammad’s Sharia was for his own people.5. Muhammad Was Sent to Warn a Nation Previously UnwarnedQur’anic Reference:Surah As-Sajda (32:2–3)\"It is a revelation from the Lord of the worlds. So that you may warn a people whose forefathers were not warned, so they are heedless.\"Analysis:This verse implies that Muhammad was sent to the Arabs, who had not previously received a prophet or scripture. The phrase “a people whose forefathers were not warned” cannot apply to Jews or Christians but to pagan Arabs.6. Muhammad Was One Among Many Prophets Sent to Their Own PeoplesQur’anic Reference:Surah Ya-Sin (36:2–6)\"Indeed, you are among the messengers, on a straight path... to warn a people whose forefathers were not warned.\"Analysis:Again, Muhammad is grouped among those messengers each sent to their own nations. The term “people whose fathers were not warned” aligns with the historical condition of the pre-Islamic Arabs.7. Arabs Were Given a Revelation to Avoid ExcusesQur’anic Reference:Surah Al-An'am (6:156–157)\"Lest you say: ‘The Scripture was only sent down to two groups before us...’\"Analysis:This implies that the Arabs could not claim ignorance, since a scripture (Qur’an) was now revealed to them, just as previous revelations were given to Jews and Christians. The message is clearly demarcated by ethnicity and geography.8. The Qur’an Was Revealed in Arabic for the ArabsQur’anic Reference:Surah Ash-Shu'ara (26:192–199)\"And indeed, it is the revelation of the Lord of the worlds... in a clear Arabic language... Had We revealed it to a non-Arab and he recited it to them, they would not have believed.\"Analysis:The Qur’an’s Arabic nature and its rejection by others if delivered in a different language confirm its intended audience was Arabs.9. The Qur’an Was Meant for Makkah and Its SurroundingsQur’anic Reference:Surah Al-An’am (6:92)\"This is a blessed Book which We have revealed, confirming what was before it, so that you may warn the Mother of Cities and those around it.\"Analysis:“Makkah” (the Mother of Cities) and its environs are explicitly mentioned. This limits the scope of Muhammad’s mission geographically to the Arabian Peninsula.10. Revelation in Arabic for the People Around MakkahQur’anic Reference:Surah Ash-Shura (42:7)\"And thus We have revealed to you an Arabic Qur’an that you may warn the Mother of Cities and those around it.\"Analysis:This verse confirms that the warning was for Makkah and its vicinity. The use of the Arabic language further limits the message to the region and people who spoke Arabic.ConclusionAccording to Islamic scripture itself, Muhammad was a prophet specifically sent to the Arab people. The Qur’an emphasizes his linguistic, cultural, and geographical connection to Arabia. It acknowledges a pattern in which each nation is given its own prophet, language, and divine law. Therefore, just as Muslims claim Jesus was sent only to the Jews, the Qur’an confirms that Muhammad was sent only to the Arabs. Any attempt to universalize Muhammad's mission contradicts the Qur’an's own repeated assertions.Keywords:Muhammad, Qur’an, Arabs, Prophethood, Sharia, Arabic language, Islamic theology, religious pluralism, Quranic interpretation, messenger to every nationCite as:Shimba, Maxwell.Was Muhammad Sent Only to the Arabs?

The paper culminates in a gospel-centered call to truth and freedom through Jesus Christ as the only way to salvation, referencing John 8:31 and John 14:6.IntroductionMuslims often find themselves in a difficult position when attempting to theologically defend Allah, especially when critical questions arise regarding the logic and coherence of Islamic doctrine. When faced with robust Christian arguments grounded in scripture and reason, many resort to mockery, deflection, or emotional outbursts rather than rational engagement. This paper aims to examine these critical points academically, particularly highlighting hidden inconsistencies in Islamic theology which are often obscured by Islamic clergy from their congregations. As Christians committed to sharing the truth in love, we must educate our Muslim brothers and sisters so they may come to know the truth, which, as Jesus promised, will set them free (John 8:31–32).Section I: The Paradox of Salawat – Praying for MuhammadAccording to Islamic hadith:“Whoever performs the ‘Asr prayer on Friday and says before standing up: ‘O Allah, send prayers upon Muhammad, the illiterate prophet, and upon his followers, and grant them eternal peace eighty times,’ he will be forgiven eighty years of sins.”—Al-Sadiqu Al-Amin, Vol. 1-2, Hadith No. 347, p. 160.Critical Questions:Who is worthy of intercession: the believer or the prophet?Why does the prophet demand salutation and blessings from the believers?Where in the Bible do we find Jesus asking for believers to pray for Him?Unlike Muhammad, Jesus never asked for such prayers. Instead, He prayed for His followers and offered Himself as the intercessor (John 17:9–26; Romans 8:34). The Islamic requirement to bless a deceased prophet raises theological concerns regarding the completeness and divinity of Muhammad’s mission.Furthermore, the idea that praying for Muhammad results in the forgiveness of 80 years of sin opens the door for moral abuse. Could this doctrine be behind the motivation of some extremists who believe that martyrdom or obedience to Muhammad’s traditions will earn them unearned righteousness?Section II: The Shocking Hadith – Will Allah Enter Hell?A major theological challenge arises from the following hadith:“Hell will continue saying, ‘Is there any more?’ until the Lord of Glory puts His Foot in it. Then it will say, ‘Enough! Enough! By Your Glory!’ and it will draw itself together.”—Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 8, Hadith No. 654This anthropomorphic description, where Allah physically places His foot in Hell to pacify it, presents numerous theological problems:Divine Vulnerability:A god who physically interacts with hell seems susceptible to spatial-temporal limitations.Theological Dissonance:The Christian God is the eternal Judge, distinct and separate from Hell, and will cast Satan and death itself into the lake of fire (Revelation 20:14).Deceptive Imagery:If Allah can enter Hell or interact with it materially, is he really distinct from creation? Or is this a mischaracterization of divinity?Section III: The Final Judgment – The Biblical View of Hell and God's SovereigntyThe Bible makes a clear distinction between the Creator and created realities, including Hell. In Matthew 25:41, Jesus says:“Then He will say to those on His left, ‘Depart from Me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.’”This verse establishes:Hell was never made for God or humanity but for the Devil and fallen angels.God is the supreme Judge who sends the wicked into Hell, not a being who interacts with Hell to calm it down.Likewise, in Revelation 20:11–15, we are told:The dead will be judged before God.Anyone whose name is not found in the Book of Life will be thrown into the lake of fire.Death and Hades (not God) are thrown into the lake of fire.There is no indication that God (Yahweh) ever steps into Hell or interacts with it as if it were alive.Section IV: A Call to Truth – The Real Identity of GodFrom the biblical evidence, the God revealed in Scripture (Yahweh) is holy, righteous, omnipotent, and transcendent. He is not confined by the limitations or anthropomorphic depictions found in certain Islamic texts. In fact, the idea that “Allah” enters Hell contradicts the very nature of divine transcendence and omnipotence.It therefore raises the possibility that the Islamic depiction of Allah is a counterfeit, a false deity masquerading as divine. This aligns with what Jesus said about false prophets and deceptions in the last days (Matthew 24:24; 2 Corinthians 11:14).Section V: The Way to Salvation – Jesus Christ AloneJesus Christ declares in John 14:6:“I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.”And in Revelation 3:20:“Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and dine with him, and he with Me.”Dear Muslim reader, Jesus Christ is calling you today. He does not ask you to pray for Him but instead invites you into a relationship with Him, where He intercedes for you. He is the only one whose name is written in the Book of Life, and through Him alone can your name also be written therein (Revelation 20:15).Conclusion: Choose Life TodayTo all seekers of truth: reflect deeply on these theological discrepancies. Question what you have been taught. Don’t settle for incomplete or inconsistent doctrines. True salvation and eternal life are found only in Jesus Christ.“You shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.” –John 8:32ReferencesThe Holy Bible, New King James Version (NKJV)Sahih al-Bukhari(Volume 8, Hadith 654)Al-Sadiqu Al-Amin, Vol. 1-2, Hadith No. 347Quranic interpretations (as referenced by Muslim scholars)Revelation 20:11–15, Matthew 25:41, John 3:16, John 14:6, Revelation 3:20Dr. Maxwell ShimbaFounder, Shimba Theological InstituteMax Shimba Ministries Org",

The verse asserts that those who manifest arrogance, even while outwardly engaging in worship, are destined for hell. This paper explores the semantic, theological, and exegetical dimensions of the term \"proud\" (Arabic:yastakbirūna) within Quranic theology, comparing it to biblical and Judaic views on pride. Furthermore, it challenges common contemporary Islamic narratives that assure salvation for Muslims merely on the basis of religious identity, highlighting Quranic and Hadith-based evidence that ultimate judgment is contingent on inner humility and submission to divine will rather than nominal affiliation. The paper concludes by reflecting on the universal theological principle that pride remains a damning sin across Abrahamic faith traditions.1. IntroductionReligious eschatology across Abrahamic traditions consistently condemns pride as a fundamental sin leading to damnation. In Islam, Quran 40:60 offers a particularly severe warning against arrogance, linking it directly with the fate of hellfire, even for those who engage in acts of worship. This text raises significant theological questions regarding the criteria for salvation in Islamic doctrine. Are professing Muslims exempt from condemnation due to their religious identity, or does the presence of pride negate the value of their worship and faith? This paper investigates these issues through an exegetical analysis of Quran 40:60 within its linguistic, contextual, and theological frameworks.2. Textual Analysis and TranslationThe verse in question, Quran 40:60, is rendered in several English translations as follows:“And your Lord says: ‘Call upon Me, and I will answer you. Indeed, those who are too proud to worship Me will enter Hell [rendered] humiliated.’”(Sahih International)In Arabic:وَقَالَ رَبُّكُمُ ادْعُونِي أَسْتَجِبْ لَكُمْ ۚ إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ عَنْ عِبَادَتِي سَيَدْخُلُونَ جَهَنَّمَ دَاخِرِينَKey terms for analysis:يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ (yastakbirūna): Those who act arrogantly, proudly, exalting themselves above.عِبَادَتِي (‘ibādatī): My worship, service, obedience.دَاخِرِينَ (dākhirīn): Abased, humiliated, in disgrace.The syntax unambiguously links arrogance with refusal or distortion of true worship, regardless of religious label or ritual participation.3. Exegetical and Theological InterpretationClassical exegetes like Ibn Kathir, Al-Qurtubi, and Al-Tabari concur thatyastakbirūna ‘an ‘ibādatīrefers to those whose arrogance prevents them from sincerely invoking and submitting to Allah. Notably, arrogance (kibr) is considered a severe inner sin, often hidden under external religiosity. Al-Ghazali inIhya Ulum al-Dinclassifies arrogance as an internal disease of the heart that invalidates acts of worship before God.Thus, a Muslim who outwardly prays, fasts, and performs rituals, but inwardly exalts themselves in pride, falls under this condemnation. This challenges popular Islamic soteriological claims that mere identity guarantees divine favor, and aligns with Quranic passages such as 4:123:“Paradise is not (obtained) by your wishful thinking nor by that of the People of the Scripture. Whoever does a wrong will be recompensed for it.”4. Comparative Theological ContextIn biblical theology, pride is also consistently condemned. Proverbs 16:18 declares:“Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.”Similarly, James 4:6 in the New Testament teaches:“God opposes the proud but shows favor to the humble.”Judaism’s Talmudic tradition (Avot 4:4) warns:“Be very, very humble, for the hope of man is the worm.”Thus, across Abrahamic faiths, pride acts as a moral and spiritual separator between man and God, leading to eschatological ruin.5. Implications for MuslimsQuran 40:60 stands as an unequivocal statement that no external religious affiliation immunizes one from hell if inner pride corrupts the heart. The verse demands that Muslims critically self-examine their spiritual posture, prioritizing humility over outward religiosity.It serves as a polemic against Islamic triumphalism — the presumption that Muslims are categorically destined for paradise. Muhammad himself warned:“No one who has an atom’s weight of pride in his heart will enter Paradise.”(Sahih Muslim 91)This authentic Hadith corroborates the Quranic position that pride is a salvific disqualifier.6. ConclusionQuran 40:60 profoundly asserts that pride nullifies worship and merits hellfire, regardless of one’s religious identity. This principle resonates with parallel teachings in biblical and Judaic theology, reaffirming the universal danger of arrogance before God. The verse demands a theology of humility, challenging both Muslims and adherents of other faiths to forsake spiritual pride and embrace sincere submission to the Creator. It refutes popularized Islamic exclusivism that assumes salvation based on mere confession without internal transformation.This analysis demonstrates that — according to the Quran itself — proud Muslims, like any other proud individual, are destined for hell unless redeemed by humility and repentance. It calls for honest interfaith dialogue on the nature of pride, worship, and divine judgment.ReferencesThe Quran (40:60; 4:123; 16:23)Sahih Muslim, Hadith 91Al-Ghazali,Ihya Ulum al-DinIbn Kathir,Tafsir al-Qur'an al-AzimAl-Tabari,Jami’ al-BayanAl-Qurtubi,Tafsir al-Jami' li-Ahkam al-Qur'anProverbs 16:18, Holy BibleJames 4:6, Holy BibleTalmud Bavli, Avot 4:4",

    "full_content": "The Relationship Between Muhammad and Khadija: Historical, Social, and Personal DynamicsBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba | Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis paper critically examines the early marital relationship between Muhammad and Khadija bint Khuwaylid within the context of 7th-century Arabian society. Using classical Islamic sources and historical reports, this study explores the circumstances that led to their marriage, the underlying personal and social motivations, and how these dynamics influenced Muhammad’s later marital decisions. Questions are raised regarding the sincerity of Muhammad’s affection toward Khadija, his interest in her wealth, and his post-Khadija marital behavior. The analysis also addresses whether Muhammad's later choices reflected earlier suppressed desires and whether his marriage to Khadija was driven more by circumstance than romantic conviction.IntroductionThe marriage between Muhammad, later the founder of Islam, and Khadija bint Khuwaylid has often been presented in Islamic tradition as a union of mutual respect and affection. However, closer textual and contextual scrutiny suggests nuanced socio-economic and personal motivations behind this relationship. Khadija, a wealthy merchant widow significantly older than Muhammad, proposed marriage to him under circumstances revealing both her admiration for his character and the societal challenges posed by her status as an aging, twice-widowed woman.This study presents a reconstructed narrative based on traditional Islamic historiography and hadith literature and then critically examines its implications.Narrative Account: Khadija's Proposal to MuhammadKhadija, described in this narrative as an elderly woman without teeth, wrestled internally with the thought:“Could Muhammad possibly agree to marry me?”After extensive deliberation, she resolved to convey her feelings to Muhammad. Despite considering the matter a fanciful dream, she acknowledged its feasibility, though she was troubled by doubts:\"Who could deliver my proposal? Would Muhammad, in his youth, accept an elderly woman like me?\"At that moment, a knock came at the door. It was her sister, Halah, who greeted her warmly. Halah, upon being welcomed, revealed she had experienced a disturbing dream where Khadija wandered in darkness, guided by a voice urging her forward. This prompted her visit to inquire about Khadija's well-being.Khadija admitted:\"To be honest, I have been consumed by thoughts of Muhammad, pondering his virtues and character unmatched among the Quraysh.\"Halah encouraged her:\"Then propose to him.\"But Khadija confessed her fears:\"I’m afraid he might reject me because of my age. I have been married twice, and he is a young man of twenty-five, yet to marry. How could he accept a woman as old as his mother, with children of her own?\"Halah advised:\"Who first introduced Muhammad to you for business?\"Khadija answered:\"My friend Nafisa.\"Halah responded:\"Then Nafisa should deliver your proposal.\"Thus, the groundwork for the marriage was set.Muhammad’s Social Position and Personal ConsiderationsAt the time, Muhammad was an orphan of modest means, having lived with various relatives throughout his youth. Life offered him little stability. From this position of social uncertainty, marriage to a wealthy, respected woman like Khadija presented an invaluable opportunity for security and social elevation.Textual Evidence: Muhammad’s Preference for Younger WivesA revealing passage fromSahih al-Bukhari, Volume 3, Book 34, Hadith 310offers insight into Muhammad’s personal inclinations. On one occasion, he asked Jarir ibn Abdullah:\"Have you married?\"Jarir replied affirmatively.Muhammad then asked:\"A virgin or a matron?\"Jarir responded:\"A matron.\"Muhammad remarked:\"Why didn’t you marry a virgin so that you may play with her and she with you?\"This explicit preference suggests that Muhammad may have favored younger brides, who would offer companionship and lighthearted interaction, raising questions about his emotional investment in Khadija.Analytical Questions and Critical ReflectionsBased on this narrative and supporting textual evidence, several critical inquiries emerge:Did Muhammad Truly Love Khadija?The text implies that Muhammad’s acceptance of Khadija’s proposal was driven more by socio-economic necessity than romantic affection. The hadith regarding his preference for virgins further suggests that his emotional fulfillment may not have been fully met in this marriage.Was Muhammad Primarily Attracted to Khadija’s Wealth?Khadija was a prominent businesswoman of Mecca. Her wealth and status offered Muhammad financial security, business opportunities, and social standing — factors arguably contributing to his consent.Did Muhammad Orchestrate Khadija’s Death to Pursue His Desires?While no historical record directly accuses Muhammad of causing Khadija’s death, the timing of his subsequent marriages, particularly to much younger brides like Aisha, raises speculative questions about suppressed desires and motivations possibly deferred during Khadija’s lifetime.Why Did Muhammad Marry Multiple Wives Only After Khadija’s Death?The immediate proliferation of marital unions following Khadija’s death might suggest that Muhammad, restrained during her lifetime — perhaps out of obligation or respect — seized the opportunity for personal freedom upon her passing.ConclusionThis critical examination of Muhammad’s marriage to Khadija, viewed through the lenses of socio-economic realities, personal desires, and textual evidence, reveals a complex interplay of duty, opportunity, and suppressed inclination. While Islamic tradition venerates this marriage as one of loyalty and partnership, historical scrutiny suggests it may have been more circumstantial than affection-driven. Muhammad’s later marital behavior, including his explicit preference for younger brides, reinforces the notion that his union with Khadija may not have aligned with his deeper personal desires.ReferencesSahih al-Bukhari, Volume 3, Book 34, Hadith 310.Ibn Ishaq.Sirat Rasul Allah(The Life of Muhammad), trans.

    "full_content": "Title:Who Introduced Islam? An Analytical Review of Islamic and Christian Historical ClaimsBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba | Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractA longstanding debate persists between Muslim and Christian communities regarding the origin of Islam. Muslims claim that Islam existed since the creation of the universe, practiced by all prophets from Adam to Muhammad. Conversely, Christians argue that Islam emerged four thousand years after Jesus Christ, with Muhammad as its founder. This paper examines Islamic sources—including the Qur’an, Sahih al-Bukhari, Sahih Muslim, and respected biographical literature on Muhammad—to determine whether Islam predates Muhammad or whether it was instituted by him in the 7th century. The study concludes by posing a reflective theological question on who truly became the first Muslim between Muhammad and his wife Khadija, based on documented Islamic traditions.IntroductionFor centuries, Islamic and Christian communities have debated the historical and theological origins of Islam. On one side, Muslim scholarship maintains that Islam is an eternal religion instituted by God since the creation of Adam, upheld by every prophet that followed. On the other hand, Christian theologians and historians contest this claim, asserting that Islam was established in the 7th century CE by Muhammad in Arabia. This study seeks to clarify these claims by analyzing both the Qur’anic texts and early Islamic historical records, focusing on the formation of Islam as an organized religious system and identifying its earliest adherents.Textual Analysis from Islamic SourcesTo ascertain the veracity of these claims, we turn first to the Qur’an and its exegesis. In the interpretation of Surah Yusuf (12:19–20) as found in the Kiswahili edition of the Qur’an (third edition, Juzuu 12, page 311), the commentary acknowledges that over 4000 years elapsed before the arrival of the religion brought by Prophet Muhammad. This indicates, within certain Islamic commentaries, that Islam, as an institutionalized religion, was introduced by Muhammad himself.Additionally, canonical hadith collections such asSahih al-BukhariandSahih Muslim, along with various writings by eminent Islamic scholars, affirm this understanding. A critical example is drawn from the biographical textMaisha ya Nabii Muhammad (Life of Prophet Muhammad)by the late Sheikh Abdullah Saleh Al-Farsy, the former Chief Kadhi of Zanzibar and later Kenya.On page 18 of this text, it is recorded that upon receiving his first revelation, Muhammad returned home and confided in his wife, Khadija bint Khuwaylid. She immediately believed in him, thereby becoming the first person to profess the Shahada (Islamic declaration of faith). The text explicitly states:\"She was the very first Muslim.\"The same book lists the earliest Muslims chronologically as follows:Khadija bint Khuwaylid— First person to embrace Islam upon Muhammad’s invitation.Ali ibn Abi Talib— Muhammad’s cousin, who initially hesitated but later declared his faith.Zayd ibn Haritha— Muhammad’s adopted son.Baraka bint Tha'laba (Umm Ayman)— Muhammad’s nursemaid.The historical record situates the formal beginning of Islam as a religious movement onMonday, the 17th of Ramadan, equivalent to27th December, 610 CE. Prior to this date, there existed no structured religious system identified as Islam.Historical and Theological ImplicationGiven these Islamic sources, it becomes clear that institutional Islam—characterized by specific rituals, beliefs, and the Shahada—originated with Muhammad. While Islamic theology retrospectively projects Islam onto earlier prophets, the organized practice labeled as Islam began in the 7th century.This reality prompts a reflective theological question:Who was truly the first Muslim—Muhammad or his wife Khadija?If Khadija accepted Islam the moment Muhammad shared his experience and professed the Shahada before him, then logically, based on Islamic tradition itself, Khadija would hold the distinction of being the first Muslim.ConclusionThis analysis reveals that, according to documented Islamic sources, the structured religion of Islam as it is known today was introduced by Prophet Muhammad in the 7th century CE. While Islamic theology maintains a belief in Islam’s primordial existence through earlier prophets, the practical and communal establishment of the faith began during Muhammad’s lifetime.The evidence further suggests that Khadija bint Khuwaylid was, by Islamic historical accounts, the first individual to accept Islam, even before Muhammad publicly proclaimed it to others. This raises a profound theological reflection within Islamic history about the origins of faith adherence in the early Muslim community.Keywords:Islamic history, Prophet Muhammad, Khadija bint Khuwaylid, Islam origin, Islamic theology, early Muslim converts, Qur’an, Sahih al-Bukhari, Abdullah Saleh Al-Farsy, 610 CE, religious origins, Islamic tradition.",

    "full_content": "Title:A Critical Theological and Historical Examination of Islamic Claims to Abrahamic Origins and the Primacy of the KaabaBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba | Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractIslamic tradition asserts that Islam is the original faith of the Prophet Abraham and that the Kaaba in Mecca is the first house of worship appointed for humanity. These claims, derived predominantly from the Qur'an and Islamic exegesis, are foundational to Muslim identity and belief. However, a critical examination of available historical, biblical, and theological records reveals significant inconsistencies and evidentiary gaps. This paper interrogates three core Islamic assertions: (1) that Islam was the religion of Abraham, (2) that the Kaaba was the first house of worship for humankind, and (3) that Muhammad was a true prophet of God in continuity with the biblical prophets. The study draws upon scriptural, historical, and logical critique to evaluate these claims, proposing that Islam's historical narrative concerning Abrahamic tradition is a constructed apologetic rather than a verifiable historical continuum.IntroductionIslam’s theological framework rests upon its asserted continuity with Abrahamic monotheism. The Qur'an frequently invokes Abraham (Ibrahim) as a monotheistic patriarch who predates Judaism and Christianity, claiming Islam to be the restoration of his original faith. Moreover, it attributes primordial religious significance to the Kaaba, declaring it the first house of worship appointed for mankind (Qur'an 3:96). These assertions, however, invite critical scrutiny, particularly regarding the absence of corroborating records predating the 7th century CE. This article rigorously examines these foundational claims through theological, scriptural, and historical lenses.I. Was Islam the Religion of Abraham?A. Absence of Historical Records Confirming Islamic Practice by AbrahamThe Qur'an claims inQur'an 3:95that Abraham followed the same religion as later Muslims, though neither the Hebrew Bible nor any pre-Islamic historical source records Abraham professing the Shahada, performing Salah, paying Zakat, fasting Ramadan, or making pilgrimage (Hajj) to the Kaaba. These are essential Islamic practices, yet no documentation exists in Jewish, Christian, or independent historical archives demonstrating Abraham's observance of these rites.Questions posed:Where are historical records verifying Islam as Abraham's religion?Where did Abraham declare Shahada or practice the five pillars of Islam?No credible pre-Qur'anic source substantiates these practices.B. Abraham's Descendants and the Absence of Islamic PracticeAbraham fathered eight sons: Ishmael, Isaac, Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah (Genesis 25:1-6). None are recorded in biblical, historical, or extra-biblical literature as practitioners of Islam. Notably:Israelite priesthood was established through the tribe of Levi, not through an Islamic framework (Exodus 28:1-3).Neither Ishmaelites nor Israelites practiced Shahada, Salah, Zakat, Ramadan fasting, or Hajj to Mecca.C. The Prophetic Lineage and Absence of Islamic RitualsFrom Adam, Noah, and Enoch to Jesus Christ, no record exists of Islamic practices among these figures. The consistent religious expression recorded in Hebrew Scriptures involves animal sacrifices, altar-building, and temple worship — all absent from Islamic ritual forms until their later codification by Muhammad.II. Is the Kaaba the First House of Worship for Humanity?A. Absence of Biblical or Historical Visits to the KaabaAccording toQur'an 3:96, the Kaaba is \"the first house of worship for mankind.\" Yet no biblical prophet, including Adam, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, David, Solomon, or Jesus, is recorded to have visited, worshipped at, or acknowledged the Kaaba.The Israelites, after leaving Egypt, constructed the Tabernacle at Mount Sinai as instructed by Yahweh (Exodus 25–27).God later commanded Solomon to build a temple in Jerusalem, not a pilgrimage to Mecca (1 Kings 6).Questions posed:Why did God never command Moses or Israel to worship at the Kaaba?Why is the Kaaba absent from all Hebrew and Christian canonical writings if it were of primordial significance?B. Israelite Worship CentersFrom the Tabernacle to Solomon’s Temple, biblical theology centered on Jerusalem, not Mecca. No command exists in Old Testament scriptures for Israelites to face or journey toward Mecca. This contradicts Islam’s claim of the Kaaba's primacy.III. Is Muhammad a True Prophet in Continuity with Biblical Prophets?A. Muhammad’s Pagan Origins and the Black StoneMuhammad was born into a polytheistic Quraysh society, which housed 360 idols at the Kaaba. Prior to Islam’s founding, he participated in the installation of the Black Stone in the Kaaba’s eastern corner (circa 605 CE). Even after Islam’s conquest of Mecca, Muhammad preserved the Black Stone, a relic of pre-Islamic Arabian paganism, contradicting biblical monotheism’s rejection of idolatrous objects (Deuteronomy 4:16-19).Questions posed:Why did Muhammad retain the Black Stone if Islam was pure monotheism?Why did no biblical prophet bow to or venerate a stone object?B. Theological Inconsistencies in Muhammad’s ClaimsInQur'an 6:76-78, Abraham momentarily recognizes a star, the moon, and the sun as possible deities before rejecting them. This depiction diverges from the biblical Abraham who, from the outset, recognizes the singular Yahweh (Genesis 12:1-8).The Qur'anic portrayal inadvertently paints Abraham as a temporary pagan — a theological flaw given Islam’s assertion that he was a pure monotheist from the beginning.Observation:If Abraham’s initial recognition of celestial objects as lords is polytheistic, how does Islam maintain that he was never a pagan, perQur'an 3:95?ConclusionA thorough historical-theological analysis reveals substantial evidentiary gaps and theological inconsistencies in Islam's claim to Abrahamic continuity. Neither Jewish nor Christian scriptures — nor any credible historical source — affirm that Abraham practiced Islam or that the Kaaba was the first house of worship. Furthermore, Muhammad’s personal history, his handling of pagan relics like the Black Stone, and his retroactive theological claims raise legitimate doubts about the authenticity of his prophetic office in the biblical tradition.Final Thought:Without external, pre-Islamic corroboration of Islam’s Abrahamic origins or the Kaaba’s primordial status, the Qur’anic narrative appears as a post hoc construct designed to grant theological legitimacy to Islam by appropriating Jewish and Christian figures and narratives. This, combined with Muhammad’s socio-religious context and theological divergences, positions Islam not as a restoration but as a reinterpretation and revision of Abrahamic monotheism.ReferencesThe Holy Bible (Genesis 12–25; Exodus 25–40; 1 Kings 6)The Qur'an (Surah 3:95-96; 6:75-79)Ibn Ishaq,Sirat Rasul AllahWatt, W.

    "full_content": "Who Is the Allah of Muhammad? A Theological and Ethical Analysis of Muhammad’s Relation to the Ten CommandmentsBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis article critically examines the identity of Allah as introduced by Muhammad in early Islam, in comparison to the God of Israel (YHWH) as revealed in the Hebrew Bible. It investigates whether Muhammad, as claimed by Muslims, was a prophet of the same God who sent Moses, or whether he invented a new deity and religious system that violated the foundational moral and spiritual laws revealed in the Ten Commandments. By analyzing Muhammad’s actions and teachings against the Decalogue, this study reveals significant theological and moral discrepancies between biblical prophetic standards and Muhammad’s life and practices.1. IntroductionIslamic theology posits Muhammad as the final prophet in a lineage that includes Moses, David, and Jesus, sent by Allah — a deity Muslims claim is the same as the God of the Bible. This assertion merits critical examination against the ethical and theological framework established in the Torah, specifically the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20:1–17). If Muhammad indeed operated under the authority of the God of Israel, his life and religious reforms should conform to the moral laws previously revealed. This study will analyze Muhammad’s actions against each commandment to assess these claims.2. The Ten Commandments and Muhammad: A Comparative Ethical Review2.1. The First Commandment“You shall have no other gods before Me.” (Exodus 20:3)Historical sources (Quran 27:91; Sahih al-Bukhari; Musnad Ahmad Hadith 2506) indicate that Muhammad’s early association with the Kaaba, which housed 360 idols, including the chief idolHubal, contradicts this commandment. Even after Islam’s emergence, the Black Stone (Hajar al-Aswad) remained an object of veneration (cf. Sahih al-Bukhari, Book 25). Unlike biblical prophets who worshipped YHWH exclusively, Muhammad’s theological innovations centered around a deity identified with pre-Islamic Arabian idolatry, contradicting monotheistic fidelity.2.2. The Second Commandment“You shall not make for yourself a carved image…” (Exodus 20:4)The erection and ritual veneration of the Black Stone at the eastern corner of the Kaaba violate this law. Islamic sources affirm Muhammad’s reverence for the Black Stone (Sahih al-Bukhari 2:667), a practice alien to biblical prophetic tradition. The Kaaba itself was a shrine for numerous idols before Islam, and the Black Stone remained a focal point of worship post-Islam.2.3. The Third Commandment“You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain.” (Exodus 20:7)By attributing divine authority to the deityAllah, whom he redefined from Arabian pagan tradition, Muhammad’s claim that this being was the God of Moses constitutes a theological misrepresentation. The Quran (e.g., 27:91) and Hadith sources demonstrate a theological divergence from YHWH, particularly in moral character and covenantal promises.2.4. The Fourth Commandment“Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.” (Exodus 20:8-11)The Quran and Hadith are devoid of any observance of the biblical Sabbath by Muhammad. Instead, he instituted Friday (Jumu'ah) prayers (Sahih al-Bukhari, Book 13), severing continuity with the Mosaic Law. Moreover, Islamic records do not document Muhammad honoring his mother Amina or his foster-father, an essential moral expectation within the Decalogue.2.5. The Fifth Commandment“Honor your father and your mother.” (Exodus 20:12)Historical accounts and Hadith literature record no explicit narrative of Muhammad honoring his deceased parents in a biblically consistent manner. This commandment, deeply embedded in Hebrew tradition and culture, appears neglected in the Prophet’s documented personal ethics.2.6. The Sixth Commandment“You shall not murder.” (Exodus 20:13)Islamic texts report multiple sanctioned killings under Muhammad’s command (Sunan Abu Dawud 2665; Quran 33:26-27), including executions of Jews in Medina (Banu Qurayza tribe) and assassinations of critics and poets. These actions starkly contrast with biblical prophetic conduct, where human life was sanctified and murder condemned.2.7. The Seventh Commandment“You shall not commit adultery.” (Exodus 20:14)Muhammad’s marital history includes multiple wives and concubines, alongside reported relationships with captive women post-battle (Sahih al-Bukhari, Book 62). The Quran itself (33:37) records the incident involving Zaynab, the wife of his adopted son Zayd, which led to divine approval for their marriage after Zayd’s divorce — a case of moral compromise by biblical standards.2.8. The Eighth Commandment“You shall not steal.” (Exodus 20:15)Raids on merchant caravans (e.g., the Nakhla raid) and the confiscation of property from Jewish tribes in Medina (Quran 33:27) contradict this commandment. These actions were justified as spoils of war but violate the biblical prohibition against theft.2.9. The Ninth Commandment“You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.” (Exodus 20:16)The Quran and Hadith record accusations against Jews, Christians, and earlier prophets, including claims inconsistent with biblical revelation. Muhammad’s re-narration of biblical history (e.g., the altered portrayal of Ishmael’s role in Abraham’s story) constitutes false testimony by Judeo-Christian canonical standards.2.10. The Tenth Commandment“You shall not covet…” (Exodus 20:17)The incident involving Muhammad’s desire for Zaynab (Quran 33:37) illustrates a direct breach of this commandment. His subsequent marriage to her, following her divorce from Zayd, signifies covetous behavior incompatible with prophetic holiness as modeled in the Hebrew Scriptures.3. ConclusionThe ethical and theological review presented herein evidences Muhammad’s consistent violations of the Ten Commandments as revealed through Moses. These findings challenge the Islamic assertion that Muhammad was a prophet in the same spiritual and moral lineage as Moses, David, and Jesus. Furthermore, this analysis raises critical questions about the origin and identity of Allah as worshipped in Islam, revealing significant divergences from YHWH, the God of Israel.Before Muslims challenge the integrity of the Bible, Christianity, or the Apostle Paul, it is imperative they first account for these fundamental ethical transgressions by Muhammad against the immutable moral law of the Decalogue.ReferencesThe Holy Bible, Exodus 20:1–17The Quran (various verses)Sahih al-Bukhari (multiple volumes)Sunan Abu Dawud, Hadith 2665Musnad Ahmad, Hadith 2506Ibn Ishaq’sSirat Rasul AllahAl-Tabari’sTarikh al-Rusul wa’l-Muluk",

    "full_content": "What Is Islam? A Critical Theological and Historical Analysis of Islam’s Origins and ClaimsBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba | Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis paper critically examines the theological claims of Islam as formulated by Muhammad, interrogating the Qur'anic, Hadithic, and historical evidences that Muslims often cite to authenticate their religion. It argues that the foundational constructs of Islam, including the identity of Allah, the authenticity of the Qur'an, the role of Jibril (Gabriel), and the prophetic status of Muhammad, are inventions rooted in Arabian paganism and distorted Judeo-Christian narratives. The study employs a comparative theological approach by juxtaposing Qur'anic claims with biblical scriptures, especially in examining Qur'an 48:29’s assertion of foreheads marked by prostration in the Law (Taurat) and Gospel (Injeel). The paper concludes by affirming the messianic work of Jesus Christ as prophesied in Isaiah 53, offering salvation in contrast to the theological constructs of Islam.IntroductionIslam, professed by over a billion adherents globally, claims divine origin through revelations allegedly given by Allah to Muhammad via the angel Jibril (Gabriel). Central to Islamic theology is the belief that Muhammad is the final prophet, the Qur'an is the literal word of God, and the Kaaba in Mecca is the holiest site ordained by divine decree. However, a closer examination of Islamic primary sources—specifically the Qur'an, Hadith collections, and early Islamic historiography—reveals significant theological, historical, and logical inconsistencies. This paper contends that Islam is a syncretic religion shaped by pre-Islamic Arabian paganism and borrowed Judeo-Christian elements, packaged under the authority of Muhammad.1. The Claim of Islam’s Divine Origin: An Internal ContradictionThe Qur'an claims that \"the religion before Allah is Islam\" (Qur'an 3:19), asserting Islam as the primordial faith of humanity. However, historical scrutiny reveals that the termIslamin the sense of a structured religion emerged only through Muhammad’s prophetic claims in 7th-century Arabia. The invocation of earlier scriptural communities (People of the Book) as having rejected Islam out of envy presupposes the prior existence of Islam, which no historical or biblical evidence substantiates.Qur'an 3:19\"The religion before Allah is Islam. Nor did the People of the Book refuse it except through envy, after knowledge had come to them.\"This suggests an anachronism, as neither Judaic nor Christian texts reference \"Islam\" as a divinely instituted faith preceding Muhammad.2. The Invention of Allah and the Idol of HubalPre-Islamic Mecca housed a pantheon of idols at the Kaaba, including the chief deity Hubal. Historical and archaeological evidence identifies Allah as a high god among Arabian deities, associated with the Moon. The Qur'an inadvertently preserves this legacy inQur'an 38:5–7, where critics of Muhammad accuse him of consolidating various gods into one:Qur'an 38:5–7\"Has he made the gods [only] one Allah? Indeed, this is a curious thing.\"The passage confirms the existence of polytheistic worship before Islam, contradicting the Qur'an's later monotheistic claims.3. The Fabrication of Jibril (Gabriel)The Qur'an frequently mentions Jibril as the angelic intermediary delivering Allah’s revelations to Muhammad (e.g.,Qur'an 2:97). However, the biblical Gabriel serves as a messenger to Daniel and Mary, never associated with delivering scripture. Muhammad’s Jibril is a reappropriation of Judeo-Christian angelology.Qur'an 2:97\"Whoever is an enemy to Jibril—it is [none but] he who has brought it [the Qur'an] down upon your heart by permission of Allah...\"This divergence points to a manufactured narrative, borrowing the name Gabriel to authenticate Muhammad’s revelations.4. The Qur'an’s Borrowing from Biblical TextsEarly Islamic historiography acknowledges that Muhammad was influenced by Waraqa ibn Nawfal, a Christian monk who allegedly taught him biblical stories.Qur'an 16:102–103admits accusations that a human source instructed Muhammad:Qur'an 16:103\"We know that they say, 'It is only a human being who teaches him.' The tongue of the one they refer to is foreign, yet this [Qur'an] is in clear Arabic language.\"Despite claiming divine origin, the Qur'an’s content reflects distorted and recontextualized biblical narratives.5. Muhammad’s Self-Investiture as ProphetInQur'an 48:29, Muhammad declares himself the Apostle of Allah, describing his followers as marked by their prostrations—a claim said to find precedent in the Torah and Gospel.Qur'an 48:29\"Muhammad is the Apostle of Allah, and those with him are severe against disbelievers, and merciful among themselves. You see them bowing and prostrating, seeking bounty from Allah... Their mark is on their faces from the traces of prostration. That is their likeness in the Torah and their likeness in the Gospel...\"This claim demands biblical evidence:Question 1:Where is the evidence in the Old Testament (Torah) that people have a mark on their foreheads from prostration?Answer: No Old Testament passage supports this. Marks in the Old Testament (e.g.,Ezekiel 9:4) signify divine protection from judgment, not physical traces from prayer.Question 2:Where is the evidence in the New Testament (Gospel) of such a mark?Answer: No New Testament passage attributes physical marks on foreheads from prayer. The Book of Revelation (7:3, 14:1) speaks of a symbolic seal of God on the foreheads of the righteous but unrelated to physical prostration marks.Question 3:If Muslims argue the Taurat and Injil are separate from the Bible, where are these texts?Answer: No independent, authenticated pre-Islamic texts titled \"Taurat\" and \"Injil\" exist outside the Bible. Islam itself acknowledges the Torah as revealed to Moses and the Gospel to Jesus, corresponding to the Old and New Testaments.6. Theological Synthesis: Muhammad as Allah, Jibril, and the Qur'anic AuthorIslamic narratives blur the distinction between Muhammad, Jibril, and Allah. Given Muhammad's exclusive claim to receive revelation through Jibril—whom no one else witnessed—the possibility arises of a constructed religious system where Muhammad functioned as prophet, angel, and deity figurehead.Further,Sahih al-Bukhari 5:58:206describes pre-Islamic Mecca’s idol worship centered around the Kaaba’s 360 idols, including the Black Stone—a practice Islam continues by venerating the Kaaba, which originally housed idols.7. Christ’s Redemptive Work: The Biblical AlternativeIn stark contrast, the Bible proclaims Jesus Christ as the divine Son of God, whose atoning death and resurrection fulfill the prophecy ofIsaiah 53:1–12. Unlike Muhammad’s militaristic and legalistic theology, Christ offers grace and salvation:Isaiah 53:5\"But he was wounded for our transgressions, bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes, we are healed.\"This Messianic prophecy underscores Christianity's emphasis on redemption through divine self-sacrifice rather than human works.ConclusionThis study demonstrates that Islam's theological foundation is rooted in pre-Islamic paganism, biblical distortions, and Muhammad's self-serving claims. It exposes the inconsistencies between Qur'anic assertions and both historical fact and biblical revelation. The paper calls readers to reconsider Islam’s claims in light of scriptural evidence and embrace the redemptive work of Jesus Christ as the only path to salvation.ReferencesQur'an 3:19; 38:5–7; 2:97; 16:102–103; 48:29Sahih al-Bukhari 5:58:206Holy Bible: Isaiah 53:1–12; Ezekiel 9:4; Revelation 7:3; 14:1",

Through a close exegetical analysis of the Qur'anic text, supported by classical Islamic commentaries and historical records, the paper demonstrates that the Qur'an recognizes the Jewish people's ancestral and divine claim to the Land of Israel. Furthermore, this study reveals that the termPalestinenever appears in the Qur'an, nor was such a political entity or ethno-national identity recognized during the time of Muhammad. This analysis corrects prevalent misconceptions and offers a scripturally grounded perspective on the issue of Israel’s legitimacy within Islamic thought.1. IntroductionThe ongoing geopolitical conflict between Israel and various regional actors has often been framed through religious and historical narratives. Among Muslims, the question of rightful ownership of the land commonly calledPalestineis frequently contested. However, a meticulous reading of Islamic scripture, particularlyQur'an 5:21, reveals a consistent acknowledgment of Jewish sovereignty over the Holy Land. This article aims to present a scholarly, text-based examination of this assertion, emphasizing that Allah Himself decreed the land to the Children of Israel. Furthermore, it argues that the modern concept ofPalestineas a national or ethnic entity did not exist during Muhammad’s lifetime, nor does it find mention in the Qur'anic text.2. Qur'an 5:21 and the Divine Grant to the Children of IsraelThe key passage for this study isQur'an 5:21, which reads:يَا قَوْمِ ادْخُلُوا الْأَرْضَ الْمُقَدَّسَةَ الَّتِي كَتَبَ اللَّهُ لَكُمْ وَلَا تَرْتَدُّوا عَلَى أَدْبَارِكُمْ فَتَنقَلِبُوا خَاسِرِينَ“O my people, enter the Holy Land which Allah has assigned to you and do not turn back, or you will become losers.”(Qur'an 5:21, Sahih International)In this verse, Moses addresses the Children of Israel, commanding them to enter the Holy Land (al-ard al-muqaddasah) which Allah hasassigned (kataba)to them. The Arabic termkatabaimplies a binding decree or divine ordinance, indicating that the land was granted to the Jewish people by divine will.Classical Islamic exegetessuch asIbn Kathir,Al-Tabari, andAl-Qurtubiconcur that this land refers to the region historically known as the Land of Canaan, later Judea and Israel. Ibn Kathir, in hisTafsir, explicitly states:“It is the land of Ash-Sham, specifically Bayt al-Maqdis (Jerusalem) and its surrounding areas, which Allah wrote for the Children of Israel.”Thus, according to both the Qur'anic text and authoritative Islamic exegesis, the Jewish people were divinely assigned this territory.3. Absence of \"Palestine\" in the Qur'an and Early Islamic HistoryNotably, the termPalestine(فلسطين) never appears in the Qur'an. At no point does the Islamic holy text refer to a nation, people, or territory by that name. During the Prophet Muhammad’s lifetime (570–632 CE), the area encompassing modern Israel was known in Greco-Roman usage asProvincia Syria Palaestina, a designation made by the Roman Emperor Hadrian in 135 CE following the suppression of the Bar Kokhba Jewish revolt.Islamic historiography, as documented in early texts such asAl-Baladhuri’s Futuh al-BuldanandIbn Ishaq’s Sirat Rasul Allah, references the region asBayt al-Maqdis,Iliya(from Aelia Capitolina, the Roman name for Jerusalem), orBilad al-Sham(Greater Syria). Nowhere is it calledPalestine, nor is there any recognition of a distinct Palestinian identity.The absence of this terminology in the Qur'an is significant, indicating that Islamic scripture recognizes territorial continuity associated with earlier Abrahamic traditions, particularly the Jewish claim to the land.4. Theological Implications and Modern MisinterpretationsModern Islamic political rhetoric often invokes religious sentiment against Israel by framing the conflict as a religiously mandated struggle overPalestinianland. However, this position lacks scriptural support within the Qur'an. On the contrary,Qur'an 5:21establishes a clear divine grant to the Jewish people.Even subsequent Qur'anic passages (e.g.,Qur'an 7:137andQur'an 17:104) reaffirm the idea that Allah favored the Children of Israel with this land:“And We caused the people who were oppressed to inherit the eastern and western parts of the land, which We had blessed.”(Qur'an 7:137)“And We said to the Children of Israel after Pharaoh: 'Dwell in the land, and when the promise of the Hereafter comes to pass, We shall bring you as a mixed gathering.’”(Qur'an 17:104)These verses confirm a Qur'anic pattern that associates Jewish people with the Holy Land, making contemporary claims of exclusive Muslim entitlement to the territory theologically untenable from a Qur'anic perspective.5. ConclusionA careful, text-based analysis of the Qur'an reveals that the Jewish people hold a divinely sanctioned claim to the Holy Land, as articulated inQur'an 5:21. Neither the termPalestinenor any Palestinian national or ethnic identity appears in the Qur'an or early Islamic sources. The Qur'anic position, corroborated by classical Islamic scholars, situates Jewish ownership of the land within a divine covenantal framework that modern political narratives cannot easily dismiss.This study calls for an honest, scripture-based discourse among Muslim and Jewish communities alike, recognizing the textual evidence within Islamic scripture itself.ReferencesThe Qur'an, Sahih International Translation.Ibn Kathir,Tafsir al-Qur'an al-Azim.Al-Tabari,Jami' al-Bayan fi Ta'wil al-Qur'an.Al-Qurtubi,Al-Jami' li-Ahkam al-Qur'an.Al-Baladhuri,Futuh al-Buldan.Ibn Ishaq,Sirat Rasul Allah.Wensinck, A.

    "full_content": "The Cultural Significance of Wanja (Kohl) and Lip Coloring in Ancient Arabian Traditions: A Critical Examination of Muhammad’s Use of CosmeticsBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba | Max Shimba Ministries OrgAbstractCosmetic practices such as the application ofwanja(kohl) and lip coloring have historically been associated with feminine beauty rituals and symbolic communication in various ancient cultures. This paper explores the historical roots of these practices in ancient Arabian society, their cultural meanings, and the implications of Prophet Muhammad’s personal use of cosmetics as recorded in Islamic traditions. The study critically examines the theological and anthropological consequences of these accounts for contemporary Islamic interpretations.1. IntroductionMany people today associate cosmetics — such aswanja(kohl), lip coloring, and skin lightening products — primarily with women. However, before forming assumptions about this, it is essential to trace the history of such beauty practices and when they began. Historical evidence indicates that these traditions originated centuries ago, particularly in ancient Arabian societies, with Egyptian women notably leading in the use of cosmetics for both beauty and cultural symbolism.This paper seeks to contextualize the use ofwanjain ancient Arabian traditions and critically analyze its significance, especially in light of recorded hadiths that report Prophet Muhammad’s personal use ofwanja. The question is raised: What meaning did such cosmetic application carry in the cultural context of Muhammad’s time, and what are the implications for contemporary Islamic thought?2. Historical Background of Wanja and Lip ColoringThe application ofwanjaand lip coloring was not merely for aesthetic purposes in ancient societies but carried significant cultural symbolism. For example, among African ethnic groups such as the Nyamwezi, Digo, and Bondei, a girl nearing puberty would traditionally be secluded, anointed with ashes, and later adorned withwanjaby elder women. This act signified her readiness for marriage and sexual maturity.Similarly, in ancient Arabian society, the application ofwanjaand red lip coloring conveyed explicit messages. A woman adorned in this way publicly signaled her sexual desire or readiness for marriage. The symbolism was deeply entrenched in communal customs, and such cosmetic choices were recognized as non-verbal cues within the cultural fabric.Prominent anthropologists and social scientists such as Deus Hans and Desmond Morris, in their nineteenth-century works, corroborated these interpretations. They noted that the reddening of a woman’s lips and the application ofwanjamirrored the physiological changes of the labia during sexual arousal. Consequently, these cosmetic practices had clear sexual connotations within traditional communities.3. Cosmetic Practices in the Time of MuhammadAlthough in modern times women apply cosmetics for various reasons, often unrelated to cultural signaling, in the era of Prophet Muhammad, such practices carried distinct meanings. A woman wearingwanjaor red lip color either signaled sexual availability or indicated her transition into marital eligibility following puberty.This context makes it important to interrogate Muhammad’s own reported cosmetic practices. According toSunan Ibn Majah, Hadith No. 309, it is recorded that:“Muhammad carried a mirror and a container of kohl (wanja) with him. He used a comb made from horn to groom his hair, applied oils, looked at himself in the mirror, and would applywanjato his eyes before sleeping. He also greatly loved perfumes.”This hadith, detailing Muhammad’s grooming routine, is significant given the cultural meanings attributed to these acts at the time.4. Theological and Anthropological ImplicationsGiven the Arabian cultural norms associated with cosmetic use, a pressing question arises: What was the Prophet Muhammad’s intention behind such practices? Within a society where applyingwanjaand lip coloring symbolized sexual desire or readiness for marriage, what did it signify when a man — and notably a religious leader — adorned himself in this way?This question demands careful theological reflection and honest anthropological inquiry. It presents a serious challenge for Islamic scholarship to reconcile prophetic practices with the prevailing cultural codes of the time, especially when those codes are laden with connotations that contradict Islamic modesty prescriptions in later jurisprudence.To dismiss this inquiry is to surrender intellectual integrity and reveal the limits of critical reasoning. Theological reasoning must not shy away from difficult questions but should confront them transparently.5. ConclusionThe history of cosmetics such aswanjaand lip coloring reveals their deep cultural significance in ancient Arabian society. When understood in this context, Prophet Muhammad’s reported use of these items raises important questions about his conformity to or divergence from societal norms laden with sexual and marital symbolism.This investigation calls for a nuanced, historically grounded, and theologically responsible engagement with early Islamic texts and cultural practices. Ignoring such matters or labeling them as irrelevant undermines intellectual honesty and religious integrity.A tragedy for Islam lies not in asking difficult questions but in refusing to answer them.Keywords:Muhammad and cosmetics, Arabian cultural traditions, wanja (kohl), Sunan Ibn Majah, Islamic anthropology, sexual symbolism, ancient beauty rituals, religious grooming practices.",

The study also reflects on contemporary moral, theological, and human rights implications of such traditions in both historical and modern contexts. Drawing on Islamic sources, Christian ethics, and universal moral reasoning, this paper poses serious questions to Islamic apologetics and encourages objective inquiry beyond inherited traditions.1. IntroductionThroughout history, religious narratives have shaped moral and social norms. However, not all traditions within sacred texts or religious histories align with contemporary ethical standards. This article examines narratives from early Islamic Hadith literature that describe the Prophet Muhammad’s marriage to A’isha when she was a minor and the consummation of this marriage at an age modern ethics would consider deeply problematic. It invites a theological and moral evaluation of these accounts and raises critical questions for contemporary Muslim believers and apologists.2. Historical Context: Child Marriage in AntiquityIt is acknowledged that child marriage existed in various ancient cultures. Tertullian, a Christian theologian writing between 200–240 AD, observed that even \"barbarians\" refrained from giving their daughters in marriage before the age of 12 and their sons before 14 (On the Veiling of Virgins, Chapter 11, p. 34). Despite such practices, the marriage of girls below puberty was not a universal norm, and caution against such unions existed even among pagan cultures.3. Child Marriage and Muhammad: Analysis of Hadith SourcesSeveral authentic Islamic Hadiths, especially those fromSahih al-Bukhari,Sahih Muslim, andSunan Abu Dawud, describe Muhammad’s marriage to A’isha and the consummation of that marriage when she was 9 years old.For example:Sunan Abu Dawud, Volume 3, Book 36, Chapter 1769 (Hadith 4913, p. 1379)records that A’isha would play with dolls, and at times Muhammad would enter while she played with her friends. The children would leave when he entered and return afterward, implying that intimate marital relations occurred during those visits.The marriage of young girls continues in certain Muslim communities today, often justified by citing Muhammad’s precedent.A shocking case is reported fromIvory Coast, where a 12-year-old girl was burned with a hot iron by her father, imprisoned for three days without food, and married off to a 40-year-old man—all justified by the claim of preserving cultural and religious traditions (Source:Sauti Ttokea Nyuma ya Mtando, pp. 136-137).According toSahih Muslim, even Imam Shafi’i expressed reservations about child marriages, suggesting that such unions were viewed critically by some early Muslims themselves (Sahih Muslim Reference 1958, p. 715; Translator’s Note 1960, p. 716).Additionally, historical narratives record that Layla’s relatives warned her about Muhammad’s reputation for excessive lust toward women, advising her to seek annulment of a proposed union with him. Layla agreed, and Muhammad accepted the annulment (Al-Tabari, Volume 9, p. 139).4. Ethical and Theological ReflectionsThese historical accounts raise serious ethical and theological concerns:Can a prophet of God engage in practices considered abusive or morally reprehensible by both ancient and modern standards?Is it appropriate for religious communities to continue justifying harmful practices under the guise of prophetic precedent?The Qur’an itself describes Allah as a \"master schemer\" (Surah 3:54)—a verse raising complex theological questions about divine moral nature in Islam.It is essential for sincere believers to critically examine inherited traditions, especially when they contradict universal human rights and the teachings of other religious traditions, such as Christianity, which upholds the dignity of children and opposes child exploitation.5. Critical Questions for Islamic ApologeticsThis study poses the following direct questions to Muslim apologists and believers:Is Muhammad morally superior to the so-called ‘barbarians’of his time, who refrained from marrying off girls under 12?When Muslims claim Muhammad was sinless, does this imply that all his actions—including child marriage—must be endorsed without moral scrutiny?Is there any act of sexual abuse or coercion one would be willing to condemn even if Muhammad allegedly practiced or permitted it?Why do many modern, especially Western-educated Muslims distance themselves from these Hadith traditions?What truths are they recognizing that traditionalists overlook?Why did Muhammad consummate a marriage with a child incapable of consent?Would any father today, Muslim or not, allow his 8- or 9-year-old daughter to be taken by Muhammad under the same circumstances?6. ConclusionIt is evident that certain Hadiths and traditions, even if historically authentic within Islamic historiography, promote harmful practices that contradict both ancient wisdom and modern ethics. It is the moral duty of every believer and honest scholar to question these narratives, reevaluate inherited doctrines, and seek alignment with universal principles of justice, human dignity, and child protection. The contrast between the moral example of Jesus Christ and these accounts of Muhammad is stark and invites a critical reassessment of religious loyalties and moral reasoning.Max Shimba Ministries Orgcalls upon all readers, Muslims and non-Muslims alike, to critically examine religious traditions, reject harmful cultural practices, and embrace ethical monotheism grounded in the teachings of Christ.BibliographySahih al-BukhariSahih MuslimSunan Abu DawudAl-Tabari,History of the Prophets and Kings, Volume 9Tertullian,On the Veiling of VirginsSauti Ttokea Nyuma ya MtandoThe Qur’an",

    "full_content": "The Qur’anic Rebuke of Muhammad: A Theological Reflection and InquiryBy:Max Shimba Ministries OrgAbstractThis paper explores surprising Qur’anic passages where Allah appears to rebuke, humiliate, or speak disparagingly toward Muhammad, the Prophet of Islam. While Muslim tradition venerates Muhammad as a sinless, elevated figure, the Qur’anic text contains verses in which Allah addresses him with stern language. This article juxtaposes these passages with Qur’anic descriptions of Jesus (Isa) — who is consistently spoken of in honorable terms — and compares this dynamic to the consistent dignity afforded to Jesus Christ within the Christian Scriptures. The reflection raises theological and doctrinal questions about Islamic eschatology, prophetic authority, and divine justice within the Qur’anic worldview.IntroductionMuhammad is deeply revered within Islamic tradition as the final prophet and the “Seal of the Prophets.” He is considered a figure of impeccable character and divine appointment. Yet, a critical reading of the Qur’an reveals passages where Allah issues direct reprimands, harsh statements, and even public humiliation of Muhammad. These verses challenge the popular perception of his spiritual status. More so, the Qur’an paradoxically addresses Jesus (Isa) in consistently honorable terms, raising further theological curiosity.This article examines these specific Qur’anic passages and raises essential questions:Why would Allah address his final messenger in such a disparaging manner?What do these passages imply about Muhammad’s spiritual standing?How do these interactions compare to the way God addresses Jesus in both the Qur’an and the Bible?What implications do these revelations hold for Muslim theology regarding heaven, hell, and prophetic authority?Textual Evidence and AnalysisA series of Qur’anic verses form the foundation for this inquiry:Mortality of Muhammad“Indeed, you (Muhammad) will die, and indeed, they too will die.”(Qur’an, Az-Zumar 39:30)And again:“Then on the Day of Resurrection you all will dispute before your Lord.”(Qur’an, Az-Zumar 39:31)Here, Allah bluntly declares the mortality of Muhammad, placing him on equal footing with his followers, which disrupts notions of prophetic transcendence.Muhammad as an Ordinary Man“Say: I am only a man like you…”(Qur’an, Al-Kahf 18:110)The Qur’an commands Muhammad to publicly identify himself as merely human, despite Islamic tradition that elevates him far beyond ordinariness.Muhammad's Sinfulness and Need for Forgiveness“So know that there is no deity except Allah and ask forgiveness for your sin and for the believing men and believing women.”(Qur’an, Muhammad 47:19)Nowhere does the Qur’an confirm Muhammad’s sins were forgiven — a troubling matter given his prophetic role.Inability to Guide Loved Ones“Indeed, you (Muhammad) do not guide whom you like, but Allah guides whom He wills.”(Qur’an, Al-Qasas 28:56)This passage portrays Muhammad as powerless in matters of salvation, contrary to the perception of a prophet interceding for his followers.Pointless Intercession for the Damned“Whether you (Muhammad) ask forgiveness for them seventy times — Allah will never forgive them.”(Qur’an, At-Tawbah 9:80)The verse renders Muhammad’s intercession ineffective, even repetitive and futile.Demand for Angels as Proof of Prophethood“And they say: O you upon whom the message has been sent down, indeed you are mad. Why do you not bring us the angels if you should be among the truthful?”(Qur’an, Al-Hijr 15:6-7)The absence of heavenly signs to support Muhammad’s claims undermines his credibility in the eyes of his opponents.Disparagement in Daily Life“And they say: What is this Messenger who eats food and walks in the markets? Why has an angel not been sent down to be a warner with him?”(Qur’an, Al-Furqan 25:7-8)The verse questions Muhammad’s prophetic legitimacy based on his mundane lifestyle.All Souls, Including Believers, Must Enter Hell“And there is none of you except he will come to it (Hell). This is upon your Lord an inevitability decreed.”(Qur’an, Maryam 19:71)And:“Then We will save those who feared Allah and leave the wrongdoers within it, on their knees.”(Qur’an, Maryam 19:72)This raises difficult soteriological questions about the fate of the righteous and whether paradise in Islamic theology is accessible without passing through Hell.Theological Questions and ReflectionsThese passages generate profound theological dilemmas:Who Are ‘We’ Who Will Save the God-Fearing?In Maryam 19:72, Allah refers to “We” saving the pious. Islamic theology traditionally asserts Allah alone saves. The plural raises questions about divine agency and authority.Why Must the Pious Enter Hell?The assertion that all — including believers — must experience Hell challenges conventional eschatological narratives of immediate paradise for the faithful. It suggests a grim universal judgment before redemption.Why Does Allah Rebuke His Own Messenger?It is troubling that Allah would publicly admonish and humiliate Muhammad, labeling him sinful, powerless, and ineffective. By contrast, Jesus in the Qur’an receives consistent honor and affirmation.In the Bible, God never speaks ill of Jesus Christ. On the contrary, He declares:“This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”(Matthew 3:17)The Qur’anic tone toward Muhammad stands in stark contrast to the biblical relationship between God and Christ, exposing a unique inconsistency in Islamic prophetic theology.ConclusionThis theological reflection challenges the Islamic portrayal of Muhammad’s spiritual perfection and unassailable authority. The Qur’anic text itself introduces narratives of rebuke, limitation, and humiliation that are absent from the divine treatment of Jesus both in the Qur’an and the Bible. It calls for a deeper inquiry into the authenticity of Muhammad’s prophetic claims, the nature of divine justice in Islam, and the ultimate fate of believers within Qur’anic eschatology.Max Shimba Ministries OrgKeywords:Qur’an, Muhammad, Jesus, rebuke, prophecy, Islamic theology, eschatology, divine justice, soteriology, prophetic authority, comparative religion.",

    "full_content": "The Status of Women in the Islamic Heaven (Jannah): A Theological CritiqueAbstract:This article examines the status of women in Islamic eschatology as portrayed in Islamic primary texts, including the Qur’an and Hadith, juxtaposed with Christian biblical teachings on women’s worth and their position in the afterlife. The paper questions the moral and theological implications of specific Qur’anic verses, Hadith narrations, and Islamic jurisprudence, particularly concerning women’s rights, female genital mutilation (FGM), legal punishments for adultery, and the depiction of paradise.IntroductionThe role and value of women within Islamic theology, both in this life and in the hereafter, has been a subject of ongoing debate and scrutiny. This article seeks to interrogate whether women truly have an equitable place in the Islamic paradise (Jannah) and examines Muhammad’s statements regarding women’s intellectual and spiritual status, as well as broader legalistic frameworks affecting Muslim women.Women in Islamic Teachings: A Review of TextsThe Prophet Muhammad, inSahih al-Bukhari, Book 2:541, is reported to have said:\"I have not seen anyone more deficient in intelligence and religion than women.\"Additionally, inSahih al-Bukhari, Book 7:33, Muhammad stated:\"I have not left behind me any affliction more harmful to men than women.\"Further,Sahih al-Bukhari, Book 7, Chapter 88:124, records Muhammad as saying:\"I stood at the gate of Hell and saw that the majority of its inhabitants were women.\"The Qur'an permits men to beat their wives inSurah An-Nisa 4:34. It also reduces women to objects of pleasure, likening them to fertile fields:*\"Your wives are a tilth for you, so go to your tilth as you will\" (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:223).In contrast, the Bible states:\"He who finds a wife finds a good thing and obtains favor from the Lord.\"(Proverbs 18:22)Additionally, Christian scriptures permit women to preach (1 Corinthians 11:1-5) and affirm Mary Magdalene as the first to witness and proclaim the risen Christ (John 20:16-18).Legal Punishments for Adultery: Whips or Stones?Although adultery in Islamic law was traditionally punished by stoning,Surah An-Nur 24:2prescribes one hundred lashes for both male and female adulterers, to be carried out in the presence of a community of believers. However, no distinction is made in this verse between married and unmarried offenders. This discrepancy arises because the practice of stoning is found not in the Qur’an, but in Hadith literature — notablySahih al-Bukhari, Book 8, No. 805.Notably, many modern Qur’anic translations place the phrase \"stoning to death\" within brackets inSurah An-Nur 24:2, indicating its absence from the original Arabic text. This raises a critical question: which law holds ultimate authority — that of Allah in the Qur'an or Muhammad's rulings in the Hadith?Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) in IslamThough globally condemned, female genital mutilation persists in many Islamic-majority countries. Muhammad’s position is preserved inSunan Abu Dawud, Book 41, Hadith 5251, where FGM is referred to as an honorable practice.Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal 5:75andAbu Dawud Adab 167similarly record approvals for female circumcision.In July 2014, the newly declared Islamic State of Iraq decreed that all women aged 11–46 undergo FGM, citing Islamic Sharia law. Notably, neither the Islamic State nor prominent Muslim clerics globally have officially refuted this mandate.Women in Islamic Paradise (Jannah)The Qur'an presents a sensual depiction of paradise, particularly tailored for men.Surah Al-Waqi’ah 56:10-40describes heavenly delights — wine, fruits, and specially created virgin companions. Yet, there is no explicit mention of what awaits Muslim women in Jannah.WhileSurah Az-Zukhruf 43:70states:\"Enter Paradise, you and your wives, in happiness,\"this raises a theological dilemma: What about Muslim women who remain unmarried in this life? Additionally, if Muslim men are promised heavenly companions of particular beauty and form, how will earthly couples remain united in the afterlife?A further paradox is posed bySurah Maryam 19:71-72, which declares that all people, including Muhammad and his followers, will pass through Hell before reaching Paradise. This adds tension to the portrayal of Islamic paradise as an immediate reward.Christian Conception of HeavenIn contrast, Christianity portrays heaven as a place for all believers — men and women alike.Matthew 22:30asserts that in the resurrection, people will neither marry nor be given in marriage. Instead, they will be like angels in heaven. Christ promises inJohn 14:1-3that believers will dwell with Him and the Father, and1 Thessalonians 4:17affirms that believers will eternally be with the Lord.Key Questions for Theological ReflectionWhy did Allah permit female genital mutilation (FGM) while globally it is denounced as a human rights violation?What is the true source of the punishment of stoning for adultery — the Qur’an or Muhammad’s Hadith?Does Muhammad’s Hadith override Allah’s commandments in the Qur’an?Why was the punishment of one hundred lashes, as stated inSurah An-Nur 24:2, seemingly abrogated by the practice of stoning?Will unmarried Muslim women in Jannah be given seventy-two male companions as Muslim men are promised female virgins?ConclusionThis inquiry invites both Muslim and non-Muslim scholars to critically evaluate these scriptural inconsistencies and theological injustices, particularly in matters concerning women. Where Islam’s paradise appears to promise sensual and gendered pleasures for men, Christianity affirms an eternal, spiritual union with God for all believers. It challenges the reader to question the moral foundation of eschatological rewards and urges individuals to seek Christ, in whom there is neither male nor female, but all are one (Galatians 3:28).Call to Reflection:Examine these matters diligently. Seek truth beyond tradition. Come to Jesus Christ.",

    "full_content": "By:Max Shimba Ministries OrgAbstractThis article investigates the identity of 'Allah' — whether He is the true God or a deceptive entity, often identified in Christian polemics as Satan. Through a historical-linguistic and theological analysis, the article explores how the term 'Allah' originated, its pre-Islamic pagan context, and its adoption into Islam. It emphasizes the importance of seeking verified religious truth over inherited beliefs and offers a reasoned Christian critique of the Islamic conception of God.IntroductionThere are two significant, widely misunderstood, and hotly contested perspectives regarding the question,“Who is Allah?”Around this issue, numerous unverified claims, deep-seated biases, and sometimes even baseless hostility circulate, which cloud objective discussion. While some people feel peace when they hear the nameAllah, believing He is the Creator God, others firmly maintain thatAllahis not God but rather Satan — the great deceiver, a false god. These conflicting sentiments evoke strong emotions in people’s hearts, which can obstruct our ability to objectively seek and recognize truth in this matter.This article invites readers to momentarily suspend their rigid positions and religious preconceptions, and instead ask themselves some crucial questions. Before evaluating evidence that might prove whetherAllahis the true God or not, I openly affirm the existence of the true Creator God of heaven and earth. However, it is essential to acknowledge how often we accept religious claims simply because they are passed down to us by others — through oral traditions, public sermons, or media broadcasts.While faith itself is not inherently harmful, it bears a considerable risk: that our goodwill and religious sincerity might be exploited by those with self-serving motives. Thus, it becomes vitally important to seek evidence and continuously test our beliefs, lest we discover too late that we’ve been misguided when it is no longer possible to amend our course.The Necessity of Verifying Religious ClaimsIn matters of faith, it is crucial to discern precisely what God commands — whether one identifies as a Muslim or a Christian. Each person must acquire firsthand understanding of God’s word so they can test everything presented to them in the name of divine authority. Otherwise, people of ill intent might preach false doctrines under the guise of God’s instructions, and sincere individuals might accept these teachings in good faith, mistakenly believing them to be divine.Muslims, for example, display commendable zeal in seeking and serving God. It is remarkable for a person to visit a house of worship five times a day, including at dawn when physical rest still beckons. Such dedication indicates a sincere intention to know and serve God.We have often heard of people sacrificing their lives for their faith. While I do not personally endorse such acts, putting aside the question of whether these deeds are right or wrong, one must admit that this level of devotion testifies to a genuine longing for God. The crucial question, however, is this:“Is this truly what God commands?”It seems almost unthinkable that a loving father with ten children would commend one of them for killing his siblings simply because he was ordered to do so. Or that such a father would declare,“Whoever kills his brothers will receive my love more abundantly.”Believing in the wrong thing — however sincerely — ultimately leads to disaster.The Etymology and Historical Origins of the Name 'Allah'The nameAllahoriginates fromal-Ilah. The prefixalfunctions much like the English definite article“the”, whileilahmeans“god”. Thus,al-Ilahtranslates to“the god”. Over time, linguistic evolution caused this compound to contract intoAllah. This kind of linguistic transformation is common. In Swahili, for example, one might hear someone say‘ndo ivo’, a shortened form of‘ndiyo hivyo’. It is conceivable that a century from now, people might not even realize the origin of‘ndo ivo’.Historically,Allahwas not originally the name of the monotheistic God of Abraham but was instead the title of a moon god in pre-Islamic Arabia. This moon deity had a wife believed to be the sun and daughters known asal-Lat,al-Uzza, andManat. These three goddesses were revered as high deities among the pantheon of gods worshipped by the Arabs before the advent of Islam — a period Muslims refer to asJahiliyyah(the age of ignorance).The termAllahwas masculine in form, which is evident since one of his daughters was calledal-Lat, a feminine variant. Just asFrancisis masculine andFranciscais feminine in European languages, so it was withAllahandal-Lat. Both names share the same root, differing only by gender.One of the communities that ardently worshippedAllahwas the Quraysh tribe, from which the Prophet Muhammad himself emerged.Was ‘Allah’ Known in Abrahamic Tradition Before Islam?There is a widespread misconception among many who assume thatAllahwas an unknown entity until Muhammad introduced him. Others claim thatAllahwas already known during Abraham’s time in the same sense as today. If that were true, one must then ask:How did the God of Abraham disappear, only for a pagan ‘Allah’ to emerge in his place?The historical evidence points clearly to the fact that theAllahof pre-Islamic Arabia was a pagan deity, one of many worshipped in a polytheistic society. Therefore, it cannot be logically consistent to conflate this paganAllahwith the monotheistic Creator of heaven and earth revealed in the Bible.ConclusionBased on this evidence — etymological, historical, and theological — I openly affirm thatAllahis not the true God of the Bible, but rather a pagan deity later appropriated into Islam. In Christian theological understanding, any entity that presents itself as God but is not the true God of Scripture operates under satanic deception. Hence, I conclude, with conviction, thatAllah, as presented in Islam, aligns more closely with the biblical concept of Satan than with the Holy God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.Max Shimba Ministries Org",

    "full_content": "Abstract:Throughout history, religious iconoclasm has been a powerful and often violent expression of theological absolutism. Among certain radical Islamic factions, the destruction of religious imagery associated with other traditions has been justified as a defense of monotheism and a rejection of idolatry. However, a closer examination of ritual practices within Islam—particularly those associated with the Kaaba in Mecca—reveals paradoxical elements that mirror the very behaviors these groups condemn. This paper critically explores the contradictions inherent in religious enforcement ideologies and practices, highlighting the sociological and theological implications of ritual object veneration within contemporary Islam.IntroductionReligious iconoclasm—the deliberate destruction of religious icons, statues, and sacred sites—has been a recurrent phenomenon across civilizations. In the modern era, certain radicalized Islamic movements have claimed exclusive authority to police the boundaries of monotheism through violent iconoclasm. From the demolition of ancient Buddhist statues in Afghanistan to the destruction of Christian crosses in parts of Europe and the vandalizing of Hindu and Shinto shrines in South and East Asia, these acts are publicly justified as a defense against idolatry (shirk). However, a critical investigation into the concept of idolatry within Islam and the ritualistic practices surrounding the Kaaba and the Black Stone (al-Ḥajar al-Aswad) reveals significant theological contradictions that merit closer scholarly scrutiny.Iconoclasm and Its Historical Rationale in Islamic ThoughtIslamic theology, especially in its early development, positioned itself against what it perceived as the polytheism and idolatry of pre-Islamic Arabia. The Prophet Muhammad’s reported cleansing of the Kaaba from its pre-Islamic idols is frequently cited as a foundational moment in Islamic monotheism (taḥwīd). Classical jurisprudence and theological texts have maintained a firm stance against any form of object-veneration that could potentially rival devotion to God. Yet, the distinction between reverence and idolatry has often been a subject of interpretative flexibility, allowing for ritualistic practices that, while officially monotheistic, bear striking resemblance to the customs condemned elsewhere.The Paradox of the Kaaba and Ritual Object VenerationCentral to Islamic worship is the Kaaba in Mecca, a cube-shaped structure believed by Muslims to have been constructed by Abraham and Ishmael. During daily prayers (ṣalāh), Muslims worldwide face the Kaaba, and the annual Hajj pilgrimage centers around ritual acts performed in its vicinity. Among these is the veneration of the Black Stone, which pilgrims traditionally attempt to kiss or touch. Additionally, the symbolic stoning of three pillars representing Satan, head-shaving, and circumambulation (ṭawāf) around the Kaaba during Hajj bear ritualistic similarities to practices in other religious traditions historically denounced by Islamic theologians.Comparative religious studies note parallels between these practices and the symbolic rituals of other faith systems, such as the Kumbh Mela pilgrimage in Hinduism, which involves mass bathing and ritual purification rites. Furthermore, the persistent emphasis on the physical Kaaba as the geographic and spiritual axis of the Muslim world introduces complexities into Islamic claims of aniconism and strict anti-idolatry, as it effectively sacralizes a particular object and location.The Irony of Religious Enforcement and Theological ExclusivismThe aggressive iconoclasm perpetrated by certain radical Islamist groups illustrates a theological inconsistency: while these groups denounce the veneration of religious images and objects in other faiths, they simultaneously participate in rituals that confer sacred status upon specific objects and spaces within their own tradition. This suggests that their iconoclasm is not purely driven by theological principle, but often by political and cultural motivations aimed at asserting religious dominance and cultural hegemony.The sacralization of the Kaaba and the Black Stone functions as a rebranded form of religious symbolism, maintained through ritual and theological justification rather than through consistent doctrinal application. As such, the claim of monotheistic purity becomes problematic when juxtaposed with ritual practices that exhibit clear parallels to the object-veneration behaviors they seek to eradicate elsewhere.ConclusionThe paradox inherent in Islamic iconoclasm, wherein idol-breakers become inadvertent idolaters, underscores the complexity of religious enforcement ideologies. The conflation of theological purity with cultural supremacy has led to selective interpretations of what constitutes idolatry, permitting ritual practices within Islam that mirror those condemned in other faiths. This reveals a profound irony at the heart of religious enforcement movements: while claiming to dismantle idolatry, they perpetuate it through alternative symbols, rituals, and sacred geographies.A nuanced, historically and theologically informed approach is necessary to unpack these contradictions and foster interfaith dialogue that acknowledges the shared human impulse towards sacred symbolism, rather than condemning it selectively. Future scholarship might benefit from comparative analyses between Islamic rituals and those of other traditions, illuminating the universal patterns of sacred object veneration beneath the rhetoric of religious exclusivity.Keywords:Iconoclasm, Islamic theology, Kaaba, Black Stone, idolatry, religious ritual, monotheism, Hajj, religious enforcement, religious symbolism",

It then explores this paradigm through the lens of Jesus’ parable of the wheat and tares in Matthew 13, assessing the implications for discerning authentic spiritual life from its destructive counterfeit. Finally, it offers a critical analysis of certain doctrinal and ethical aspects within Islamic theology and practice, arguing that its theological anthropology diverges fundamentally from the biblical vision of human dignity, compassion, and moral accountability.IntroductionThe concept of dual spiritual lineages emerges early in the biblical narrative. InGenesis 3:15, God proclaims enmity between the serpent and the woman, and between the serpent’s seed and her Seed. Theologians have long interpreted this as the foundation for a spiritual dichotomy within humanity: one lineage aligned with divine purpose and moral order, the other with rebellion and disorder (Hamilton, 1990; Sailhamer, 1996). This polarity is echoed in the teachings of Jesus Christ, particularly in the parable of the wheat and tares (Matthew 13:24–30, 36–43), where the world is depicted as a field containing both the children of the Kingdom and the children of the evil one.This article aims to examine how this biblical framework informs Christian theological anthropology and ethical expectations, and to evaluate critically the anthropological and ethical constructs within Islamic thought and praxis. The argument is made that while Christianity upholds a vision of humanity rooted in imago Dei, moral conscience, and redemptive potential, certain elements within Islamic jurisprudence and ritual practice betray a theological anthropology that is incompatible with these values, lacking both a coherent moral compass and a spiritually life-affirming ethic.Biblical Foundations: Two Lineages in Genesis and MatthewGenesis 3:15 serves as a pivotal theological text in the Judeo-Christian tradition, often regarded as theprotoevangelium, the first announcement of redemption (Wenham, 1987). The 'seed of the woman' and the 'seed of the serpent' symbolize two antithetical orientations of human existence: one towards God and righteousness, the other towards rebellion and destruction. This dichotomy recurs throughout Scripture—in narratives such as Cain and Abel (Genesis 4), the sons of God and daughters of men (Genesis 6), and ultimately in Jesus' teachings.InMatthew 13:24–30, Jesus elaborates on this division through the parable of the wheat and tares, illustrating how, within the same human field, two types of people coexist: those belonging to God and those aligned with evil. The eschatological resolution will separate the two, yet until then, discernment is necessary as appearances often deceive. This theme reinforces the biblical warning that not all who appear human bear the divine image in a redemptive sense (John 8:44).Anthropological and Ethical Critique of IslamWhen this biblical framework is applied to the comparative study of world religions, particularly Islam, significant anthropological and ethical divergences emerge. Islamic theology, while monotheistic, structures its anthropological vision and ethical system around jurisprudential legality rather than moral conscience shaped by divine love. Classical Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) has historically sanctioned practices such as child marriage, concubinage of war captives, and severe penalties for apostasy (Lewis, 2002; Ibn Rushd,Bidayat al-Mujtahid). These permissions stand in stark contrast to the biblical ethic, which grounds human dignity in the imago Dei and demands compassion and justice as reflections of divine character (Genesis 1:26–27; Micah 6:8).Furthermore, Islamic ritual practice, particularly the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, exemplifies a mechanistic religiosity devoid of the relational intimacy emphasized in biblical faith. The circumambulation of the Kaaba, a central rite, has been critiqued by scholars for its symbolic disconnect from a personal, covenantal relationship with God, reducing spirituality to ritual performance (Peters, 1994). While Christianity demands moral transformation through regeneration (John 3:3–6) and relational love (1 John 4:7–12), Islam frequently privileges external submission (Islamitself meaning ‘submission’) to divine command, often at the expense of inward ethical renewal.The Quranic portrayal of God asal-Mutakabbir(The Supreme) andal-Qahhar(The Subduer) frames divine-human interaction in terms of absolute authority and legal obligation, with limited space for grace-based, relational encounter (Nasr, 2003). This theological structure has, in various contexts, underpinned a religio-political culture where acts such as honor killings, forced conversions, and religiously sanctioned violence have found legal or social justification (Ali, 2015). Such practices reflect an anthropology that diminishes the intrinsic value of the individual and suppresses moral conscience in favor of juridical conformity.ConclusionThe biblical narrative posits a fundamental spiritual distinction within humanity: those who pursue God’s justice, mercy, and relational love, and those who align with chaos and moral nihilism. When applied to religious systems, this framework invites rigorous ethical and anthropological critique. While Islam shares superficial theological parallels with biblical monotheism, its juridicalism, depersonalized spirituality, and problematic moral allowances situate it within the lineage of structures that, in biblical terms, perpetuate spiritual death rather than life.This theological critique does not dismiss the dignity of individual Muslims, many of whom seek moral good within their cultural context. Rather, it underscores the necessity of evaluating religious systems not merely by their professions of faith but by the fruits they produce in human dignity, justice, and compassion (Matthew 7:16–20). In this, Christianity’s insistence on love, conscience, and imago Dei remains an unparalleled foundation for human flourishing.ReferencesAli, Ayaan Hirsi.Heretic: Why Islam Needs a Reformation Now.

While the Christian West ventured into transoceanic exploration, industrialization, and space travel, the Islamic world, dominated by the Ottoman Empire and other Muslim polities, often remained preoccupied with internal power dynamics and religious orthodoxy. The study explores key historical moments—from Columbus’ 1492 voyage to the 1969 Moon landing—and investigates the cultural, theological, and institutional factors contributing to the disparities in scientific and technological advancement between these civilizations. The paper argues for a nuanced understanding of civilizational progress, recognizing both periods of brilliance and stagnation within each tradition, and calls for a balanced historiographical approach in comparative civilizational studies.Keywords:Western Christendom, Islamic Civilization, Ottoman Empire, Scientific Innovation, Industrial Revolution, Space Exploration, Comparative History, Religion and Modernity, Technological AdvancementIntroductionThe historical interaction between Western Christendom and the Islamic world has shaped much of the modern global order. From military conquests and theological disputes to cultural exchanges and economic rivalries, these two great civilizations have profoundly influenced one another and the broader course of human history. However, the trajectories of their development, particularly regarding scientific innovation and technological progress, diverged markedly from the late 15th century onward.This paper seeks to trace that divergence through a comparative analysis of key historical milestones, examining how religious worldviews, political institutions, and socio-cultural priorities shaped the capacity of each civilization to embrace innovation and exploration. Rather than adopting a polemical stance, this study employs a historical-critical methodology to contextualize periods of civilizational ascendancy and decline within their appropriate socio-religious frameworks.1. 1492 and the Dawn of Global ExplorationThe year 1492 is a watershed moment in global history. As Christopher Columbus, under the commission of the Catholic Monarchs of Spain, embarked on his transatlantic voyage, the Christian West was undergoing the Renaissance—a period marked by rediscovery of classical knowledge and renewed emphasis on human agency and empirical inquiry. In contrast, the Islamic world, under the leadership of the Ottoman Empire, was consolidating its control over Southeastern Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa.While the Ottomans were a formidable military and cultural force, their focus remained largely inward, emphasizing religious orthodoxy, dynastic consolidation, and control of existing trade routes rather than maritime exploration. The comparative lack of Islamic participation in the Age of Exploration is indicative of differing civilizational priorities during this period.2. The Industrial Revolution and Technological ModernityBy the early 18th century, the Industrial Revolution began to reshape Western societies. The invention of the steam engine in 1712 by Thomas Newcomen—and later improved by James Watt—marked the beginning of mechanized industry and a new phase of economic and technological expansion. This period saw Christian Europe transform its societies through innovations in transportation, manufacturing, and communications.Conversely, many parts of the Islamic world struggled to adapt to these changes. The Ottoman Empire, beset by internal power struggles and administrative conservatism, resisted widespread industrialization. Theological constraints and the prioritization of religious orthodoxy over empirical inquiry contributed to a comparative stagnation in scientific development.3. The 20th Century: Flight, Space, and Modern CivilizationThe 20th century further amplified this divergence. In 1903, the Wright brothers—sons of a Christian minister—achieved the first powered human flight, marking the dawn of modern aviation. This event symbolized the culmination of centuries of scientific inquiry and mechanical innovation in the Christian West.By mid-century, the United States achieved another historic milestone with the Apollo 11 Moon landing in 1969, carrying both technological achievement and religious symbolism. While Western nations engaged in a space race emblematic of Cold War rivalries, much of the Islamic world grappled with post-colonial nation-building, political instability, and ongoing theological debates.4. Contemporary Reflections: Demographics, Religion, and InnovationIn the contemporary era, while Western nations explore Mars and harness advanced digital technologies, many Islamic-majority societies continue to navigate tensions between religious tradition and modernity. Islam’s rapid demographic growth has been frequently cited as a sign of global vitality; however, critics note the relative scarcity of globally recognized scientific and technological breakthroughs from these regions.It would be reductive, however, to attribute this solely to religious doctrine. A complex interplay of colonial legacies, geopolitical conflicts, and institutional constraints also accounts for these disparities. As such, both Western and Islamic civilizations have experienced alternating periods of intellectual brilliance and stagnation.ConclusionThis study underscores the necessity for balanced historical analysis in assessing the comparative development of civilizations. While the Christian West forged paths in scientific and technological innovation from the Age of Exploration to the Space Age, the Islamic world’s priorities often lay elsewhere, shaped by internal religious, political, and social imperatives.Recognizing these differences without resorting to cultural essentialism allows for a more nuanced understanding of how civilizations rise, flourish, and falter. Future studies should further explore how both religious and secular ideologies influence patterns of innovation and the complex ways in which historical memory shapes contemporary identity and progress.",

    "full_content": "A Comparative Analysis with Biblical EthicsBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThroughout history, religious texts have been subject to scrutiny, interpretation, and comparative analysis to assess their claims of divine origin and moral authority. One of the most debated issues in Islamic theology concerns the unique privileges granted to Muhammad in the Qur'an — privileges not extended to his followers, and which conspicuously coincide with moments of personal desire or scandal in his life. This paper offers a critical examination of these verses within the Qur’an, comparing them to Biblical narratives of patriarchal moral failure, and evaluating the theological implications for the concept of divine impartiality and holiness.Muhammad’s Exclusive Privileges in the Qur’anSeveral Qur'anic passages reveal peculiar concessions made specifically for Muhammad. A closer analysis of these texts suggests an unsettling pattern where divine revelations seem tailored to accommodate his personal interests, particularly in matters of marriage, sexual access, and household affairs.Surah 33:50provides Muhammad with an exclusive list of women he is permitted to marry or engage with sexually — including wives, cousins, slave girls, and any believing woman who offers herself to him. Notably, these allowances are restricted to the Prophet alone:“O Prophet, indeed We have made lawful to you your wives, those your right hand possesses… and a believing woman if she gives herself to the Prophet — if the Prophet wishes to marry her — [this is] only for you, excluding the [other] believers.”(Qur’an 33:50)InSurah 33:51, Allah grants Muhammad discretionary authority to favor certain wives and postpone others without consequence:“You may defer [the turn of] any of them you wish and take to yourself whomever you wish, and any that you desire of those whom you had set aside, there is no blame upon you.”Surah 66:1–2addresses an incident where Muhammad vowed to cease relations with his slave concubine, Maria the Copt, to appease his wives’ jealousy. Rather than uphold his word, a new revelation appears, rebuking him for forbidding what Allah made lawful:“O Prophet, why do you prohibit [yourself from] what Allah has made lawful for you, seeking to please your wives? And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.”Perhaps most controversially,Surah 33:37records Muhammad’s attraction to his adopted son Zayd’s wife, Zaynab bint Jahsh. Subsequently, a revelation arrives permitting the marriage:“And when Zayd had no longer any need for her, We married her to you so that there would not be upon the believers any discomfort concerning the wives of their adopted sons.”Even household etiquette is managed by divine decree.Surah 33:53advises guests not to linger in Muhammad’s home after meals to avoid infringing on his personal time:“When you are invited, enter; and when you have eaten, disperse without seeking to remain for conversation. Indeed, that was troubling the Prophet, and he is shy of [dismissing] you.”The consistent pattern suggests that revelations often served to resolve Muhammad's immediate domestic and personal predicaments, rather than addressing timeless, universal moral or theological concerns.Comparative Reflection: The Bible and Prophetic Moral FailureIn the Biblical tradition, figures such as Abraham, David, and Solomon indeed took multiple wives and concubines. However, unlike the Qur’an’s treatment of Muhammad, the Bible neither condones nor grants divine approval for these actions. Instead, the Hebrew Scriptures record such behaviors as moral failings with clear negative consequences:David’s adultery with Bathshebaand arranged murder of her husband resulted in severe judgment, including the death of their child (2 Samuel 12:9–14).Solomon’s polygamyand idolatry led to the division of the Israelite kingdom (1 Kings 11:1–13).The absence of divine endorsement for these acts underscores the Bible’s commitment to the principle that all humans, including prophets, are accountable to God’s moral law. Their failings serve as cautionary tales rather than precedents.Theological ImplicationsThe divergence between the Qur’an’s accommodation of Muhammad’s personal life and the Bible’s portrayal of prophetic fallibility raises significant theological questions. If a deity is truly holy, impartial, and transcendent, the expectation would be for moral consistency and justice — qualities compromised if divine revelation appears selectively self-serving. The Qur’an’s repeated intervention in Muhammad’s private affairs under the guise of revelation challenges the integrity of its claim to be a universal, immutable word of God.Moreover, the preferential treatment granted to Muhammad contradicts the Islamic assertion of his being a \"mercy to all worlds\" (Qur’an 21:107) and a model of moral perfection. If the sacred text reinforces inequitable privileges rather than holding its prophet accountable, it not only undermines its ethical credibility but invites the conclusion that the deity of the Qur’an functions more as a personal agent of the prophet’s will than as a sovereign, righteous God.ConclusionA careful, contextual, and comparative reading of the Qur’an alongside the Bible reveals marked differences in how prophetic misconduct is treated. The Biblical God remains morally consistent, rebuking even His chosen servants when they sin. In contrast, the Qur’anic Allah frequently appears as an enabler of Muhammad’s desires, issuing timely revelations that address his personal concerns, particularly in matters of marriage and social convenience.Such a pattern casts serious doubt upon the claim of divine impartiality in the Qur’anic message. It invites modern scholars and theologians to reevaluate the theological foundations of Islam, particularly where prophetic conduct and divine holiness intersect. It is the duty of any sincere seeker of truth to discern whether a religious system elevates human desire above moral law or upholds a transcendent, holy standard for all — prophets included.By Dr. Maxwell Shimba,Shimba Theological Institute",

    "full_content": "Isa Ibn Maryam as the Spirit of Allah: A Theological Examination from the Qur'anBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Servant of Jesus Christ, Our Great God (Titus 2:13)IntroductionThis paper seeks to examine a profound theological assertion based on Qur’anic testimony: thatIsa Ibn Maryam (Jesus, son of Mary)is not merely a prophet or messenger, but theSpirit of Allah— and since theSpirit of Allah is Allah Himself, Isa must therefore be divine. Drawing directly from the Qur’an, this study explores the unique relationship between Allah and Isa Ibn Maryam as expressed in the sacred Islamic text and presents an argument for Isa’s divinity within this context.The Nature of God and SpiritScripture affirms thatGod is Spirit(John 4:24), just as human beings possess a spirit, a soul, and dwell in a body. The intrinsic nature of spirit cannot be separated from its identity. A person’s spirit is fundamentally themselves — inseparable and essential. This theological principle applies universally: one cannot detach the essence of a being from its spirit.Qur'anic Testimony of Isa Ibn MaryamUpon examining the Qur’an, I discovered a consistent declaration that Isa Ibn Maryam uniquely shares in the Spirit of Allah in a way no other prophet or human being does. Consider the following verses:Al-Tahrim 66:12:“And Mary, daughter of Imran, who guarded her chastity, and We breathed into her of Our Spirit. She believed in the words of her Lord and His scriptures and was of the devoutly obedient.”Here, the Qur’an states that what entered Mary’s womb wasthe Spirit of Allah, not a created spirit butOur Spirit, referring to Allah’s own essence.Al-Nisa 4:171:“The Messiah, Isa son of Mary, was only a Messenger of Allah and His Word which He conveyed to Mary, and a Spirit from Him…”Notably, Isa is called boththe Word of Allahanda Spirit from Him, placing him in a unique ontological category distinct from any other prophet.Al-Anbiya 21:91:“And she who guarded her chastity, so We breathed into her of Our Spirit and made her and her son a sign for all peoples.”Again, Isa’s conception is directly linked tothe Spirit of Allah, not a created spirit or angel.Theological Reasoning: The Spirit of Allah Is AllahNo other human being — neither prophets, messengers, nor ordinary people — is ever described in the Qur’an asthe Spirit of Allah. This distinction reserved for Isa signifies a unique divine relationship. Simple reflective reasoning leads to a powerful conclusion:Is my spirit and I two different beings?No. My spirit is essentially myself.Is the Spirit of God not God Himself?Indeed, the Spirit of God is inseparable from His essence.Thus, ifthe Spirit of Allahentered Mary and became Isa, how can Isa not be Allah, since the Spirit of Allah is Allah Himself?If Allah affirms Isa to be“Our Spirit”, then Isa bears the divine essence and identity.ConclusionThe Qur'an, a book declared to be without doubt by Muslims (Al-Baqarah 2:2), explicitly teaches that Isa Ibn Maryam isthe Spirit of Allah. By following both the Qur’anic declarations and theological logic — thatthe Spirit of Allah is Allah Himself— one must conclude that Isa partakes in the divine nature.Such a conclusion aligns perfectly with Christian theology as revealed in Titus 2:13, where Jesus is called“our Great God and Savior.”Final ReflectionThis theological reflection invites both Muslim and Christian scholars to re-examine the identity of Isa Ibn Maryam within their respective scriptures. If the Qur’an indeed testifies that Isa isthe Spirit of Allah, and the Spirit of Allah is Allah Himself, then Isa’s divinity is affirmed, not merely within Christian doctrine but within the textual witness of the Qur’an itself.",

An Examination of Biblical and Historical EvidenceAuthor: Dr. Maxwell ShimbaInstitution: Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionMuslims frequently pose the question:Is the prophet mentioned in Deuteronomy 18:17–18, 33:1–2, and 34:10–11 referring to Muhammad or Jesus?This article endeavors to provide a clear, biblical, and historical response to this inquiry.Deuteronomy 18:15-18 and the Prophet Like MosesDeuteronomy 18:15-18 states that God would raise up a prophet like Moses from among the Israelites’ own brethren, and the people were commanded to listen to him. The primary considerations are:Was Jesus a prophet?Did most Jews hear Jesus?Was Jesus one of the Israelites?The biblical record affirms that Jesus was indeed a prophet (Luke 24:19), that He was heard by many (John 7:46; Matthew 7:28-29), and that He was a Jew from the tribe of Judah (Matthew 1:1-17; Hebrews 7:14). Historically, early Christian scholars affirmed that this prophecy more appropriately describes Jesus rather than Muhammad.Historical TestimonyAs a historical note, long before the Council of Nicaea (325 AD), Archelaus (262–278 AD) affirmed that Deuteronomy 18:15 could refer to no other person than Jesus Christ, as recorded inDisputation with Manes, chapter 43, p. 219.Further Considerations:a.Deuteronomy 33:1-2mentions “the Lord” coming with ten thousand of saints. Muslims do not call Muhammad their Lord. While some minor sects like the Alawites and other Ghulat sects have deified Muhammad, this is not mainstream Islamic belief.b.Deuteronomy 34:10records, “Since then, no prophet has risen in Israel like Moses.” This description, likely written by Joshua long before Jesus' advent, was still ultimately fulfilled in Jesus according to Christian testimony.c.Deuteronomy 34:10also emphasizes Moses’ unique communication with God “face to face.” Muhammad did not claim direct communication with God but rather via the angel Gabriel (Qur’an 2:97). In contrast, Jesus directly communicated with God the Father (John 1:18).d.Deuteronomy 34:11highlights Moses' mighty signs and wonders. Muhammad, according to the Qur’an (17:90–93), did not perform miracles of this magnitude, whereas Jesus performed numerous miraculous signs (John 20:30-31).e.Qur’anic ConfirmationQur’an 29:27 affirms that prophecy was bestowed through Isaac and Jacob, Abraham’s descendants. The Yusuf Ali translation states, “And We gave him Isaac and Jacob, and ordained among his progeny Prophethood and Revelation.” Interestingly, the Arabic text does not include the word \"Abraham,\" but Yusuf Ali inserted it for clarity. This implies that Muhammad, being a descendant of Ishmael and not Isaac, falls outside this prophetic lineage according to the Qur’an itself.f.Apostolic WitnessThe Apostle Peter declared in Acts 3:22–26 that this prophecy in Deuteronomy was fulfilled in Jesus. Either:Jesus erred by allowing Peter to mislead people for nearly 2,000 years without divine correction,Jesus deliberately appointed Peter, knowing he spoke truthfully,Or Peter never made such claims, and the book of Acts was corrupted before external textual evidence from as early as 138 AD could affirm the opposite.Patristic TestimonyEarly church fathers consistently identified Jesus as the fulfillment of Deuteronomy 18:15-18:Justin Martyr (114–165 AD),First ApologyIrenaeus (182–188 AD)Tertullian (c. 220 AD)Origen (225–254 AD)John Chrysostom (407 AD)Justin Martyr, writing between 138 and 165 AD, evidently engaged with this prophecy before composing his works.Textual Integrity of the New TestamentA Muslim might argue that Justin Martyr was mistaken, and all New Testament manuscripts misquoted Peter. However, early translations and manuscript traditions, independently transmitted across regions (Africa, Asia, Europe), consistently preserve Peter's declaration concerning Jesus in Acts 3:22–26.For Further Reading:Geisler, N.

From a Christian theological perspective, this narration appears to imply a deity whose mercy is actualized and perpetuated through the continued moral failure of His creation. It suggests a transactional dynamic where sin is, in some sense, necessary for the manifestation of divine forgiveness.Such a notion stands in sharp contrast with the biblical portrayal of God's holiness and human sanctification. In the New Testament, particularly in Romans 6:1–2, the Apostle Paul firmly addresses a similar issue:“What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?”Here, Paul repudiates any suggestion that sin should be tolerated or perpetuated for the purpose of magnifying divine grace. In Pauline theology, the redemptive work of Christ delivers believers from both the penalty and dominion of sin. Grace is not a license to persist in wrongdoing, but a transformative power that enables believers to live in righteousness.The Problem of Divine Mercy Dependent on SinFrom a classical theistic perspective, the idea that God wouldcreate people to sin so He might forgive thempresents serious theological difficulties. It implies a deity whose mercy is reactive rather than essential to His immutable nature. In Christian doctrine, God’s mercy is an inherent attribute of His being (Exodus 34:6-7), not contingent upon the moral failure of His creatures. The forgiveness extended through Christ’s atonement is a redemptive response to human sin, but it does not necessitate the continuous presence of sin to validate God's merciful character.Furthermore, classical Christian theology, as formulated by Augustine, Aquinas, and others, affirms that while God permits sin within the framework of human free will, He neither causes sin nor requires it to manifest His attributes. To suggest otherwise, as the hadith seems to do, would risk aligning the divine will with the perpetuation of moral evil — a notion that borders on theological fatalism.The Satanic Parallel: The Role of the TempterTheologically, one could argue that the logic of this hadith resembles the role traditionally ascribed to Satan in both biblical and Qur'anic narratives — namely, to entice humanity into sin. In Christian theology, Satan is depicted asthe tempter(Matthew 4:3), whose purpose is to alienate humanity from God through sin. The notion of a deity who would actively will the creation of sinners for the purpose of exercising forgiveness appears incompatible with the biblical depiction of a holy God who abhors sin (Habakkuk 1:13) and desires the sanctification of His people (1 Thessalonians 4:3).ConclusionIn summary, this hadith, when juxtaposed with the biblical testimony, reveals a fundamental theological divergence between Islamic and Christian conceptions of divine holiness, mercy, and the purpose of human moral agency. Where Christianity emphasizes deliverance from sin through the transformative power of grace, Islam, at least as represented in this narration, appears to accommodate a cyclical relationship between sin and forgiveness, potentially undermining the finality and efficacy of divine grace.From a Christian apologetic standpoint, such a portrayal might be interpreted as compromising the moral transcendence of God and inadvertently attributing to Him a role closer to that of the tempter — a role universally condemned in biblical theology. This distinction underscores the importance of a coherent and morally consistent doctrine of God in religious thought.",

    "full_content": "The Echoes of Baal and Molech in Islamic Theology: A Comparative Analysis of Child Death Traditions in Islam and Ancient Near Eastern ReligionBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaAbstractThis paper explores theological and ritualistic parallels between ancient Semitic deities—specifically Baal and Molech—and Islamic theology as preserved in early hadith literature. Particular focus is given to narrations concerning the death of children and their eschatological utility in Islam, drawing comparisons with the cultic child sacrifices historically offered to Baal and Molech for divine favor. This comparative analysis raises ethical and theological questions about the character of Allah within Islamic tradition and suggests a pattern of religious syncretism that merits careful scholarly scrutiny.1. IntroductionReligious belief systems often emerge within cultural environments steeped in myth, ritual, and inherited theological frameworks. Islam, though claiming to be a pure monotheistic revelation, arose in a seventh-century Arabian context saturated with diverse polytheistic traditions and vestiges of ancient Near Eastern religious practices. This paper investigates one unsettling theological parallel: the way the death of children is portrayed as spiritually advantageous in both Islamic eschatology and ancient Semitic fertility cults.2. Islamic Hadith on Child Death and ParadiseThe hadith collections of Islam contain numerous narrations where Muhammad addresses the fate of children who die before reaching puberty. Two notable examples include:Al-Adab Al-Mufrad 148“There is no woman among you who has three children die, resigning them to Allah, who will not enter the Garden.” A woman asked, “And if it is two?” He replied, “And if it is two.”(Source)Sunan an-Nasa’i 1873“There is no Muslim, three of whose children die before reaching puberty, but Allah will admit him to Paradise by virtue of His mercy towards them.”(Source)In these traditions, child death becomes a conduit for the parent's guaranteed admittance into Paradise, portraying death as a transactionally beneficial event rather than a tragedy to be lamented. This view introduces complex ethical and theological questions, particularly when juxtaposed with the explicit biblical prohibitions against child sacrifice and transactional suffering.3. The Cult of Baal and Molech: Historical ContextThe ancient Near East was rife with deities demanding human sacrifice, particularly of children.Baal, a Canaanite storm and fertility god, was often worshiped through rituals seeking rain and harvest, sometimes including the offering of children during times of drought or crisis.Molech(also spelled Moloch), a god of the Ammonites, is infamously associated with child immolation:“They built the high places of Baal in the Valley of Ben Hinnom to sacrifice their sons and daughters to Molech, though I never commanded—nor did it enter my mind—that they should do such a detestable thing.”—Jeremiah 32:35 (NIV)The practice involved offering children in fiery sacrifices to secure divine intervention or blessing. Scholars such as John Day (Molech: A God of Human Sacrifice in the Old Testament, 1989) have argued convincingly that this practice was widespread in the ancient Levant and directly condemned by Yahweh through the Hebrew prophets.4. Theological Parallels and Ethical ImplicationsWhile Islam categorically forbids literal human sacrifice, thetheological economyfound in these hadith—where a child’s death translates into spiritual profit for the parent—reflects atransactional relationship between human suffering and divine favorremarkably similar to the cultic patterns of Baal and Molech.The distinction is technical rather than conceptual: whereas Baal and Molech demanded the child's life as an offering, Allah is portrayed as rewarding the parent for the passive loss of the child. Yet in both frameworks, the death of the innocent becomes an instrument for achieving divine benefit.From a biblical-Christian ethical standpoint, this theological structure is profoundly problematic. The God of the Bible abhors child sacrifice (cf.Leviticus 18:21, 20:2–5) and portrays children as blessings to be cherished (cf.Psalm 127:3–5), not as instruments for transactional spiritual gain.5. Historical Syncretism and the Origins of AllahMultiple scholars have noted thatpre-Islamic Arabian religionfeatured a high god namedAllahworshiped alongside lesser deities (known as thedaughters of Allah: al-Lat, al-Uzza, and Manat). Arthur Jeffery, inThe Foreign Vocabulary of the Qur'an(1938), documented that many Quranic terms and concepts were borrowed from Syriac, Hebrew, and pre-Islamic Arab paganism.The Kaaba in Mecca, Islam's holiest site, housed360 idolsbefore being claimed by Muhammad. It functioned as a religious hub for various pagan Arab tribes — many of whom offered sacrifices (animal and occasionally human) to secure favor from their gods, including Allah. The transactional theology of death and divine favor in Islam thus appears as a theologicalresidue of pagan religious economy, refined within a monotheistic framework.6. ConclusionWhile Islam positions itself as a pure, uncorrupted monotheism, critical examination of its hadith traditions reveals theological structures eerily reminiscent of ancient pagan practices. The transactional view of child death as a means of securing Paradise bears disturbing parallels to the sacrificial economies of Baal and Molech.This theological overlap, coupled with historical evidence of syncretism in early Islam, suggests thatAllah's character in certain Islamic traditions reflects echoes of older Semitic deitiesrepurposed within a monotheistic framework. From a biblical and ethical standpoint, this raises significant challenges to the Islamic claim of theological continuity with the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.BibliographyArthur Jeffery,The Foreign Vocabulary of the Qur'an.

    "full_content": "The Theological Parallels Between Allah and the Ancient Deities Baal, Molech, and Satan: A Historical and Textual AnalysisThroughout history, religious belief systems have often evolved through the assimilation, reinterpretation, or repurposing of older mythologies and deities. It has long been suggested by Christian apologists and historians that certain theological and ritualistic aspects of Islam bear a striking resemblance to pre-Islamic pagan practices and to ancient Semitic deities such asBaal,Molech, and representations ofSatanin the biblical tradition. In this study, we will explore one such correlation: the handling of child death in Islam and its theological implications in comparison to the cultic practices of Baal and Molech.1. Islamic Traditions on the Death of ChildrenIslamic hadith literature contains several narrations concerning the fate of children who die young. Among these, the Prophet Muhammad is reported to have said:“There is no woman among you who has three children die, resigning them to Allah, who will not enter the Garden.”—Al-Adab Al-Mufrad 148(sunnah.com)Similarly, another hadith states:“There is no Muslim, three of whose children die before reaching puberty, but Allah will admit him to Paradise by virtue of His mercy towards them.”—Sunan an-Nasa’i 1873(sunnah.com)These traditions underscore a theological economy wherein the death of innocent children serves as a means of spiritual benefit for the bereaved, almost functioning transactionally: the child dies, and the parent is promised Paradise.2. Parallels to Ancient Baal and Molech WorshipIn the Hebrew Bible,BaalandMolechare depicted as Canaanite deities associated withchild sacrifice. The worship of Baal often involved fertility rituals, including child offerings in times of crisis to appease the god and secure blessings. Molech, specifically, was known for the gruesome practice of child immolation:“They built the high places of Baal in the Valley of Ben Hinnom to sacrifice their sons and daughters to Molech, though I never commanded—nor did it enter my mind—that they should do such a detestable thing.”—Jeremiah 32:35 (NIV)Both Baal and Molech demanded the lives of children under the premise of securing divine favor, blessing, or deliverance — a theological framework strikingly echoed in these Islamic hadiths where the death of children guarantees eternal reward.While Islam explicitly forbids human sacrifice, the underlying theological structure of associating the death of innocent children with divine reward appears hauntingly familiar to the transactional relationship ancient Near Eastern deities maintained with their worshipers.3. Theological Implications and Satanic ParallelsIn biblical theology,Satanis characterized as a destroyer, a deceiver, and the one who delights in the destruction of innocence (cf.John 8:44; Revelation 12:9–10). Any religious system that frames the death of innocent children as divinely beneficial raises profound ethical and theological concerns. From a Christian theological perspective, the god who benefits from or rewards human suffering — particularly the death of innocent children — reflects not the character of the God revealed in Christ, but one more akin to the adversarial nature of Satan himself.The Quran and hadith's positioning of Allah as one who promises Paradise in exchange for the deaths of children arguably aligns him more with the ancient images of Baal and Molech than with the benevolent, life-affirming God of the Bible. Notably, both Baal and Molech were regional deities of the pre-Islamic Arabian Peninsula and greater Levant, cultures with which early Islam was in continuous contact.4. Historical Syncretism and the Identity of AllahScholars such as Arthur Jeffery (The Foreign Vocabulary of the Qur'an, 1938) and others have argued thatAllahas worshiped by Muhammad was a transformation of a pre-Islamic moon deity of Mecca, linguistically and theologically intertwined with earlier Semitic deities. The semantic overlaps, cultic practices (including the pilgrimage to the Kaaba, which housed 360 idols before Islam), and transactional theology concerning death and divine favor point to asyncretic inheritancerather than a unique monotheistic revelation.ConclusionWhen viewed through a historical-theological lens, the depiction of Allah in certain hadith traditions—particularly those concerning the spiritual utility of child deaths—shares unsettling similarities with the cultic practices of Baal and Molech. Such parallels warrant rigorous comparative theological inquiry. The transactional view of child death in Islamic eschatology resonates far more with ancient Semitic paganism than with the compassionate, life-giving God of biblical Christianity.Thus, from a scholarly perspective, these hadiths serve not only as a window into the religious worldview of early Islam but also as a potential echo of older, darker religious traditions repackaged in monotheistic terminology.",

O you who believe! Send your Salat on him, and greet him with the Islamic way of greeting.”(Qur’an 33:56)Other translations, such as that of Qaribullah, render the phrase as:“Allah and His angels praise and venerate the Prophet. Believers, praise and venerate him.”This raises a profound theological question:what does it mean for Allah — the supreme, self-sufficient, transcendent deity of Islamic monotheism — to performsalat(prayer, blessings, or praise) upon a created being, namely Muhammad?1.The Lexical and Theological Tension: What is Salat?The Arabic wordsalat(صلاة) typically refers to prayer or ritual supplication. In Islamic theology,salatis the prescribed act of worship offered by human beings to God five times daily. However, when attributed to Allah Himself in this verse, it generates a semantic and theological challenge: ifsalatis understood as prayer or invocation, then upon whom does Allah pray? To whom does the Almighty direct His act ofsalat?Islamic exegetes such as Al-Tabari and Al-Qurtubi have grappled with this issue. Many have attempted to resolve the dilemma by redefiningsalatin this context assending blessings,mercy, orhonour. Yet, the consistency of the word’s usage elsewhere in the Qur’an — particularly when referring to acts performed by creatures toward God — leaves open the question of how it could signify something categorically different when ascribed to Allah.2.Does Allah Engage in Worship or Intercessory Acts?Ifsalatfundamentally denotes worship, praise, or supplication, then attributing it to Allah suggests a form of veneration or communicative act directed toward another. This poses a theological problem for Islamic tawhid (absolute monotheism), which asserts that Allah is utterly self-sufficient (Al-Samad, Qur’an 112:2) and dependent on no one.Thus, the critical question emerges:If Allah is offeringsalat, then to whom is this act directed?Is Allah engaging in an act akin to worship or intercession, and if so, to what or to whom?If the meaning ofsalatchanges contextually when attributed to Allah, does this not risk semantic equivocation within divine speech?3.The Elevation of Muhammad in Islamic DevotionThe same verse commands believers to likewise sendsalatupon Muhammad, effectively placing the Prophet in a unique position of continual veneration, both by the Creator and His creation. This has led some scholars, both Muslim and non-Muslim, to question whether this form of praise and exaltation of Muhammad blurs the strict Creator-creation distinction foundational to Islamic theology.It has also fueled polemical critiques from Christian and Jewish theologians throughout history, suggesting that Islamic practice risks elevating Muhammad to a quasi-divine status, effectively incorporating an intermediary figure between humanity and God, much like saints or demi-gods in other religious traditions.4.Conclusion: A Theological DilemmaThis verse, when read plainly, suggests that Allah performs an act —salat— toward Muhammad, alongside His angels, and then commands His followers to do the same. This raises unavoidable theological and philosophical questions:Does Allah, the utterly transcendent Being, engage in acts of praise or veneration?If so, to what higher reality is this act directed?Ifsalatmeans different things when performed by Allah versus when performed by His creatures, what grounds this difference linguistically and theologically?And does this continual exaltation of Muhammad suggest a mediating role that potentially conflicts with the strict monotheism claimed by Islamic doctrine?Such questions invite further critical reflection within Islamic theology, Qur’anic hermeneutics, and comparative religious studies. They also underscore the importance of precise definitions and consistency in attributing actions to the divine within any monotheistic framework.",

The Qur'an asserts:\"And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me.\"(Qur’an 51:56)While this passage establishes the intended purpose for both human and jinn existence, it leaves unanswered a critical question:On which day of creation were the jinn created?This is a fundamental theological issue that deserves close examination because it reveals significant gaps and ambiguities within Islamic cosmology — especially when compared to the detailed, orderly chronology of creation provided in the Bible.The Order of Creation in Islamic Tradition: A Missing ElementIslamic scripture, notably the Qur'an, mentions the creation of the heavens, the earth, and all that is in between insix days:\"Indeed, your Lord is Allah, who created the heavens and the earth in six days...\"(Qur'an 7:54)However, what is conspicuously absent in the Qur'an is a clear, sequential account of what was created on each of those six days — unlike the Genesis narrative in the Bible (Genesis 1:1–31), which meticulously records each day's creative acts.This leads to the following pressing question for Muslim scholars and apologists:On which specific day did Allah create the jinn?While hadith literature and tafsir (commentaries) offer varying opinions, none present a definitive, consistent, or universally accepted day within the six-day framework. Some Islamic scholars suggest the jinn were created before mankind, citing passages such as:\"And the jinn We created before from scorching fire.\"(Qur’an 15:27)Yet even here, the exact timing remains ambiguous. Was it on the first day, second day, or sometime before the six days of creation began? The Qur’an remains silent on this matter.The Biblical Contrast: A Clear ChronologyIn stark contrast, the Bible presents a coherent, day-by-day account of creation. Genesis 1 details the order of creation from light, the firmament, dry land, vegetation, celestial bodies, animals, and finally mankind on the sixth day. There is no mention of beings such as jinn, since such a category does not exist in Biblical theology — only angels and humans are recognized as sentient, moral beings.This contrast underscores a theological deficiency in the Qur'an’s creation narrative. While the Bible provides believers with a structured, understandable cosmology, the Qur'an leaves its adherents with unresolved ambiguities, raising questions about the consistency and completeness of its account.A Challenge to Muslim ScholarsTherefore, we respectfully challenge our Muslim counterparts:Provide us with a definitive, Qur'an-based account specifying on which day of the six-day creation Allah created the jinn.If the Qur'an is, as it claims, a clear and detailed book of guidance (Qur’an 16:89), why does it omit such a crucial element of its cosmology? Is it reasonable to believe in a text that establishes the purpose of a created being (worship) without establishing when that being came into existence within its cosmological framework?This theological inconsistency invites further scrutiny into the reliability of Islamic cosmology and raises broader questions about the internal coherence of Qur'anic revelation.Shalom,Dr. Maxwell ShimbaMax Shimba Ministries Org",

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaMax Shimba Ministries OrgAbstractThis paper critically examines the Qur’anic assertion in Surah 6:101 regarding the impossibility of God having a son without a consort and juxtaposes it against the Christian doctrine of the divine Sonship of Jesus Christ. The article interrogates the conceptual limitations within the Qur’anic anthropomorphic framing of divine procreation and contrasts it with the biblical understanding of the incarnation, where the miraculous birth of Jesus Christ from the Virgin Mary was an act of divine sovereignty unbound by human biological requirements. Through exegetical, theological, and philosophical inquiry, this work challenges the Islamic contention and offers a robust defense of the divinity and sonship of Jesus Christ within Christian thought.IntroductionThe identity and nature of God, and the concept of divine sonship, have been central points of divergence between Christianity and Islam. The Qur’an explicitly rejects the notion of God begetting a son, employing human analogies of procreation to argue against Christian claims of Jesus’ divine sonship. One of the clearest articulations of this is found in Surah 6:101:“[He is] the Originator of the heavens and the earth. How could He have a son when He does not have a companion and He created all things? And He is, of all things, Knowing.”This rhetorical question presupposes that for God (Allah) to have a son, He would need a female consort. This anthropomorphic limitation reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of the Christian doctrine of the eternal Sonship of Jesus Christ. This paper aims to unpack this Qur’anic presumption and contrast it with the theological reality of the incarnation and divine sonship in biblical theology.The Qur’anic Argument Against Divine SonshipIn several passages, the Qur’an vehemently denies that God can have a son (cf. Surah 4:171; 5:72-73; 19:88-92). The underlying argument in 6:101 is predicated on an anthropocentric understanding of begetting: that begetting necessitates a sexual partner, implying biological procreation.This anthropomorphism is problematic for several reasons:Conceptual Limitation:The Qur’anic assertion limits the capacity of divine action to human biological frameworks. It fails to account for the possibility that a sovereign, omnipotent God could bring forth a Son in a non-sexual, transcendent manner.Inconsistency with Islamic Belief in the Virgin Birth:The Qur’an affirms the virgin birth of Jesus (Surah 3:45-47; 19:16-21). In Surah 19:20, Mary asks,“How can I have a son when no man has touched me?”and is told that it is a decree from Allah. If God can cause a virgin to conceive without a man, then by the Qur’an’s own standards, it is possible for God to bring forth a Son without a consort.This presents a theological inconsistency: on the one hand, denying divine sonship on the grounds of no consort (6:101), while on the other affirming a miraculous birth without a male counterpart.Category Error:The Qur’an conflatesbegettingin the human, physical sense withgenerationin the eternal, metaphysical sense. Christian theology never teaches that God the Father begot Jesus through physical intercourse. Rather, it asserts theeternal generation of the Son— that the Son is eternally begotten of the Father, a relationship existing outside of time, space, and physical process.The Christian Doctrine of the Eternal Sonship of ChristIn Christian theology, the titleSon of Godis not indicative of biological descent but denotes the unique and eternal relationship between the Father and the Son within the Trinity. As articulated in the Nicene Creed (325 AD):“We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only Son of God, eternally begotten of the Father, Light from Light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, of one being with the Father.”This doctrine maintains:Eternal Generation:The Son’s origin is from the Father, but not in a temporal or physical sense.Consistent with Divine Nature:God is spirit (John 4:24) and does not procreate as humans do.Incarnation by Divine Fiat:The conception of Jesus in the womb of Mary was by the power of the Holy Spirit (Luke 1:35), not through physical union.Thus, the Christian claim is metaphysical and relational, not biological. The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit exist in an eternal relationship of mutual indwelling and love.The Problem of Qur’anic AnthropomorphismThe Qur’an frequently anthropomorphizes divine action to fit human paradigms — a practice that leads to theological inconsistencies:Creation without Means:Allah is described as creating by command,“Be, and it is”(Surah 3:47). If God can create ex nihilo (from nothing) by mere will, why impose human limitations regarding sonship?Virgin Birth of Jesus:If Mary can conceive Jesus without a husband by divine decree, it is illogical to deny God’s capacity to have a Son simply due to a lack of a consort.The Qur’anic reasoning in 6:101 thus exposes a theological inconsistency within Islamic thought: asserting divine omnipotence in some cases while denying it in others based on anthropocentric assumptions.A Philosophical Perspective on Divine SonshipFrom a philosophical standpoint, the Christian concept of divine sonship reflects a metaphysical relationship rather than a physical act. The notion ofeternal generationsignifies:Ontological Equality:The Son shares the same divine essence (homoousios) as the Father.Relational Distinction:The Father begets, the Son is begotten, and the Spirit proceeds — relationships within the Trinity reflecting roles, not inequality or temporality.Transcendent Causality:The begetting of the Son is an eternal act of divine self-revelation, unbounded by time, space, or material processes.ConclusionThe Qur’anic objection in Surah 6:101 against God having a Son without a consort reflects a misunderstanding of the Christian doctrine of the eternal Sonship of Christ. By imposing human biological categories upon divine action, the Qur’an inadvertently limits the omnipotence it elsewhere ascribes to God.Christian theology asserts that Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God, was not begotten through a consort but exists eternally in relation to the Father. His incarnation through the Virgin Mary was a miraculous act of divine will, consistent with the omnipotence and transcendence of God.The inconsistency within Islamic theology, affirming the virgin birth while denying the possibility of divine sonship on biological grounds, highlights the inadequacy of the Qur’anic critique. A proper understanding of divine nature necessitates moving beyond anthropomorphic limitations to grasp the metaphysical depth of the Christian claim: that in Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God entered human history for the salvation of mankind.ReferencesThe Qur’an, Surah 6:101; 3:45-47; 19:16-21.The Holy Bible, Luke 1:35; John 1:1-14; John 4:24.The Nicene Creed (325 AD).Anselm of Canterbury,Cur Deus Homo.Thomas Aquinas,Summa Theologiae, Part I, Question 33.Gerald O’Collins,Christology: A Biblical, Historical, and Systematic Study of Jesus.William Lane Craig,Reasonable Faith: Christian Truth and Apologetics.",

This apologetic strategy, often termedscientific apologetics, attempts to validate the divine origin of the Quran by aligning its verses with contemporary scientific understanding. However, upon closer inspection, these claims frequently fall short under historical, textual, and scientific scrutiny. In this segment, I will critically examine one such claim regarding geological knowledge in the Quran, compare it with antecedent biblical literature, and then briefly outline a framework for categorizing the Quran’s so-called scientific statements — many of which either reflect pre-existing beliefs, are misinterpreted, or are scientifically erroneous.The ‘Mountains as Pegs’ Claim in the QuranA frequently cited example of “miraculous science” in the Quran is found inSurah 78:6–7:\"Have We not made the earth as a wide expanse, and the mountains as pegs?\"(Surah An-Naba, 78:6–7)Muslim apologists assert that this verse reflects advanced geological knowledge, suggesting that mountains possess deep roots beneath the surface of the earth, thus stabilizing it — a notion compatible with the modern understanding of isostasy and tectonic plates. However, this interpretation demands scrutiny on several grounds.1. The Idea Was Not Unique to the QuranThe concept of mountains having roots was neither novel nor miraculous at the time of the Quran’s compilation. The Hebrew Bible, written centuries before Muhammad, contains similar imagery. Consider the following examples:Job 28:9 (NIV):“People assault the flinty rock with their hands and lay bare the roots of the mountains.”Jonah 2:6 (NIV):“To the roots of the mountains I sank down; the earth beneath barred me in forever.”In these passages, the metaphorical concept of mountains having roots was already well-established within the biblical tradition. These references predate the Quran by over a millennium and suggest that such imagery was part of the wider ancient Near Eastern cosmology rather than an instance of divine revelation unique to Muhammad.2. The Misapplication of Modern GeologyWhile modern geology indeed confirms that mountain ranges have subterranean roots, this should not be retroactively read into ancient texts unless those texts explicitly articulate such a concept in scientific terms. The Quran’s use ofpegs (awtād)is metaphorical, in line with prevailing ancient worldviews where mountains were imagined as stakes or tent pegs holding down the earth’s flat expanse — a cosmological motif common in pre-Islamic Arab poetry and folklore.Moreover, early tafsir (commentaries) by Muslim scholars such asIbn KathirandAl-Tabariinterpreted these verses metaphorically as well, seeing mountains as stabilizing features but not offering scientific explanations akin to plate tectonics or geological isostasy.Categories of Alleged Scientific Knowledge in the QuranWhen reviewing the full corpus of alleged scientific miracles in the Quran, we find that these claims fall into three distinct categories:Category 1: Verses Misinterpreted to Align with Modern ScienceMany Quranic verses are made to say things they do not explicitly state through forced or selective interpretation. A well-known example is the claim that the Quran describes theBig BanginSurah 21:30:“Do not those who disbelieve see that the heavens and the earth were joined together, then We split them apart?”Islamic apologists interpret this as a description of the Big Bang, despite the text’s original intent likely referring to the separation of the earth and heavens in the ancient Near Eastern cosmology of a flat earth covered by a solid firmament.Category 2: Knowledge Widely Known Prior to the QuranNumerous scientific facts attributed to the Quran were already well known in surrounding cultures and civilizations before the 7th century CE. For instance, notions aboutembryology, which Muslims often cite as a Quranic miracle, can be traced to earlier Greek medical authorities such asHippocrates(c. 460–370 BCE) andGalen(c. 129–210 CE). The embryological sequence mentioned inSurah 23:12–14mirrors concepts in Galenic medicine more closely than any revelation from an omniscient source.Category 3: Scientifically Erroneous StatementsA number of Quranic verses make claims that are flatly contradicted by modern scientific knowledge. Among these:Surah 18:86claims the sun sets in a muddy spring:“Until, when he reached the setting of the sun, he found it setting in a spring of black muddy water...”Scientifically, the sun neither sets in any earthly body of water nor is the sun’s setting a local event.Surah 67:5equates stars with meteorites:“And We have certainly beautified the nearest heaven with lamps (stars) and have made from them what is thrown at the devils...”This suggests that stars (billions of light years away) serve as projectiles against devils, a notion incompatible with contemporary astrophysics.Surah 86:7locates the origin of semen “between the backbone and the ribs”:“Emitted from between the backbone and the ribs.”Human semen is produced in the testes, which anatomically reside in the scrotum, and not between the spine and ribs. Even accounting for poetic language, this description misrepresents human reproductive anatomy.ConclusionUpon careful textual, historical, and scientific analysis, the claim that the Quran contains miraculous scientific knowledge does not withstand academic scrutiny. Not only do purported scientific verses either reflect ideas already present in earlier biblical or Greco-Roman texts, but many are also forced reinterpretations or scientifically erroneous. As such, these apologetic arguments fail to provide compelling evidence for the Quran’s divine origin.A genuinely divine text would be expected to transcend the limitations of its historical and cultural milieu, offering knowledge demonstrably inaccessible to its contemporaries. The Quran, by contrast, mirrors the cosmology, anthropology, and embryology of the 7th-century Arabian world — a clear indication of its human authorship.The conversation about science and scripture must remain honest, historically grounded, and free from anachronistic projections of modern knowledge onto ancient texts. In light of these observations, the assertion that the Quran contains scientifically miraculous knowledge remains unsupported.Dr. Maxwell ShimbaFounder & Director, Shimba Theological InstituteOrlando, Florida",

    "full_content": "There Is No Scientific Knowledge in the Quran – Part Two: A Critical Examination of Embryology in Surah 23:12–14By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractClaims regarding miraculous scientific foreknowledge in the Quran have long been propagated by Islamic apologists, with embryology often presented as a key example. This paper critically evaluates the embryological claims in Surah 23:12–14, contextualizing them within the framework of ancient Greek embryological knowledge and comparing them with established modern scientific evidence. The study demonstrates that not only are the Quranic descriptions of embryological development derivative of pre-Islamic sources such as Aristotle and Galen, but they also contain scientifically inaccurate statements inconsistent with contemporary embryological understanding.IntroductionIn modern Islamic apologetics, much has been made of the assertion that the Quran contains prescient scientific facts unknown in the 7th century CE, which allegedly confirm its divine origin. Among the most frequently cited examples is its supposed description of human embryological development in Surah 23:12–14. Muslim scholars and popular preachers assert that the Quran’s account mirrors modern embryology in remarkable detail. However, a careful examination of both the historical and scientific context reveals that these claims are unfounded.This paper seeks to situate the Quranic text within the historical continuum of ancient embryological theories and juxtapose its content against current embryological knowledge, thereby dispelling the notion of its miraculous scientific accuracy.Textual Analysis of Surah 23:12–14The passage in question reads:“And indeed We created man from an essence of clay; then We placed him as a drop in a secure lodging; then We made the drop into a hanging thing (alaqah), then We made the hanging thing into a chewed lump (mudghah), then We made out of the chewed lump bones, then We clothed the bones with flesh, then We developed it into another creation. So blessed be Allah, the best of creators.”(Quran 23:12–14)Proponents of Quranic scientific miracles typically focus on two key features:The assertion of development instages.The depiction of the embryo attaching to the uterus (a safe lodging).However, as this analysis will demonstrate, these concepts were neither novel in the 7th century nor scientifically precise by contemporary standards.Historical Context: Embryological Knowledge Before IslamAristotle (384–322 BCE)InOn the Generation of Animals, Aristotle presents a systematic explanation of embryological development. He identified sequential stages of formation and growth, observing that certain organs and structures arise before others. In Book IV, 734a, Aristotle describes how the heart forms first, followed by other vital organs and tissues. He also noted the importance of a safe environment within the mother’s womb for the developing embryo.Aristotle’s observations, though not fully accurate by modern standards, demonstrate an advanced awareness of staged development and uterine attachment, concepts widely circulated in Greco-Roman medicine centuries before the Quran.Galen (129–c. 200 CE)Perhaps more directly influential was the Greek physician Galen, whose treatiseOn the Natural FacultiesandOn the Formation of the Fetusdetail human development stages. Galen described the embryo as initially a formless substance, subsequently developing into a form resembling a chewed lump and later solidifying into bones. Crucially, Galen maintained that bones form first and are then “clothed” in flesh — an idea echoed verbatim in the Quranic text.Given the transmission of Greco-Roman medical texts through Syriac and Persian intermediaries, it is historically plausible that Muhammad or his contemporaries encountered Galenic embryology either directly or indirectly through oral tradition.Scientific Inaccuracies in the Quranic AccountModern embryology, based on centuries of anatomical and genetic research, has demonstrated that:Themesoderm— a primary germ layer — gives rise to both bone and muscle tissues simultaneously, not sequentially as suggested in the Quran.Bones do not initially form and then acquire flesh. Instead,cartilaginous modelsof bones and muscle masses develop in parallel during embryogenesis, with ossification (bone hardening) occurring later.Moreover, the termmudghah(chewed lump) is anatomically imprecise and does not reflect any scientifically identifiable stage of human embryonic development. While it might subjectively resemble the visual appearance of somite segmentation, this is an imprecise and primitive description, inconsistent with modern embryological classification.The Quranic account's reliance on visually and texturally based analogies (hanging thing, chewed lump, clothed bones) reflects observational limitations of pre-scientific cultures rather than inspired or miraculous knowledge.Derivation, Not Revelation: The Greek Medical Legacy in the QuranThe linguistic and conceptual parallels between Galen’s embryological model and the Quranic text have led several historians of medicine to conclude that the Quran’s account was derived from pre-existing medical traditions. Scholars such as Edward Gibbon and W. Montgomery Watt note the extensive cross-cultural interactions between Arabian, Persian, and Byzantine societies, particularly through the translation movements in the pre-Islamic Near East.It is historically implausible to assert that Muhammad, operating within a milieu already influenced by Hellenistic medicine, could produce a unique or divinely inspired account of embryology when the same concepts — including the sequential formation of bones and flesh — appear in Galenic writings composed centuries earlier.ConclusionThe claim that the Quran contains miraculous scientific knowledge regarding embryology is not substantiated upon critical examination. The description in Surah 23:12–14 reflects the rudimentary and derivative understanding of human development available in Greco-Roman antiquity. Far from being divinely revealed insights into biological science, the Quranic embryological narrative appears to be a rearticulation of ideas previously established by figures such as Aristotle and Galen.Additionally, the Quranic sequence of embryonic development is scientifically inaccurate, particularly in its assertion that bones form before flesh. Modern embryology, grounded in detailed anatomical observation and molecular biology, has decisively demonstrated that musculoskeletal structures develop concurrently from the mesoderm.Consequently, the embryological descriptions in the Quran do not offer evidence of miraculous foreknowledge but rather reveal the limitations of 7th-century Arabian knowledge and its dependence on earlier Hellenistic medical traditions.ReferencesAristotle.On the Generation of Animals, Book IV.Galen.On the Natural Faculties, trans.

A Critical Examination of the Islamic Claim of Muhammad’s Illiteracy and Its Use as Evidence for the Divine Origin of the Qur’anDr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteAbstractMany Muslims argue that the Prophet Muhammad’s alleged illiteracy serves as proof that the Qur’an must be divinely inspired, claiming that it would be impossible for an illiterate man to produce a text of such literary and rhetorical sophistication. However, both internal Islamic sources and linguistic evidence raise significant questions about whether Muhammad was truly illiterate. This paper critically examines the Islamic claim of Muhammad’s illiteracy, the meaning of the Arabic termummiyun, and considers historical hadith evidence that suggests Muhammad may have possessed reading and writing skills. Ultimately, this study argues that Muhammad’s literacy or illiteracy is irrelevant to claims of divine authorship, as the Qur’an was compiled in written form only after his death.IntroductionThe claim of Muhammad’s illiteracy is one of the traditional apologetic positions used by Muslim scholars to affirm the miraculous nature of the Qur’an. The popular reasoning posits:how could an unlettered man produce a literary masterpiece such as the Qur’an unless aided by divine revelation?(Nasr, 2003). This belief is largely built upon the interpretation of certain Qur’anic verses and early Islamic traditions. However, closer examination of primary sources and linguistic evidence problematizes this assertion.The Qur’an’s Compilation and the Irrelevance of Muhammad’s LiteracyIt is universally acknowledged within Islamic historiography that the Qur’an was revealed orally to Muhammad and memorized by his followers before it was compiled into a written codex after his death during the caliphate of Abu Bakr and completed under Uthman (al-Bukhari, Hadith 4986). Therefore, whether Muhammad was literate has no direct bearing on the production of the Qur’anic text. As Denny (2006) observes, \"The Qur'an itself was a product of oral tradition long before it became a book.\"Thus, even if Muhammad had been illiterate, it would not automatically prove divine authorship of the Qur'an, as the text's preservation and composition were human activities undertaken by literate companions.The Linguistic Ambiguity of the TermUmmiyunOne of the primary textual bases for the claim of Muhammad’s illiteracy is found inSurah 7:157, where Muhammad is referred to asal-nabiyy al-ummiy(ٱلنَّبِىَّ ٱلْأُمِّىَّ). Traditionally,ummiyis translated asunletteredorilliterate. However, authoritative lexicographical works, such as Edward Lane’sArabic-English Lexicon, reveal thatummiyalso meansgentile, or one not belonging to the People of the Book (Lane, 1863, p. 92).This understanding is contextually supported bySurah 62:2, which speaks of Muhammad being sent to theummiyun(ٱلْأُمِّيِّينَ), conventionally rendered asthe unlettered, but which can reasonably be read asthe gentiles, contrasting them with Jews and Christians. Watt (1953) notes that in pre-Islamic usage,ummiyunoften denoted those outside the Judeo-Christian scriptural tradition.Therefore, the evidence does not conclusively affirm that Muhammad was illiterate, but rather may simply identify him as a non-Jewish, non-Christian Arab.Hadith Evidence Suggesting Muhammad’s LiteracyIn addition to linguistic analysis, several authentic hadith reports imply Muhammad possessed at least basic literacy:The Treaty of Hudaybiyyah (Sahih al-Bukhari 2699)When negotiating with the Meccans, Muhammad is reported to have taken a treaty document and altered its text himself after a dispute about his prophetic title. The hadith records:\"Allah’s Messenger took the document and wrote: 'This is what Muhammad bin Abdullah has agreed upon…'\"(al-Bukhari, 2699).If accurate, this account directly contradicts the claim that Muhammad was incapable of writing.The Event of the Pen and Paper Before His Death (Sahih al-Bukhari 114; Sahih Muslim 1637a)Before his death, Muhammad reportedly asked for writing materials to write a statement to prevent the community from going astray:\"Bring me paper so that I may write for you a statement after which you will never go astray.\"(al-Bukhari, 114).The wording here implies his capacity to write, undermining claims of complete illiteracy.ConclusionThe claim of Muhammad’s illiteracy as a miraculous proof for the divine origin of the Qur’an is both theologically and historically problematic. First, Muhammad’s literacy status is irrelevant since the Qur’an was compiled as a written book only after his death. Second, linguistic evidence reveals thatummiyunmore appropriately refers to a gentile, not necessarily an illiterate person. Third, credible hadith traditions suggest Muhammad was at least capable of reading and writing.Therefore, the argument from illiteracy is neither a reliable proof of the Qur'an’s divine origin nor a historically uncontested fact. Rather, it is a theological assertion unsupported by conclusive textual or historical evidence.Referencesal-Bukhari, M. I. (n.d.).Sahih al-Bukhari. Hadith No. 114, 2699, 4986.Denny, F. M.

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractMuslim apologists often claim the Qur'an is a flawless, divinely authored scripture without contradictions, inconsistencies, or discrepancies. This assertion is rooted in Surah 4:82 and reiterated by classical Islamic scholars such as Ibn Kathir and contemporary translators like Yusuf Ali. However, a closer critical textual analysis reveals internal inconsistencies within the Qur'an’s narrative framework. This study focuses on one category of such contradictions: the identity of the 'first Muslim' according to different passages, which reveals a significant inconsistency within the text.1. IntroductionThe Qur'an, revered by Muslims as the final, unaltered word of God, explicitly claims to be free from contradiction. Surah 4:82 states:\"Do they not consider the Qur'an (with care)? Had it been from other than Allah, they would surely have found therein much discrepancy.\"(Surah 4:82, Yusuf Ali Translation)Classical exegeteIbn Kathirasserts that this verse establishes the Qur'an’s divine origin, claiming it contains no inconsistencies, conflicting statements, or discrepancies because it is a revelation from theMost-Wise, Most-Praised. Similarly,Yusuf Aliin his commentary emphasizes the Qur’an’s claim of textual coherence as a testament to its divine authorship.This study examines this claim by evaluating a notable contradiction within the Qur'an: the conflicting identification of who was the first Muslim.2. The Claim of Consistency in the Qur'anBoth classical and modern Islamic scholars affirm the Qur'an's consistency based on Surah 4:82. Yusuf Ali states:“The Qur'an claims to be a revelation from Allah, and the challenge is that if it were from any other source, it would contain many inconsistencies and contradictions, which no one can deny exist in any human composition. But in the Qur'an, no such inconsistencies exist. It is the perfect and coherent Book of Allah, remaining free from any contradiction, regardless of how many years it was revealed or the diverse subjects it covers.”This view represents the majority position in classical Islamic thought.3. Contradictory Claims About the First MuslimDespite the claims of consistency, a careful reading of the Qur'an reveals conflicting statements regarding who was thefirst Muslim. Several verses appear to assign this title to different figures:MuhammadSurah 39:12“And I (Muhammad) am commanded to be the first of those who submit (as Muslims).”Surah 6:163“No partner has He; this am I commanded, and I am the first of those who submit.”MosesSurah 7:143“When Moses came at the appointed time and place, and his Lord spoke to him, he said, ‘O my Lord, show Yourself to me, so I may look at You.’ … when he recovered, he said: ‘Glory be to You! I turn to You in repentance, and I am the first to believe.’”AbrahamSurah 2:132“And this was the legacy that Abraham left to his sons, and so did Jacob; ‘O my sons! Allah has chosen the Faith for you; so do not die except in the Faith of Islam.’”Each verse proclaims the subject as the 'first Muslim' or the first to submit to God’s will in Islam. This creates a theological and textual contradiction, as it is logically impossible for multiple, historically sequential figures to each bethe firstMuslim.4. Analysis of the ContradictionThis inconsistency raises critical questions about the claim made inSurah 4:82. If the Qur'an is entirely free from discrepancy, how can it declare multiple individuals, separated by centuries in Islamic tradition, as the ‘first’ Muslim?One may attempt to harmonize these verses by suggesting the phrase ‘first Muslim’ is metaphorical, contextual, or refers to a particular community or event. However, the straightforward reading in each passage indicates a definitive and literal first claim, making such reconciliations appear forced and exegetically weak.Moreover, the Qur’an portrays Islam not as a religion founded by Muhammad, but as the primordial faith of submission to God (as practiced by Abraham, Moses, and others). While this theological perspective could allow for contextual uses of 'first Muslim' in specific situations, the verses lack the necessary qualifiers, leading to an unavoidable tension within the text.5. Implications for the Qur’an’s Claim of ConsistencyIf, according toSurah 4:82, the presence of discrepancies would disqualify the Qur'an’s divine authorship, then these conflicting declarations undermine the very standard it sets for itself. As the Qur’an itself provides multiple claimants for the title offirst Muslim, it contradicts its claim of perfect internal consistency.This issue is not merely a matter of hermeneutics but strikes at the heart of the Qur'an’s self-authenticating claim of inerrancy.6. ConclusionThis analysis demonstrates that, contrary to the Qur'an’s claim inSurah 4:82and the assertions of classical and modern Islamic scholarship, internal contradictions do exist within the text. The case of multiple figures being designated as thefirst Muslimillustrates a clear textual inconsistency.As such, the Qur'an’s claim to be entirely free of contradiction must be reconsidered in light of these findings. This study represents the first installment in a broader critical examination of Qur'anic consistency, which will continue in subsequent analyses.Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

    "full_content": "Muhammad and Satanic Influence in Islamic Texts: A Critical ExaminationDr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis paper critically examines key Islamic primary sources and early biographical materials that suggest episodes of satanic influence upon Muhammad, the prophet of Islam. By analyzing authenticated hadith collections, classical biographies, and relevant Qur'anic verses, this study investigates claims of satanic intervention in the prophetic experiences of Muhammad, contrasting these accounts with Biblical theology. The study also draws theological parallels between the character of Allah in the Qur'an and the Biblical description of Satan, providing a foundation for further interfaith apologetic dialogue.A. The Nature of Muhammad’s Revelations1. Divine Inspiration as a Ringing BellInSahih Al-Bukhari(Vol. 4, Book 54, Hadith no. 438), Aisha narrates how Muhammad described the mechanism of divine inspiration. He confessed that sometimes it resembled the sound of a ringing bell — a description of supernatural communication that finds no parallel in Biblical prophetic tradition:“The Angel sometimes comes to me with a voice which resembles the sound of a ringing bell, and when this state abandons me, I remember what the Angel has said, and this type of Divine Inspiration is the hardest on me…”This peculiar phenomenon warrants scrutiny, particularly in light of Muhammad’s own aversion to bells elsewhere in Islamic tradition.B. Bells and Satanic AssociationsInSunan Abu Dawud(Book 34, Hadith no. 4218), Muhammad explicitly condemns the use of bells, claiming:“Women cannot wear bells on their legs. There is a devil along with each bell.”The contradiction between the medium of Muhammad’s claimed revelation and his own assertion of bells’ satanic association raises a critical theological dilemma.C. Satanic Revelation in Early Islam1. Satan as the Source of RevelationAccording toUmdah al-Ahkam(Vol. 3, Hadith no. 460), a disturbing tradition suggests:“Allah was Satan in the form of an angel that revealed to me the verses and his book the Quran and I am his prophet.”Though this narration is contested in isnād authenticity by many Muslim scholars, its very circulation within early Islamic discourse reveals theological anxieties about the source of Muhammad’s revelations.2. The Incident of the Satanic VersesThe most infamous episode appears inThe Life of Muhammadby Ibn Ishaq (pp. 165–167) and is corroborated byal-Tabariand others. Muhammad, while recitingSurah an-Najm(Qur'an 53:1-20), allegedly spoke favorably of pagan deities al-Lāt, al-‘Uzzā, and Manāt:“These are the exalted cranes (gharānīq) whose intercession is to be hoped for.”This utterance, later acknowledged by Gabriel as satanic interpolation, profoundly impacted early Islam. Qur'an 22:52 later attempted to theologically sanitize the event:“Never did We send a Messenger or a Prophet before you, but when he did recite the revelation, Satan threw some (falsehood) in it. But Allah abolishes that which Satan throws in…”Theologically, this episode undermines the Islamic claim of incorruptible prophetic transmission.D. Paradoxical Marriages in ParadiseInSunan Ibn Majah(Zuhd 39), Muhammad claimed:“Everyone that Allah admits into Paradise will be married to seventy-two wives: two of them houris and seventy of his inheritance from the dwellers of Hell…”This disturbing eschatological teaching suggests sexual relations between Paradise dwellers and women from Hell, challenging the moral coherence of Islamic paradise and further implicating a potential collusion between Hell and Heaven.E. Allah as “The Best of Deceivers”InQur'an 3:54, Allah is described as:“The best of deceivers (makireena).”Biblical theology reserves the title of deceiver for Satan alone (Revelation 12:9):“And the great dragon was hurled down — that ancient serpent called the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world.”The moral character of a deity self-described as a deceiver starkly contrasts with the immutable, holy nature of the God of the Bible.F. Muhammad’s Encounter with a Possessed WomanAccording toSunan Al Daraqutni(Vol. 1, p. 739):“A woman possessed by the devil claimed, ‘I am Allah,’ and Muhammad, frightened, fled from her.”The prophet’s reaction to demonic possession, coupled with the entity’s claim of divinity, raises disturbing implications about Muhammad's perception of the supernatural.G. Muhammad’s “Satan” Abandoning HimInSahih Bukhari(Vol. 6, Book 60, Hadith no. 475), it is recorded:“O Muhammad! I think that your Satan has forsaken you, for I have not seen him with you for two or three nights.”This was in reference to the temporary lapse in Muhammad’s revelations, leading to the subsequent Qur'anic reassurance (Qur'an 93:1-3). The accusation that Muhammad was accompanied by a personal Satan was not refuted, but instead dismissed by an appeal to revelation — a weak apologetic defense.ConclusionThe Islamic primary sources themselves, when examined critically and comparatively, demonstrate troubling accounts of satanic influence on Muhammad's prophetic claims. The contradictions within Islamic tradition, particularly regarding divine communication, the Satanic verses incident, and the moral attributes ascribed to Allah, call into question the reliability of Muhammad’s prophethood. The Biblical standard of prophetic consistency, moral holiness, and unassailable divine nature stands in sharp contrast to the theological inconsistencies evident in early Islam.ReferencesSahih Al-Bukhari, Vol. 4, Book 54, Hadith no. 438Sunan Abu Dawud, Book 34, Hadith no. 4218Umdah al-Ahkam, Vol. 3, Hadith no. 460Ibn Ishaq,The Life of Muhammad, pp. 165-167Qur'an 22:52,The Noble Qur’anSunan Ibn Majah, Zuhd 39Qur'an 3:54,The Noble Qur’anRevelation 12:9,The Holy BibleSunan Al Daraqutni, Vol. 1, p. 739Sahih Bukhari, Vol. 6, Book 60, Hadith no. 475",

    "full_content": "Allah and Muhammad Declared That the Bible Is Truth: A Theological ExaminationBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteAbstractMuslim apologists often claim that the Bible has been corrupted over time. However, a careful examination of the Qur'an and early Islamic traditions reveals that both Allah and Muhammad acknowledged the Torah and the Gospel (Injeel) as divine revelations and sources of truth. This paper presents a systematic compilation of Qur'anic verses and Hadith references affirming the authenticity of the earlier Scriptures, thereby challenging the popular claim of biblical corruption within Islamic polemics.1. Affirmation of Earlier Revelations in the Qur'anThe Qur'an repeatedly emphasizes the continuity of divine revelation, placing the Torah, Psalms, and Gospel within the same sacred lineage as the Qur'an. Several passages explicitly command belief in the Scriptures given to previous prophets.Qur'an 2:136“Say [O believers], ‘We have believed in Allah and what has been revealed to us and what has been revealed to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the Descendants and what was given to Moses and Jesus and what was given to the prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and we are Muslims [in submission] to Him.’”Qur'an 2:4“And who believe in what has been sent down to you [Muhammad], and in what was sent down before you, and they believe with certainty in the Hereafter.”These verses affirm the revealed status of the earlier Scriptures and command Muslims to believe in them without distinction.2. Qur'anic Testimony to the Validity of the Torah and GospelThe Qur'an not only acknowledges the previous Scriptures but also presents them as ongoing authorities for the People of the Book.Qur'an 3:2–3“Allah – there is no deity except Him, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of existence. He has sent down upon you [O Muhammad], the Book in truth, confirming what was before it. And He revealed the Torah and the Gospel.”Qur'an 4:136“O you who have believed, believe in Allah and His Messenger and the Book that He sent down upon His Messenger and the Scripture which He sent down before.”These passages confirm both the Qur'an and the prior Scriptures as authoritative revelations from the same divine source.3. Command to Judge by the Torah and GospelIn a striking affirmation, the Qur'an instructs the People of the Book to judge by their Scriptures, implying their reliability and authority at the time of Muhammad.Qur'an 5:47“And let the People of the Gospel judge by what Allah has revealed therein. And whoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed – then it is those who are the defiantly disobedient.”Qur'an 5:68“Say, ‘O People of the Scripture, you have no ground to stand upon unless you uphold the Torah, the Gospel, and what has been revealed to you from your Lord.’”These verses would have been meaningless if the Scriptures had been corrupted, for no Prophet of God would command judgment by a falsified text.4. The Qur'an’s Recognition of the People of the BookSeveral Qur'anic passages acknowledge the People of the Book and recognize the unity of God worshipped by both communities.Qur'an 29:46“And do not argue with the People of the Scripture except in a way that is best… and say, ‘We believe in that which has been revealed to us and revealed to you. And our God and your God is one; and we are Muslims [in submission] to Him.’”This intertextual acknowledgment presumes the Scriptures of the People of the Book retained their validity.5. Confirmation of the Torah by MuhammadThe Hadith literature provides a remarkable episode where Muhammad personally affirmed the truth of the Torah.Sunan Abu Dawud, Book 38, Number 4434“A group of Jews came and invited the Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) to Quff. They said: AbulQasim, one of our men has committed fornication. They placed a cushion for the Apostle of Allah who sat on it and said: ‘Bring the Torah.’ It was then brought. He then withdrew the cushion from beneath him and placed the Torah on it saying: ‘I believed in thee and in Him Who revealed thee.’”This authentic narration affirms Muhammad’s recognition of the Torah’s authority.6. Waraqa bin Nawfal and the GospelAnother significant testimony comes from the early Islamic tradition, which records the involvement of Waraqa bin Nawfal, a Christian relative of Khadijah, in translating the Gospel into Arabic.Sahih al-Bukhari 4953“Waraqa had been converted to Christianity in the pre-Islamic period and used to write the Gospel in Arabic as much as Allah wished him to write.”The reverence shown to the Gospel here reflects its perceived sacred status in early Islamic narratives.7. Jesus’ Confirmation of the TorahEven within the Qur'anic portrayal of Jesus, he is presented as confirming the Torah and announcing further divine guidance.Qur'an 61:6“And when Jesus son of Mary said: ‘O Children of Israel! Lo! I am the messenger of Allah unto you, confirming that which was before me in the Torah, and bringing good tidings of a messenger who shall come after me, whose name is Ahmad.’”This testimony reflects continuity, not corruption, of the previous Scriptures.ConclusionThe Qur'anic affirmations and early Islamic traditions reveal a consistent acknowledgment of the Torah and Gospel as authentic, divine revelations. These texts are portrayed as valid during the lifetime of Muhammad and even commanded as legal authorities for their respective communities. This evidence fundamentally challenges the later Islamic polemic that the Bible has been irredeemably corrupted. A faithful reading of the Qur'an and Hadith requires acknowledging the Torah and Gospel as reliable Scriptures within the Islamic prophetic tradition.ReferencesThe Qur'an: Surahs 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 21, 29, 61Sahih al-Bukhari, Hadith 4953Sunan Abu Dawud, Book 38, Number 4434",

    "full_content": "The Missing Baptism: A Critical Theological Challenge to the Qur'anic Representation of Yahya (John the Baptist)By Dr. Maxwell Shimba | Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractWhile the Qur'an claims to affirm the Torah, the Psalms, and the Gospel, significant theological practices such as baptism — foundational in the biblical narrative through the ministry of John the Baptist — are conspicuously absent from the Islamic scripture and practice. This article critically examines the portrayal of Yahya (John the Baptist) in the Qur'an, his omission as a baptizer, and the broader Islamic rejection of baptism, exposing this as a fundamental failure of the Qur'an to substantiate its claim as a confirmation of prior divine revelation. Moreover, it interrogates the credibility of Muhammad’s prophethood against the biblical and prophetic tradition, highlighting Islam’s theological gaps and inconsistencies.IntroductionIslam asserts that the Qur'an was sent as a confirmation of the scriptures before it — namely the Torah (Tawrat), Psalms (Zabur), and Gospel (Injil). However, one of the profound practices attested to in both the Old and New Testaments —baptism— finds no place in the Qur'an nor in the practice of Prophet Muhammad. Even more perplexing is the Qur'anic mention of Yahya (John the Baptist), a figure known exclusively in biblical history for his ministry of baptism, without a single reference to his baptizing mission. This theological inconsistency raises critical questions about the reliability of the Qur'anic narrative and its authenticity as divine revelation.The Absence of Baptism in the Qur'anThe Bible unmistakably records John the Baptist as “the voice of one crying in the wilderness” (Isaiah 40:3; Matthew 3:3), who baptized multitudes and notably Jesus Christ himself (Matthew 3:13-17). Baptism was a profound symbol of repentance and spiritual renewal, central to John’s prophetic office.Yet, the Qur'an — despite mentioning Yahya multiple times (Qur'an 19:7-15; 3:39) — is entirely silent on his role as a baptizer. This omission is deeply problematic. If the Qur'an is truly a confirmation of the Gospel, why does it fail to affirm one of the most public, prophetic, and messianic acts in Christian theology: the baptism of Jesus by John?Furthermore,baptism is absent as a religious rite in Islam. No command, narrative, or practice of baptism exists in the Qur'an, nor was Muhammad himself baptized, a stark divergence from the prophetic pattern in which Jesus partook of baptism, and His disciples continued the practice (Acts 2:38-41).This silence leads to a series of theological and historical questions:Why does Yahya not baptize in the Qur'an if he is the same historical person as John the Baptist?Why is baptism neither preserved nor practiced in Islam if the Qur'an claims to affirm the Gospel?Why did Muhammad, whom Muslims claim to be the seal of prophets, not undergo baptism?Why is there no record of baptism among Muhammad’s followers in the earliest Islamic community?These questions reveal severe discontinuity between the biblical and Qur'anic narratives, undermining the Qur'an’s claim to authenticate prior revelations.The Puzzling Name ‘Yahya’ — A Non-Historical AnomalyAnother significant concern is the name‘Yahya’itself. The Qur'an names John the Baptist asYahya, a designationabsent from the Hebrew Bible, Jewish historical records, or even Christian texts. The biblical and historical name isYochananin Hebrew, translatedJohnin English, andYuhannain Arabic — a name preserved in the Arabic Bible to this day.This anomaly raises pressing historical and philological questions:What is the origin of the name Yahya?Why is it unknown in Jewish and Christian records, including ancient Aramaic, Hebrew, Greek, and even early Arabic Christian writings?Why did the Qur'an introduce a non-historical name while claiming to recount the same prophetic history?Such discrepancies suggest that the Qur'anic authors may have lacked direct knowledge of biblical texts or relied on altered oral traditions, further casting doubt on the Qur'an's claim of confirming prior scripture.Theological Incoherence: If Yahya Was a Muslim, Why No Baptism in Islam?Muslim exegetes claim all biblical prophets were Muslims, including Yahya. If so, why was Yahya’s defining prophetic act — baptism — neither continued nor affirmed in Islam? Why did Prophet Muhammad, regarded as the seal of the prophets, not institute baptism as part of Islamic ritual, especially when he claimed to follow the prophetic traditions?The Qur'an’s failure to even acknowledge baptism exposes a theological inconsistency:If Yahya was a Muslim prophet, as Islam claims, why did he baptize while other Muslim prophets allegedly did not?Why did this practice, supposedly divinely sanctioned, vanish entirely by the time of Muhammad?How does the absence of baptism reconcile with Islam’s claim of confirming the Gospel when baptism was central to Jesus’s ministry (Mark 1:9-11) and commanded to His disciples (Matthew 28:19)?This theological incoherence suggests either a historical break between Islam and authentic biblical tradition or that Islam emerged independently, borrowing selectively from biblical narratives without preserving their core theological meanings.Conclusion: An Unsubstantiated Claim of ContinuityThe absence of baptism in Islam — both in scripture and practice — alongside the historically untraceable name ‘Yahya’ and the omission of John the Baptist’s defining ministry, exposes a fatal flaw in the Qur'an’s claim to confirm previous revelations. Muhammad’s prophetic credentials further suffer when contrasted against biblical standards, as he neither underwent baptism nor acknowledged it as a divine ordinance.This glaring omission reveals thatthe Qur'an is neither a faithful confirmation of the Gospel nor a continuation of the authentic prophetic tradition. Instead, it selectively appropriates biblical figures while detaching them from their historical and theological contexts.In this light, the Qur'an’s claim to divine origin becomes increasingly untenable. It fails to meet the very standards it sets for itself — to affirm the prior books — and thereby exposes itself, and Muhammad, as inconsistent with the tradition it professes to uphold.ReferencesThe Holy Bible, New International Version.The Qur'an (Translations by Yusuf Ali, Pickthall, and Sahih International)Encyclopaedia Judaica, “John the Baptist”Geisler, Norman L. & Saleeb, Abdul.Answering Islam: The Crescent in Light of the CrossGuillaume, A.The Life of Muhammad: A Translation of Ibn Ishaq's Sirat Rasul Allah",

    "full_content": "The Incompleteness and Unreliability of the Quran: A Critical Analysis of Textual Gaps and Hadith DependencyBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThe Quran, revered by Muslims as the final and perfect revelation of Allah, asserts itself as a complete, clear, and detailed book for guidance. However, a closer academic analysis exposes significant textual gaps, ambiguities, and the need for external sources — primarily the Hadith — to clarify essential doctrines, laws, and historical narratives. This paper critically examines one such case: the narrative of Adam’s sons, their identities, actions, and familial relations, as well as the Quran’s silence on critical details. Furthermore, it interrogates whether the Quran itself mandates the use of Hadith, concluding it does not. This article contends that the Quran is incomplete for doctrinal and historical instruction and ultimately unreliable as a self-sufficient religious text.IntroductionThe Islamic tradition holds that the Quran is“a book wherein there is no doubt, a guidance for the righteous”(Quran 2:2). It frequently claims to confirm prior scriptures (Torah, Psalms, Gospel) and asserts to be a comprehensive record of divine will. Yet, modern and classical scholars have long debated its sufficiency and clarity when detached from the Hadith corpus. Among the most glaring examples of these deficiencies is the narrative ofAdam's sons. Unlike the Bible, which clearly identifies them asCain and Abel (Genesis 4:1-8), the Quran omits their names and key contextual details.The Case of Adam’s Sons: Missing Names and DetailsIn the Quran, the story of Adam's sons is briefly mentioned inSurah Al-Ma'idah (5:27-31):“And recite to them the story of Adam's two sons, in truth, when they both offered a sacrifice, and it was accepted from one of them but not from the other. Said (the latter), ‘I will surely kill you.’ Said (the former), ‘Indeed, Allah only accepts from the righteous.’”(5:27)This passage confirms neither the names of these sons nor their mother’s identity. By contrast, in theBible— considered part of the prior revelations Islam claims to affirm — their names areCain and Abel, and their mother isEve(Genesis 4:1-2).The Quran fails to mention:The names of Adam’s sons.The identity of their mother.The specific type of sacrifices offered.The motive behind the rejection and murder.The actual act of killing.These vital details are instead supplied byHadithliterature and theTafsir (commentaries), drawn largely fromBiblical narrativesandJewish oral traditions (Isra'iliyyat). This dependence suggests the Quran alone is insufficient for understanding even basic historical events it mentions.Who Killed Whom? According to the QuranWithinSurah 5:27-31, it’s indicated that one son killed the other due to jealousy after a sacrifice was accepted by Allah from one but rejected from the other. However, thenames of the perpetrator and victim are entirely absent. Islamic exegetes universally agree, based onHadith and Biblical borrowing, thatQabil (Cain)killedHabil (Abel).But importantly —the Quran itself never names them. This silence is critical. A supposedly clear and detailed book (Quran 12:111; 16:89) leaves out core identifiers in a pivotal moral narrative.The Identity of Their Mother in the QuranSimilarly, the Quran does not mentionEve (Hawwa)by nameanywhere. She is only indirectly referred to as Adam’s \"mate\" (Quran 7:19, 20:117). This contrasts sharply with the Bible’s clarity in Genesis 3:20. Islamic scholars compensate for this by relying on Hadith and Jewish traditions.Is the Use of Hadith Authorized by the Quran?Despite the indispensable role ofHadithin explaining Quranic ambiguities, the Quran itselfnever instructs Muslims to refer to Hadith for religious or legal authority. The Quran insists it is“fully detailed”(6:114, 12:111) and “complete” (5:3).Yet, Islamic jurisprudence and theology lean heavily onHadith collections(e.g., Sahih al-Bukhari, Sahih Muslim) for:Details on daily prayers (number, method, timings)Ritual acts like Hajj and ZakatCriminal lawHistorical narratives like Adam’s sonsThis reliance reveals a contradiction: a text claiming completeness yet requiring supplementary literature for interpretation and application.Nowhere in the Quran does Allah command Muslims to read, follow, or preserve Hadith literature.The word‘Hadith’in the Quran typically refers to a “narration” or “story” and is even warned against in several verses when it distracts from Allah’s revelations (e.g., 31:6).Quran’s Claim to Affirm Prior Books and Its FailureThe Quran claims to affirm and confirm the Torah, Psalms, and Gospel (e.g., 5:46, 5:48). Yet, it diverges significantly in both narrative details and theological conclusions. The Adam’s sons narrative is a prime example — lacking names and details found clearly in Genesis 4.Further, the Quran denounces the Bible as corrupted (e.g., 2:79), while simultaneously claiming to confirm it. This creates a theological inconsistency: affirming a revelation it accuses of being unreliable, while depending on it indirectly throughHadithandIsra'iliyyattraditions.ConclusionThis academic review of the Quran’s handling of the Adam’s sons narrative demonstrates a broader issue: the Quran is incomplete as a self-sufficient religious text. Its gaps necessitate external sources, especially Hadith, for clarification. Moreover, nowhere does the Quran command the preservation or authority of Hadith literature.The logical conclusion is that Islam’s foundational text cannot stand independently. It is neither a fully detailed account nor a consistent confirmation of prior scriptures, as it claims. This renders the Quran anunreliable and incomplete source for comprehensive theological, legal, or historical guidance.ReferencesQuran 2:2, 5:3, 5:27-31, 6:114, 12:111, 16:89, 31:6Genesis 4:1-8, 3:20Sahih al-Bukhari, Sahih MuslimAl-Tabari,Tafsir al-TabariAl-Qurtubi,Tafsir al-QurtubiGoldziher, Ignác.Muhammedanische Studien(1889)Wansbrough, John.Quranic Studies: Sources and Methods of Scriptural Interpretation(1977)",

    "full_content": "A Contradiction Within the QuranBy Dr. Max ShimbaMax Shimba MinistriesIntroductionThis issue represents a significant theological discrepancy within Islamic scripture — a contradiction between the historical record preserved in the Hebrew Bible and the later narrative presented in the Quran. The core question is simple yet deeply consequential for scriptural integrity:Who rescued Moses from the Nile — Pharaoh’s daughter or Pharaoh’s wife?The Biblical AccountAccording to the Holy Bible, when Pharaoh sought to kill all Hebrew male infants, God intervened to save Moses by causing Pharaoh’sdaughterto adopt the child and raise him as her own. The account is clearly detailed in the book of Exodus:\"And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi. And the woman conceived, and bore a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months. And when she could no longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river’s brink. And his sister stood afar off, to see what would be done to him. And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river’s side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it. And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, 'This is one of the Hebrews' children.' Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, 'Shall I go and call thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?' And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, 'Go.' And the maid went and called the child’s mother. And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, 'Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages.' And the woman took the child, and nursed it. And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, 'Because I drew him out of the water.'\"—Exodus 2:1–10 (KJV)This is affirmed again in the New Testament:\"And when he was cast out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son.\"—Acts 7:21 (KJV)The Quranic AccountOver two millennia later, the Quran presents a conflicting version of this historical episode, asserting that it wasPharaoh's wife— not his daughter — who rescued and adopted Moses. The Quran states:\"And We inspired the mother of Moses, saying: 'Suckle him, and when thou fearest for him, then cast him into the river and fear not, nor grieve. Lo! We shall bring him back unto thee, and shall make him (one) of Our messengers.' And the family of Pharaoh took him up, that he might become for them an enemy and a sorrow. Lo! Pharaoh and Haman and their hosts were ever sinning. And the wife of Pharaoh said: 'A comfort for me and for thee! Kill him not. He may be of use to us, or we may adopt him as a son.' And they perceived not.\"—Surah 28:7–9 (Pickthall Translation)Here, it is explicitly Pharaoh'swifewho intervenes and claims the infant Moses.Evaluating the ContradictionGiven that the Hebrew Bible, authored by Moses himself (according to longstanding Jewish and Christian tradition), was written far closer to the time of these events, it would logically hold greater historical reliability. The Israelites, as direct participants and custodians of their national history, would certainly have accurately preserved the identity of Moses' rescuer.Additionally, the Quran itself instructs Muslims to consult the People of the Book (Jews and Christians) regarding earlier revelations and sacred history:\"And if you (Muhammad) are in doubt concerning that which We reveal unto you, then ask those who read the Scripture (that was) before you. Verily the Truth from your Lord has come unto you. So be not of the doubters.\"—Surah 10:94 (Pickthall)\"And verily We gave unto Moses nine clear signs. Ask the Children of Israel how he came unto them, and Pharaoh said unto him: 'Lo! I deem thee one bewitched, O Moses.'\"—Surah 17:101 (Shakir)Further, the Quran claims that Jesus himself confirmed the authority of the Hebrew Torah available in his day:\"He will teach him the Scripture and wisdom, and the Torah and the Gospel.\" ... \"'And (I have come) confirming that which was before me of the Torah and to make lawful for you some of what was forbidden to you. I have come to you with a sign from your Lord. So fear God and obey me.'\"—Surah 3:47, 49 (Khalifa)\"And in their footsteps, We sent Jesus son of Mary, confirming the Torah that came before him; and We gave him the Gospel, wherein is guidance and light, and confirming the Torah that preceded it, a guidance and an admonition for the righteous.\"—Surah 5:46 (Khalifa)ConclusionGiven the corroborative testimony of the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament, and even Quranic endorsements of these scriptures, it becomes clear that the biblical account — which identifies Pharaoh’sdaughteras Moses' rescuer — is historically and theologically sound.In contrast, the Quran’s claim that it was Pharaoh’swiferepresents a critical historical error, undermining its claim to confirm previous scriptures.As a result, we must conclude that:The Holy Bible remains historically consistent and theologically reliable.The Quran’s contradiction on this matter reveals its fallibility as a later historical source.Shalom.Dr. Max ShimbaMax Shimba Ministries",

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaMax Shimba MinistriesIntroductionIt is often observed that Muslims criticize Christians for praying while wearing shoes inside their churches. The question arises — did the Prophet of Islam, Muhammad, himself pray with his shoes on while inside the mosque? In this paper, we examine this issue using primary Islamic sources and authenticated Hadith compilations to evaluate the practice of the Prophet and the instruction he gave regarding footwear during prayer.Prophet Muhammad’s Practice of Praying with ShoesAccording to several Hadith reports, Prophet Muhammad indeed prayed with his shoes on inside the mosque. This is evident in the narration found in the bookAl-Ulu wal-Marjan:“Permission to pray with shoes.”Anas bin Malik (R.A) narrated from Sa‘id bin Yazid Al-Azdi (R.A), who said:“I asked Anas bin Malik (R.A), ‘Did the Prophet (S.A.W) pray while wearing his shoes?’ He replied, ‘Yes.’”—(Al-Bukhari, Hadith No. 383, Vol. 1)This narration explicitly indicates that Prophet Muhammad performed prayers while wearing his shoes, and a specific chapter title in this collection grants permission for such a practice.Instructions Regarding Cleanliness of ShoesThe Prophet not only prayed with his shoes on but also gave instructions to his followers concerning the cleanliness of their footwear before prayer. This is recorded inBulugh al-Maram min Jam’i Adillatil Ahkam:Hadith No. 171:Abu Sa‘id Al-Khudri (R.A) reported that the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) said:“When any one of you comes to the mosque, let him look at his shoes. If he finds filth (najasah) on them, let him wipe them off and then pray in them.”—(Reported by Abu Dawood, Ibn Khuzaymah graded it Sahih)The commentary explains that if someone steps on filth with their shoes, they can purify them by rubbing them against the ground or soil until the impurity is removed.Further Instruction Regarding Shoes and Safety in the MosqueAn additional narration shows that Prophet Muhammad expected worshippers to have their shoes available during prayer for practical reasons. In a situation involving a scorpion inside the mosque, the Prophet instructed:“Whoever amongst you sees a scorpion while praying should kill it with his left shoe.”—(Mkweli Mwaminifu, Vol. 1-2, Hadith No. 188, p. 88)This command implies that Muslims would have their shoes on or immediately accessible even while engaged in prayer.DiscussionThe consistent theme from these narrations is that the Prophet of Islam not only allowed but also performed prayer while wearing shoes, as long as they were clean. The practice of removing shoes before prayer was a later custom influenced by differing cultural and environmental factors, particularly as mosques began using rugs and carpets.Consequently, it appears inconsistent when Muslims criticize Christians for praying while wearing shoes in church buildings, especially when the founder of their own faith engaged in the practice and instructed others to do so.The critique here is not merely about footwear etiquette but about the double standards in religious polemics. If the Prophet prayed in shoes and permitted it conditionally, it undermines the argument that Christian practices of praying with shoes are impure or disrespectful.ConclusionThis study of primary Islamic texts confirms that Prophet Muhammad did pray in his shoes within the mosque and allowed his followers to do the same, provided their shoes were clean. Thus, the polemic against Christians praying with shoes appears to be unfounded, especially in light of these authenticated narrations.ReferencesAl-Bukhari, Muhammad ibn Ismail.Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 1, Hadith No. 383.Ibn Hajar Al-Asqalani.Bulugh al-Maram min Jam’i Adillatil Ahkam.

All Rights ReservedIntroductionEvery religious adherent believes in the existence of a supreme being responsible for the creation of humanity, animals, the visible and invisible worlds. However, it is worth examining what both Yehovah, the God of the Bible, and Allah, the deity described in the Qur’an, claim about creation. Do their statements align or conflict? Whose image was man created in?This paper aims to provide a comparative theological examination between the Biblical and Qur’anic declarations regarding the Creator, presenting a scholarly analysis of both sources to ascertain the nature of the divine being responsible for creation.Allah’s Declaration about HimselfThe Qur’an makes the following assertion:Qur’an 112:1-4 (Suratul Al-Ikhlas)“Say: He is Allah, the One and Only. Allah, the Eternal, Absolute. He begets not, nor is He begotten. And there is none like unto Him.”According to this passage, Allah affirms that he neither begets nor is begotten and explicitly states that no one is like him.Yehovah’s Declaration about HimselfConversely, the Bible records:Genesis 1:26-27 (KJV)\"And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.\"Here, Yehovah declares that mankind was made in His image and likeness. This sharply contrasts with the Qur’anic claim where Allah declares that no one is like him.Additional Biblical Texts Affirming Man’s Divine LikenessGenesis 5:1-2Genesis 9:61 Corinthians 11:7Colossians 1:15; 3:10Acts 17:28-29James 3:9While some might inquire how God resembles humanity, the Scriptures clarify that God is spirit (John 4:24), and He breathed into man the breath of life (Genesis 2:7). He is also the Father of our spirits (Hebrews 12:9) and claims ownership over all souls (Ezekiel 18:4; Numbers 16:22).Swearing by Creation: Allah versus YehovahAllah’s OathsThe Qur’an records several instances of Allah swearing by His creation:Qur’an 91:1-7 (Suratul Ash-Shams)“By the sun and its brightness, by the moon as it follows it, by the day as it displays it, by the night as it covers it, by the heaven and Him who built it, by the earth and Him who spread it out, and by the soul and Him who perfected it.”Qur’an 92:1-3 (Suratul Al-Layl)“By the night as it envelops, by the day as it appears, and by Him who created male and female.”Here, Allah swears by the created order, something foreign to the Biblical God, Yehovah.Yehovah’s Solemn OathsIsaiah 45:22-23 (KJV)“Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else.I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, That unto me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.”Hebrews 6:13-16 (KJV)“For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself,Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife.”Unlike Allah, Yehovah swears solely by Himself, as He alone is supreme and uncreated (see also Isaiah 14:24; Genesis 22:16).Creator of the Heavens and the Earth: Allah’s and Yehovah’s ClaimsQur’an 45:22 (Surat Al-Jathiyah)“And Allah created the heavens and the earth with truth…”Qur’an 44:7-8 (Surat Ad-Dukhan)“The Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them, if you should be convinced. There is no deity except Him; He gives life and causes death — your Lord and the Lord of your first forefathers.”Isaiah 44:24 (KJV)“Thus saith the LORD, thy redeemer, and he that formed thee from the womb, I am the LORD that maketh all things; that stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself.”Isaiah 45:6-7, 11-12; Jeremiah 27:5Further affirmations declare Yehovah as the sole Creator of heaven and earth.ConclusionThe theological distinctions between the Biblical Yehovah and the Qur’anic Allah are significant. While both claim to be the Creator, their nature, method of swearing, and relationship to humanity fundamentally differ. Yehovah creates man in His image, swears by Himself alone, and consistently affirms His personal involvement in creation. Allah, conversely, denies resemblance to His creation and swears by created things, marking a clear divergence in divine nature and theology.ReferencesThe Holy Bible, King James Version (KJV)The Qur’an, Abdullah Yusuf Ali TranslationJohn 4:24Genesis 1:26-27; 2:7; 5:1-2; 9:6Isaiah 44:24; 45:6-7, 11-12; 14:24Hebrews 6:13-16; 12:9Ezekiel 18:4Numbers 16:221 Corinthians 11:7Colossians 1:15; 3:10Acts 17:28-29James 3:9In His Service,Dr. Maxwell ShimbaMax Shimba Ministries Org ©2015",

Utilizing primary Islamic sources, notably the Hadith literature, and biblical texts, this study explores the doctrinal implications of the afterlife in both traditions. The article concludes by highlighting the divergent eschatological promises of Allah and Elohim (Yahweh) and discusses their theological and soteriological consequences.IntroductionThe concept of life after death is central to both Islamic and Christian theology. However, the respective eschatological promises presented by the Qur’anic Allah and the Biblical Elohim exhibit significant doctrinal divergences. While Christian theology affirms immediate assurance of salvation and eternal life upon faith in Jesus Christ (John 5:24; 1 John 5:11-13), Islamic traditions, particularly Hadith literature, depict a complex and uncertain postmortem journey even for devout Muslims, including Muhammad himself.This study examines key Hadith narratives to evaluate Muhammad’s eschatological expectations and contrasts them with the Biblical assurance of eternal life, drawing a theological distinction between Allah and Elohim.Islamic Eschatology in Hadith LiteratureOne of the most revealing Hadiths concerning the eschatological destiny of Muhammad is found inSahih al-Bukhari(Vol. 1, Book 12, Hadith 770):“Then Allah will come to them again and say, ‘I am your Lord.’ They will say, ‘You are our Lord.’ Allah will call them, and As-Sirat (a bridge) will be laid across Hell and I (Muhammad) shall be the first amongst the Apostles to cross it with my followers... and some of them will fall and stay in Hell forever.” (Al-Bukhari, 1997)This Hadith explicitly states that Muhammad himself awaits the Day of Judgment to cross As-Sirat into Paradise, a fate that contrasts sharply with Biblical prophets who, according to Scripture, secured their eternal destinies during their earthly lives (Psalm 23:6; Isaiah 38:17-18).Furthermore,Sahih al-Bukhari(Vol. 1, Book 8, Hadith 345) narrates Muhammad’s claim of a visionary ascent into heaven where he allegedly encountered Adam, Moses, Jesus, and Abraham while still alive. Yet, paradoxically, Islamic eschatology postpones his final admission into Paradise until the Day of Judgment.Biblical Theology of Salvation and Eternal LifeIn contrast, the Bible emphasizes the immediacy and certainty of salvation for believers. Isaiah 38:17-18 and Psalm 51:12 articulate Old Testament assurances of forgiveness and eternal life within one’s earthly existence. The New Testament expands on this doctrine:\"Most assuredly, I say to you, he who hears My word and believes in Him who sent Me has everlasting life and shall not come into judgment but has passed from death into life.\" (John 5:24, NKJV)Jesus' declaration underscores the immediacy of eternal life for believers without the intermediary of hellfire or a postmortem bridge. Moreover, in John 4:10 and John 7:38, Jesus promises the 'living water' (Holy Spirit) to believers in their earthly lives, affirming salvation as a present reality.Doctrinal Contradictions and Theological ImplicationsThe cited Hadiths suggest that even monotheistic Muslims are consigned to Hell temporarily, to be identified and rescued by angels based on the marks of prostration (sujud).Sahih al-Bukharistates:\"He will order the angels to take out of Hell those who worshipped none but Him alone… So they will come out of the Fire as mere skeletons. The Water of Life will be poured on them.\" (Al-Bukhari, 1997)This conditional posthumous mercy starkly contrasts with Christian soteriology, which offers the assurance of immediate postmortem communion with God (Luke 23:43). The theological implication is clear: the Qur’anic Allah provides no definitive assurance of eternal life before death, unlike the Biblical Elohim.ConclusionThis comparative analysis reveals a profound theological and eschatological divergence between Islamic and Christian doctrines of the afterlife. The Hadith literature portrays a precarious postmortem future for even the most devout Muslims, including Muhammad. In contrast, the Bible guarantees eternal life and salvation in the present life for those who accept Jesus Christ. This doctrinal contrast necessitates a critical reflection on the nature of divine promises and their implications for believers.ReferencesAl-Bukhari, M. I. (1997).Sahih al-Bukhari(Vol. 1).

Today, I intend to provide several examples as evidence that Allah, as portrayed in Islamic texts, possesses anthropomorphic attributes akin to those of human beings. Let us embark on this inquiry together, examining this matter through the Quran, Hadith, and classical Islamic literature.1. Allah Acknowledges Having a Face (Wajh)The Quran explicitly refers to the 'face' of Allah:\"To Allah belong the East and the West. So wherever you turn, there is the Face of Allah. Indeed, Allah is all-Encompassing and Knowing.\" (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:115)In this verse, Allah is said to possess a 'face' (Arabic:wajh), which implies an anthropomorphic feature. Is having a 'face' not a characteristic of created beings?Additionally:\"Everything will perish except His Face.\" (Surah Al-Qasas 28:88)Again, Allah claims that only His 'face' will remain after the annihilation of all else. This explicit claim implies that Allah has a literal face.2. Allah’s Eyes and TearsClassical Islamic literature also attributes eyes and tears to Allah. InAl-Milal wa al-Nihal, it is reported:\"At one time, the Eyes of Allah ached, and the angels went to visit Him. Allah shed tears over the Flood of Prophet Nuh (Noah) until His Eyes became red.\" (Al-Milal wa al-Nihal, Volume 1, p. 141)Although some Muslims may dismiss this narration as weak (da’if) and not found within the Quran, it still represents a documented claim in classical Islamic theology.3. Allah’s Eyes and the 'Kafir' InscriptionAnas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said:\"There was no Prophet sent but that he warned his people about the one-eyed liar (Dajjal). Behold! He is one-eyed, and your Lord is not one-eyed. And between his eyes is written 'Kafir' (disbeliever).\" (Sahih al-Bukhari, Hadith No. 245, Volume 9)Here, Muhammad distinguishes between the Dajjal, who has one eye, and Allah, who does not have one eye, implying Allah has two.4. Allah Hears and SeesThe Quran attributes hearing and sight to Allah:\"Indeed, Allah commands you to render trusts to whom they are due and when you judge between people to judge with justice. Excellent is that which Allah instructs you. Indeed, Allah is Ever-Hearing and Ever-Seeing.\" (Surah An-Nisa 4:58)Having faculties such as hearing and sight are attributes of sentient beings, further indicating anthropomorphic qualities ascribed to Allah.ConclusionIt is evident from the foregoing scriptural and classical citations that Allah is consistently described with anthropomorphic features — a face, eyes, the capacity to weep, and sensory faculties such as hearing and sight. This presentation poses a serious theological issue for those who deny any resemblance or likeness between Allah and His creation.May the Lord bless you all abundantly.In His Service,Dr. Maxwell ShimbaMax Shimba Ministries Org ©2015References:Quran 2:115 (Surah Al-Baqarah)Quran 28:88 (Surah Al-Qasas)Al-Milal wa al-Nihal, Volume 1, p. 141Sahih al-Bukhari, Hadith No. 245, Volume 9Quran 4:58 (Surah An-Nisa)Bibliography:Al-Shahrastani, Muhammad ibn Abd al-Karim.Al-Milal wa al-Nihal.

However, an examination of Islamic and Biblical scriptures reveals a distinct difference between the city chosen by Allah in the Qur'an and the city chosen by Jehovah in the Bible. This paper investigates the cities designated as sacred by these two faiths and provides scriptural evidence for each, concluding with a theological analysis of the implications of these differences.The City Chosen by AllahAccording to the Qur'an, Allah chose the city ofMecca (Makkah)as his sacred city. Several verses explicitly affirm this:Surah An-Naml (The Ants) 27:91states:“For me, I have been commanded to serve the Lord of this city (Makkah), Him Who has sanctified it and to Whom belongs all things…”(Qur'an 27:91, Yusuf Ali Translation)Surah Aal-Imran (The Family of Imran) 3:96reads:“The first House (of worship) appointed for men was that at Bakka (another name for Mecca), full of blessing and of guidance for all kinds of beings.”(Qur'an 3:96, Yusuf Ali Translation)Surah Quraysh 106:3-4affirms:“So let them worship the Lord of this House, Who provides them with food against hunger, and with security against fear.”(Qur'an 106:3-4, Yusuf Ali Translation)From these passages, it is evident that Allah, the deity worshipped by Muslims, choseMeccaas his holy city and the site of his sacred house, the Ka’ba. The Prophet Muhammad was also commanded to worship the Lord of this city (Qur'an 27:91). This forms a central pillar of Islamic belief and practice.The City Chosen by JehovahIn contrast, the Bible clearly identifiesJerusalemas the city chosen by Jehovah (YHWH), the God of Israel. This is confirmed in multiple passages:2 Chronicles 6:4-6:“And he said: Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, who with his hands has fulfilled what he promised with his mouth to my father David, saying: Since the day that I brought my people out of the land of Egypt, I have chosen no city in all the tribes of Israel to build a house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any man to be a ruler over my people Israel; but I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there, and have chosen David to be over my people Israel.”(2 Chronicles 6:4-6, KJV)Other Biblical references affirm this divine choice:2 Chronicles 12:13Ezra 6:12Ezra 7:15, 27Psalm 26:8Zechariah 2:12The Hebrew nameYerushalayim(Jerusalem) means “foundation of peace.” Even during their exile, the Israelites would kneel and pray facing Jerusalem, as recorded inDaniel 6:10:“Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.”(Daniel 6:10, KJV)Theological ImplicationThrough these texts, it is evident that the city chosen by Jehovah isJerusalem, while the city chosen by Allah isMecca. This is a significant distinction between the two faiths. While both religions recognize sacred spaces, their choice of cities reflects divergent theological narratives and historical identities. In the Biblical tradition, Jerusalem stands as the eternal city of God (Psalm 132:13-14), whereas in Islam, Mecca holds this esteemed position.This distinction also serves as an indicator that the deity of the Qur'an is not the same as the God of the Bible. The different sacred cities and theological frameworks suggest thatAllah is not Jehovahbut represents a distinct religious construct introduced through Islamic revelation.ConclusionIn summary:The Qur'an designates Meccaas the holy city of Allah, the location of the Ka'ba, and the birthplace of Islam's central religious rites.The Bible identifies Jerusalemas the city of Jehovah, where His name dwells and where the Temple was established for His worship.Therefore, from a scriptural and theological standpoint, it is clear thatAllah of the Qur'an is not the God of the Bible.ReferencesHoly Bible, King James Version.The Qur'an, translated by Abdullah Yusuf Ali.2 Chronicles 6:4-6; 12:13Ezra 6:12; 7:15, 27Psalm 26:8; 132:13-14Daniel 6:10Zechariah 2:12Qur'an 27:91 (Surah An-Naml)Qur'an 3:96 (Surah Aal-Imran)Qur'an 106:3-4 (Surah Quraysh)BibliographyAli, Abdullah Yusuf.The Holy Qur'an: Text, Translation, and Commentary.

    "full_content": "Did Prophet Muhammad Celebrate Christmas? A Structured Apologetic EssayIntroductionWithin interfaith dialogues between Christianity and Islam, one of the most compelling areas of discussion is the historical and theological relationship between Prophet Muhammad and Jesus Christ. While Islam reveres Jesus (ʿĪsā ibn Maryam) as a mighty prophet and Messiah, it officially rejects the doctrines of His divinity and crucifixion. Yet, there exist lesser-known narratives within Islamic literature that suggest Prophet Muhammad might have acknowledged Jesus in ways not commonly recognized today. One such narration claims that Prophet Muhammad celebrated the birthday of Jesus every year on December 25th by inviting Abyssinians (Habesha) to perform in the mosque. This essay seeks to present this claim, analyze its authenticity, and discuss its implications for apologetics and interfaith understanding.Historical Claim: The Celebration of Jesus’ Birth in Early IslamA narration attributed to ʿĀʾisha, the wife of Prophet Muhammad, records:“The Prophet of Allah used to celebrate the birthday of the Prophet Jesus, son of Mary, every year on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month by inviting the Abyssinians who would sing and perform in the mosque.”Source:ʿUmdat al-Akhwān, Volume 4, Page 299.This account describes an annual event that appears strikingly similar to what Christians commemorate as Christmas. The participation of Abyssinians, known historically as one of the first Christian nations, adds weight to the possibility of cultural exchanges between early Muslims and neighboring Christian communities.Textual and Historical AnalysisAuthenticity of the SourceWhile this narration provides a fascinating glimpse into early Islamic social life, its authenticity remains questionable.ʿUmdat al-Akhwānis not among the six canonical Sunni Hadith collections (Sahih al-Bukhari,Sahih Muslim,Sunan Abu Dawood,Sunan al-Tirmidhi,Sunan al-Nasa’i, andSunan Ibn Majah), nor is it recognized in the major Shiite Hadith compilations. Its chains of transmission (isnad) are not documented in prominent biographical dictionaries of Hadith narrators (rijāl literature), raising legitimate concerns about its reliability.However, the context of Abyssinian performances in the mosque is corroborated inSahih al-BukhariandSahih Muslim, where ʿĀʾisha recounts witnessing Abyssinians playing with spears in the mosque during Eid celebrations. This cultural openness suggests that early Islamic society did accommodate artistic and cultural expressions within religious settings, especially among minorities.Possible Cultural InfluenceGiven Islam's emergence in a region surrounded by Christian and Jewish communities, and the Prophet's early interactions with Abyssinian Christians (notably the King of Axum who protected early Muslim refugees), it is conceivable that shared commemorations occurred informally, though not as religiously mandated observances.Apologetic and Theological ImplicationsAffirming the Honor of Jesus in IslamThis narration, even if apocryphal, reinforces the significant position of Jesus in Islamic theology. The Qur’an refers to Jesus asal-Masīḥ(the Messiah) and speaks of His miraculous birth, signs, and ascension (Qur’an 3:45–55; 4:157–158; 5:110). Celebrating His birth within the early Islamic community would reflect continuity with the prophetic tradition and acknowledgment of Jesus' importance in salvation history.Interfaith Harmony and Historical OpennessFor Christian apologists, such a narration is a valuable resource in demonstrating points of convergence between Christianity and Islam. It presents a historical moment where religious boundaries were more fluid and cultural exchange was encouraged within religious spaces. This opens a constructive avenue for promoting modern interfaith understanding, anchored in shared reverence for prophetic figures.Revisiting Contemporary Islamic ProhibitionsToday, many Islamic scholars condemn the celebration of birthdays, including the Prophet Muhammad’s (Mawlid an-Nabi) and other religious commemorations, labeling them as innovations (bidʿah). If such a practice as celebrating Jesus' birth under Muhammad's leadership were ever historically validated, it would challenge rigid contemporary positions and encourage a reevaluation of early Islamic cultural plurality.ConclusionThough the narration fromʿUmdat al-Akhwānlacks robust authentication by canonical Islamic standards, its content offers a fascinating lens through which to consider early Islamic attitudes toward Christianity and its prophetic figures. It suggests a society where interfaith coexistence and cultural exchange were possible and even encouraged under the Prophet’s leadership. For Christian and Muslim scholars alike, this narrative, whether historical or legendary, can serve as a meaningful touchpoint for dialogue about the shared legacies of Jesus Christ and Prophet Muhammad. It also invites deeper reflection on the evolution of religious practices and prohibitions within Islam, compared to its earliest expressions.ReferencesʿUmdat al-Akhwān, Volume 4, Page 299.Sahih al-Bukhari, Hadith No. 949.Sahih Muslim, Book of the Two Eid Festivals.The Qur'an: 3:45–55; 4:157–158; 5:110.",

The reported date—the 25th of the 12th month—coincides withDecember 25th, which is recognized in much of the Christian world asChristmas Day, the celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ.Critical Analysis of the SourceWhile this text is attributed toʿUmdat al-Akhwān, a reference not widely recognized or authenticated within mainstream Sunni or Shia canonical Hadith literature (likeSahih al-Bukhari,Sahih Muslim,Sunan Abu Dawood, etc.), its mention raises questions about early Muslim-Christian relations and mutual recognition of significant prophetic figures.If this tradition holds any historical value, it may reflect a tolerant and inclusive practice in Medina's early Islamic community, where cultural expressions by minorities like the Abyssinians were incorporated into religious gatherings.However, it should be noted:Classical Muslim scholars do not generally record any sanctioned Islamic celebration of Jesus' birthday.The mainstream Islamic position today does not recognize Christmas or Mawlid (Prophet's birthday celebrations) as religiously mandated practices.The concept of celebrating birthdays, including those of prophets, has historically been a point of contention in Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh).Possible Origins and Cultural InfluenceIt is possible that early Muslims, many of whom had close cultural and religious interactions with Christian communities—especially those from Abyssinia, which embraced Christianity long before Islam—might have informally acknowledged Christian feasts within a broader spirit of coexistence.Modern RelevanceIn contemporary interfaith dialogues, references like this can be valuable for promoting mutual respect and historical acknowledgment of shared figures like Jesus, who is honored in Islam as a mighty prophet and the Messiah (al-Masīḥ). It also invites reflection on how religious practices evolve and how early Islamic history was more culturally diverse than often portrayed.ConclusionWhile this narration remains outside the authenticated corpus of Hadith literature, it offers a fascinating lens into early Islamic communal life and possible interactions with Christian customs. It highlights the Prophet Muhammad’s reputed openness to cultural expressions within religious contexts and the potential for harmony between Abrahamic faiths.",

    "full_content": "WHY IS THERE NO HEALING POWER IN ISLAM? YET IN CHRISTIANITY, PEOPLE ARE HEALED IN THE NAME OF JESUS?By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteMax Shimba Ministries, 2015Introduction: What Is Healing?Healing is an act of faith that brings restoration to the soul or the body through prayer, the laying on of hands, or by hearing the true word of Christ Jesus. This faith-based act restores spiritual life and physical health where it has diminished. Notably, in many instances where individuals were physically healed, their souls were also restored.Therefore, we must ask: why was it that when Allah sent Jibril (Gabriel) to pray for the healing of his prophet Muhammad — when he fell ill after consuming poisoned food — their prayer did not succeed?This raises a significant theological inquiry: healing is not performed by any person independently but by God Himself. Even the most highly trained doctors do not heal; they administer treatment, but it is God who heals. God’s servants serve only as a bridge or vessel through which divine healing is delivered to those in need.The Futile Attempt of Allah and Jibril to Heal MuhammadReference:Ibn Sa’d, p. 265Aisha, the wife of the Prophet Muhammad, stated:\"When the Prophet of Allah was ill, Jibril would pray for him to Allah saying: 'In the name of Allah, He will heal you from every disease, from every evil that afflicts you, and from every one who intends harm against you. You will be healed.'\"But was Muhammad truly healed by the name of Allah?Let us examine a reliable hadith as recorded by Al-Bukhari:Bukhari’s Hadith 5.713Narrated by Aisha:\"The Prophet in his final illness would say: ‘O Aisha, I still feel the pain caused by the food I ate at Khaibar, and at this very moment, I feel as though my aorta is being severed from that poison.’”This leads to a crucial theological question:Can God pray and fail? Why did the prayers of Allah and Jibril for Muhammad’s healing prove ineffective?Now, Let Us Examine Jesus in the Bible: Did He Heal the Sick?Matthew 8:14-15“When Jesus came into Peter’s house, He saw Peter’s mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever. He touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she got up and began to serve Him.”The Bible does not record Jesus praying for this woman. What we observe is that Jesus touched her, and the fever immediately left. Merely the touch of a man of God carries healing power, even without uttered prayer, because the anointing resides within him.Even Peter healed the sick by his shadow alone because of the anointing upon him (Acts 5:15).The Importance of Placing Your Faith in the Name of Jesus ChristActs 3:1-8“One day Peter and John were going up to the temple at the time of prayer — at three in the afternoon. Now a man who was lame from birth was being carried to the temple gate called Beautiful, where he was put every day to beg from those going into the temple courts.When he saw Peter and John about to enter, he asked them for money.Peter looked straight at him, as did John. Then Peter said, ‘Look at us!’So the man gave them his attention, expecting to get something from them.Then Peter said, ‘Silver or gold I do not have, but what I do have I give you.In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk.’Taking him by the right hand, he helped him up, and instantly the man’s feet and ankles became strong. He jumped to his feet and began to walk.”When tracing the history of this man’s condition, we find that he had been lame since birth and was over forty years old when healed (Acts 4:22).What was the secret behind this miracle?Did this man walk through the power of Peter and John? Or through the power of the name of Jesus Christ?Many people today place their faith in the minister rather than in the name of Jesus Christ when they see someone being used by God in healing.Peter’s Clarification on the Source of the MiracleWhen the crippled man was healed, the people who witnessed the event were astonished, assuming that Peter and John possessed inherent power. But Peter addressed the crowd:Acts 3:11-12“While the man held on to Peter and John, all the people were astonished and came running to them in the place called Solomon’s Colonnade.When Peter saw this, he said to them: ‘Fellow Israelites, why does this surprise you? Why do you stare at us as if by our own power or godliness we had made this man walk?’”Peter then revealed the true source of this miraculous healing:Acts 3:13-16“The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified His servant Jesus… **By faith in the name of Jesus, this man whom you see and know was made strong. It is Jesus’ name and the faith that comes through Him that has completely healed him, as you can all see.’”Reflect carefully on Peter’s words:“By faith in the name of Jesus, this man… was made strong.”Peter and John placed their faith not in their own strength, but in the name of Jesus Christ. They were certain that the secret to miracles lies in that name — and that is why, when they encountered the crippled man, they commanded him to walkin the name of Jesus.The Early Church’s Commitment to the Name of JesusBecause of this, the early disciples were forbidden to preach or teach in the name of Jesus by Anas, the high priest. Yet when they were threatened, they prayed:Acts 4:18, 29-31“Now, Lord, consider their threats and enable your servants to speak your word with great boldness. Stretch out your hand to heal and perform signs and wonders **through the name of your holy servant Jesus.’”After they prayed, the place where they were meeting was shaken. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God boldly.”Conclusion: The Power of the Name of JesusIt is essential to remind people of the importance of placing their faith in the name of Jesus Christ if they desire to see the hand of the Lord healing and performing miracles in their lives and in their ministries.Dear reader, why waste your time with witch doctors or occultists?Call upon the name of the living Jesus — for He desires to heal all your diseases.If you are suffering from any illness, please contact us throughmaxshimbaministries@gmail.comor call us at(347) 770-4886.No matter the disease, reach out to us — for the name of Jesus will heal you.By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteMax Shimba Ministries, 2015",

    "full_content": "The Confusion in the Qur’an Between Maryam, Sister of Aaron, and Mary, the Mother of JesusBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThe Qur'an, revered by Muslims as the final and perfect revelation, presents numerous narratives drawn from earlier Judeo-Christian traditions. However, a critical textual analysis reveals a historical and genealogical conflation in the identification of Mary, the mother of Jesus, with Maryam, the sister of Aaron and Moses. This scholarly article examines the textual and chronological inconsistencies within the Qur’anic narrative regarding Mary, investigates the implications for Islamic theology, and juxtaposes the Qur’anic portrayal with biblical and historical sources. The study highlights how this confusion raises significant questions about the historical reliability and internal consistency of the Qur’anic text.1. IntroductionIslamic theology affirms the virgin birth of Jesus (Isa) through Mary (Maryam), who is highly revered in the Qur’an. However, the Qur’anic narrative appears to mistakenly conflate two distinct historical figures separated by approximately 1,500 years: Maryam, the sister of Moses and Aaron from the Old Testament, and Mary, the mother of Jesus from the New Testament. This article critically explores this conflation, analyzing its origins, textual evidence, and implications for Islamic theology and comparative scriptural studies.2. The Biblical Maryam and Mary: Historical ContextIn the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh),Miriam (Maryam)is introduced as the sister ofMoses (Moshe)andAaron (Aharon)(Exodus 15:20; Numbers 26:59). She was a prophetess and a significant figure during the Israelites’ exodus from Egypt, living approximately1500 years before the birth of Jesus Christ.Conversely,Mary (Greek: Μαρία, Hebrew: מִרְיָם), the mother of Jesus, appears in the New Testament as a young Jewish woman of Nazareth, espoused to Joseph, and chosen by God to bear the Messiah (Luke 1:26–38). The genealogies in Matthew 1 and Luke 3 situate Mary in the lineage of David, centuries after the era of Moses and Aaron.Thus, from a historical and genealogical perspective, these two women belong to vastly different eras and family lineages.3. The Qur’anic Narrative and the Genealogical ConfusionInSurah Maryam (Chapter 19), the Qur'an narrates the annunciation and virgin birth of Jesus, presenting Maryam as the daughter of Imran (Amram) and the sister of Aaron:“O sister of Aaron! Your father was not a man of evil, nor was your mother unchaste.”(Qur'an 19:28)Additionally, inSurah Al-Imran (Chapter 3), the Qur'an names Maryam’s father asImran:“[And mention] when the wife of Imran said, ‘My Lord, indeed I have pledged to You what is in my womb, consecrated [for Your service], so accept this from me.’”(Qur'an 3:35)In the Hebrew Bible,Amram (Arabic: Imran)is explicitly identified as the father ofMoses, Aaron, and Miriam(Numbers 26:59). The Qur'anic Mary, mother of Jesus, is thus genealogically identified as their sister, a chronological impossibility given the historical gap of over a millennium.4. Classical Muslim Exegesis and Apologetic ResponsesEarly Muslim commentators, such asIbn KathirandAl-Tabari, recognized this apparent anachronism. Several apologetic interpretations attempted to resolve the issue:Some argued that“sister of Aaron”was anhonorific title, reflecting piety rather than literal kinship.Others claimed thatMary’s brother was coincidentally named Aaron, a figure otherwise absent from credible historical records.Another explanation suggested that the family of Mary bore the ancestral title“House of Imran”as a symbol of spiritual heritage.However, these interpretations lack textual and historical corroboration in either Jewish or Christian traditions and appear as retrospective justifications rather than evidence-based clarifications.5. The Theological and Historical ImplicationsThis conflation is significant because it directly challenges thehistorical reliability of the Qur'anic textand its claimed divine inerrancy. Thegenealogical misplacementnot only distorts biblical history but also introduces inconsistencies in the Qur’anic narrative structure:It undermines the Qur'an’s assertion of confirming previous scriptures (Qur'an 5:48).It reveals a reliance onapocryphal Christian sourcesand oral traditions that were circulating in Arabia during Muhammad’s time, which may have contained confused or legendary material.It calls into question the claim of the Qur’an being aclear, preserved, and perfect revelationfree from error.This discrepancy provides critical grounds for comparative theological discussions onthe integrity of religious textsand the processes ofscriptural transmission.6. Comparative Scriptural Integrity: Bible vs. Qur’anTheBible, despite undergoing extensive textual criticism, maintains clear historical distinctions between its characters. Miriam, the sister of Moses and Aaron, is consistently situated in the Exodus narrative, while Mary, mother of Jesus, belongs to the first-century Roman Judea context. The genealogies in Matthew 1 and Luke 3 affirm this chronological separation.By contrast, the Qur'anic confusion points to thelimitations of oral transmissionand reliance onsecondary sourcesin early Islamic tradition, contrary to its claims of divine preservation and textual perfection (Qur'an 15:9).7. ConclusionThe Qur'anic conflation ofMaryam, sister of Aaron, andMary, the mother of Jesus, represents a critical historical and genealogical error with profound implications for thecredibility of the Qur'anic text. While Islamic apologetics has sought to explain away the inconsistency through honorific and symbolic interpretations, these remain unsubstantiated by historical evidence. This study underscores the necessity for rigorous historical-critical methodology in examining religious texts and encourages open interfaith dialogue on scriptural authenticity.ReferencesThe Holy Qur’an, trans.

    "full_content": "The Term “God” in Arabic isIlāh: A Scholarly Examination of the Shahada, Qur’anic Text, and Theological ImplicationsBy Max ShimbaAbstractThis article investigates the linguistic and theological distinctions between the Arabic termsilāh(god) andAllāh(Allah) within the context of Islamic doctrine, particularly the Shahada (Islamic declaration of faith). Drawing from the Qur’an, authoritative hadith, and academic sources, it examines how these terms are used and their implications for interfaith discourse.1. IntroductionIn Islamic theology, theShahada—“Lā ilāha illā Allāh Muhammadur Rasūl Allāh”—is central, representing the cornerstone of Muslim belief. It can be found explicitly in the Qur’an (e.g., 3:18), as well as in canonical hadith collections such asSahih al-Bukhari(Vol. 4, Book 56, No. 725). The meaning and translation of key terms within the Shahada are crucial to understanding Islamic monotheism and its distinction from other faiths.2. Linguistic Analysis of the ShahadaThe Arabic phraselā ilāha illā Allāhcan be broken down as follows:lā(لا): “There is no,” “not,” “none” (Wehr, 1976).ilāha(إِلَـٰهَ): “god,” “deity,” “object of worship.” This is a generic noun (Lane, 1863).illā(إِلَّا): “except,” “but.” A contraction ofin-lā(Wehr, 1976).Allāh(اللّٰه): Proper noun; the unique name for the one God in Islam. Not translated; considered linguistically and theologically unique (Peters, 2003).Thus, the phrase translates as:“There is no god except Allah.”3. Academic and Lexical Sources3.1. Lexicographical EvidenceHans Wehr, “A Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic” (1976):Definesilāhas “a god, deity, object of worship.”Edward William Lane, “An Arabic-English Lexicon” (1863):Notesilāhas a generic term, whileAllāhis used exclusively for the God of Islam.Al-Tafsir.com(Saudi Government’s Official Portal): Confirms thatilāhis generic, whileAllāhis not translated and has no equivalent in other languages.3.2. Theological and Qur’anic ContextThe Qur’an 3:18:“Allah bears witness that there is no deity except Him…” (Sahih International translation).Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 4, Book 56, Hadith 725:Records the Shahada and its significance in Islamic faith.Tafsir al-Jalalayn:Explains thatilāhdenotes any object of worship, butAllāhis unique and incomparable.4. Theological Implications4.1. The Uniqueness of AllahThe Qur’an states in Surah al-Ikhlas (112:4): “And there is none comparable to Him.” Islamic theology maintains thatAllāhis sui generis, without partner, equal, or likeness (Nasr, 2003). To equate Allah with deities of other religions—such as the Christian concept of God, Buddha, or traditional African gods—contradicts Islamic monotheism (tawhid).4.2. Polemics and Interfaith DiscourseThe issue of translatingAllāhas “God” in other languages is a subject of ongoing theological debate (see Reynolds, 2010; Peters, 2003). While Arabic-speaking Christians may use “Allah” for God, Islamic doctrine maintains a theological distinction:ilāhcan refer to any deity, whileAllāhrefers uniquely to the one God of Islam.5. ConclusionA careful analysis of the Shahada and relevant Arabic terms demonstrates a clear distinction:ilāh= a generic term for “god” or “deity”Allāh= the unique, untranslatable proper name for the God of IslamTherefore, the assertion that “Allah is not simply ‘God’” but is uniquely identified in Islamic theology is well-supported by both textual and academic evidence.6.

A true Christian does not return to religious debates with pagans, who are among the Antichrists known as Muslims. This is a scriptural investigation comparing the message of the Holy Qur’an and the Holy Bible, from someone who lived in a mosque and by God’s grace came to know the truth. Welcome, and we wish you fruitful reading.BEGINNINGWe greet you again in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Once more, our God, whose name is YEHOVAH, has granted us grace to share these words of life—the TRUTH OF THE WORD OF GOD, THE BIBLE.First, I wish to clarify that this platform is not for religious purposes, but to sound the trumpet so that the unique and true children of God can flee from worship contrary to God’s will.We do not care what religion, nation, or language you are from; our aim is to examine the Holy Scriptures and uncover their truth.May the Lord bless you as you seek the truth.DO CHRISTIANS AND MUSLIMS WALK THE SAME PATH?Amos 3:3Can two walk together, unless they are agreed?Even a five-year-old child could answer NO!Reason No.1: THEY ARE A RELIGION, WE ARE THE CHURCHIslamic Reference:Qur’an 5:2–3 (Surat al-Ma’ida):\"O you who have believed, do not violate the rites of Allah or the sacred month or the sacrificial animals or the garlands or those coming to the Sacred House seeking bounty from their Lord and [His] pleasure... This day I have perfected for you your religion and completed My favor upon you and have approved for you Islam as religion...\"Qur’an 4:171 (Surat An-Nisa):\"O People of the Scripture, do not commit excess in your religion or say about Allah except the truth...\"Biblical Reference:Matthew 16:16, 18:Simon Peter answered, 'You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.' Jesus replied... 'On this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it.'Acts 2:41, 47:Those who accepted his message were baptized, and about three thousand were added to their number that day... And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.1 Corinthians 3:23:And you are Christ’s, and Christ is God’s.Acts 11:26:...The disciples were called Christians first at Antioch.Reason No.2: THE ONE TRUE GODMuslim preachers often compare Qur’anic and Biblical verses to claim that Allah is the same as Jehovah. Let us examine both the Qur’an and the Bible to see if this claim holds.Exodus 20:1–3:And God spoke all these words, saying, “I am the LORD your God... You shall have no other gods before Me.”The warning means there are other “gods” worshipped by people. The Hebrew “Elohim” and Greek “Theos” appear thousands of times in the Bible, but there are also mentions of false gods:Dagon(Judges 16:23)Baal(1 Kings 18:21)Artemis(Acts 19:24–28)Similarly, the Qur’an refers to other gods worshipped in Mecca:Qur’an 53:19–23 (Surat An-Najm):Have you considered al-Lat and al-‘Uzza and Manat, the third, the other one? ...These are nothing but names you have named, you and your fathers...Thus, different gods are worshipped by different groups. The prophets served Jehovah, but Muhammad worshipped Allah. Is Allah the same as Jehovah?Deuteronomy 6:4:Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one.Isaiah 45:18, 21:...I am the LORD, and there is no other.Psalm 86:10:For you are great and do marvelous deeds; you alone are God.John 17:3:Now this is eternal life: that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.1 Corinthians 8:4:...There is no God but one.Reason No.3: ALLAH IS NOT JEHOVAH GODQur’an 15:30–39 (Surat al-Hijr):Describes the story of Iblis refusing to bow to Adam and Allah granting him respite until the Day of Resurrection.Qur’an 51:56 (Surat adh-Dhariyat):I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me.Reason No.4: ALLAH SWEARS BY HIS CREATION, JEHOVAH DOES NOTQur’an 92:1–3 (Surat Al-Layl):By the night as it envelops and by the day as it appears...Qur’an 91:1–7 (Surat Ash-Shams):By the sun and its brightness... By the soul and Him who proportioned it...Yet, Jehovah does not swear by creation:Isaiah 44:24:I am the LORD, who has made all things, who alone stretched out the heavens, who spread out the earth by myself.Isaiah 45:22–23:...For I am God, and there is no other. By myself I have sworn...Hebrews 6:13:For when God made a promise to Abraham, because He could swear by no one greater, He swore by Himself...Jehovah swears by Himself, never by creation.Reason No.5: THEIR GOD DENIES JESUS CHRISTQur’an 19:35 (Surat Maryam):It is not befitting for Allah to take a son; exalted is He!Qur’an 112:1–4 (Surat Al-Ikhlas):He begets not, nor is He begotten...The Bible teaches:1 John 2:22–26:Who is the liar? It is whoever denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a person is the antichrist—denying the Father and the Son...Colossians 1:13–15:He has rescued us from the dominion of darkness... The Son is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation.John 3:16–17:For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son...Reason No.6: GOD’S NAMEQur’an 17:110 (Surat Al-Isra):Say, “Call upon Allah or call upon the Most Merciful. Whichever [name] you call—to Him belong the best names...”The name Allah appears 2,866 times in the Qur’an, but the Bible reveals God’s name as Jehovah:Exodus 6:2–3:God spoke to Moses and said, “I am the LORD [YHWH]... I appeared to Abraham... as God Almighty, but by my name Jehovah I was not known to them.”Psalm 83:18:That men may know that You, whose name alone is the LORD [YHWH], are the Most High over all the earth.NB: “God” is a title, not a personal name.Reason No.7: THE MESSAGE IS DIFFERENTWhile Islamic apologists claim the prophets taught the same message as Muhammad, the evidence is otherwise:Qur’an 41:6 (Surat Fussilat):Say, “I am only a man like you, to whom it has been revealed that your god is one God...”Qur’an 29:46–47 (Surat Al-Ankabut):...Our God and your God is one; and to Him we submit.However, the Bible teaches distinct revelation through Jesus Christ and the apostolic church.Reason No.8: ANGELS—GABRIEL OR MICHAEL?Islam claims Gabriel (Jibril) is the chief angel:Qur’an 81:19–21 (Surat At-Takwir):Indeed, the Qur’an is the word of a noble messenger [Jibril], having power and with the Owner of the Throne, secure [in position]...The Bible presents Michael as the chief angel:Jude 1:9:But even the archangel Michael... said, “The Lord rebuke you!”Therefore, the chief angels differ.Reason No.9: THE CHOSEN CITY—MECCA OR JERUSALEM?Qur’an 27:91 (Surat An-Naml):I am commanded only to worship the Lord of this city [Mecca]...Qur’an 3:96 (Surat Al-Imran):Indeed, the first House [of worship] established for mankind was that at Mecca...Jehovah chose Jerusalem:2 Chronicles 6:4–6:...But I have chosen Jerusalem for my Name to be there...Reason No.10: PURITY AND HOLINESSQur’an 53:32 (Surat An-Najm):...So do not claim yourselves to be pure. He is most knowing of who fears Him.Qur’an 12:53 (Surat Yusuf):And I do not acquit myself. Indeed, the soul is a persistent enjoiner of evil...Jehovah commands His people to be holy:Isaiah 43:3:For I am the LORD your God, the Holy One of Israel...Leviticus 11:44:Consecrate yourselves therefore, and be holy, for I am holy...1 Peter 1:15–16:Be holy, because I am holy.Reason No.11: PARADISE—ISLAMIC OR CHRISTIAN?Luke 20:34–36:The people of this age marry and are given in marriage. But those who are considered worthy... will neither marry nor be given in marriage...Islamic Paradise (Jannah) is described as a place of physical pleasures:Qur’an 39:20:But those who fear their Lord will have chambers, above them chambers built high...Qur’an 47:15:The description of Paradise... rivers of water... milk... wine... honey... and therein are for them purified spouses...Sunan Ibn Majah, vol. 5, p. 546, Hadith 4337:Each man will marry seventy-two wives in Paradise...Christian heaven, in contrast, is spiritual (Romans 14:17; Revelation 7:16–17).Reason No.12: THE FINAL DESTINY OF ALLAH AND HIS FOLLOWERSQur’an 51:56:And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me.Qur’an 6:128:The Fire is your residence, wherein you will abide eternally...Sahih al-Bukhari, vol. 6, hadith 371, p. 353:Allah will place His foot in Hell and it will say “Enough! Enough!”Biblical teaching is different:Matthew 25:41, 46; Revelation 20:10, 21:8:The lake of fire is prepared for the devil and his angels, and the wicked will be eternally separated from God.ConclusionIt is evident from the Qur’an, Bible, and Islamic Hadith that Allah, worshipped by Muslims, isnotthe same as Jehovah, the God worshipped by Christians. If you, as a Muslim, realize this truth, I urge you by the grace of Christ to receive Jesus into your life and escape the worship of Satan, saving your soul from eternal death.Welcome to Jesus Christ our Lord.Revelation 3:20:Here I am!

    "full_content": "Islam and the Gospel: An Academic Exposé of Theological ContradictionBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThe relationship between Islam and Christianity, especially in their foundational texts, is marked by profound doctrinal divergence. While both faiths invoke Abrahamic heritage and affirm certain shared figures, the Quran's portrayal of Jesus Christ, Christian doctrine, and Christian believers is not merely different—it is fundamentally antagonistic to the heart of the Gospel. This article systematically examines Quranic statements about Jesus and Christians, demonstrates their incompatibility with Christian revelation, and exposes the Quran’s polemical agenda as irreconcilable with the New Testament message of redemption.IntroductionSince the advent of Islam in the 7th century, Muslims have asserted continuity with the Biblical tradition. However, the Quran repeatedly contradicts the central claims of Christianity. This article examines the most significant of these contradictions, analyzes their theological import, and shows that, contrary to the claims of Islamic apologetics, the Quran does not affirm the Gospel but rather sets itself in opposition to its most foundational truths.1. The Crucifixion of Jesus: History and Revelation DeniedQuranic Claim\"And [for] their saying, 'Indeed, we have killed the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, the messenger of Allah.' And they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him; but [another] was made to resemble him to them.\"Quran 4:157Christian TeachingThe crucifixion of Jesus Christ is the historical and theological core of the Gospel:“For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures.”(1 Corinthians 15:3)All four Gospels (Matthew 27, Mark 15, Luke 23, John 19) attest to the crucifixion, as does the testimony of secular historians such as Tacitus and Josephus.AnalysisThe Quranic denial of the crucifixion constitutes a repudiation of the Gospel itself. The Christian doctrine of atonement—Jesus' sacrificial death for sin—is not an optional belief, but “of first importance.”If Christ was not crucified, there is no salvation, no resurrection, and no Christianity (see 1 Corinthians 15:17).Scholarly ConsensusHistorians, both secular and religious, agree on the historical certainty of Jesus’ crucifixion. Noted historian Bart Ehrman writes:“One of the most certain facts of history is that Jesus was crucified on orders of the Roman prefect Pontius Pilate.”The Quran’s denial is a unique and much later claim, unsupported by historical evidence.2. The Identity of Jesus: Muslim Prophet or Divine Savior?Quranic Claim“But when Jesus felt [persistence in] disbelief from them, he said, 'Who are my supporters for [the cause of] Allah?' The disciples said, 'We are supporters for Allah. We have believed in Allah and testify that we are Muslims [submitting to Him].’”Quran 3:52Christian TeachingJesus never called himself a Muslim. The Gospel records Jesus as the unique Son of God (John 3:16), the Word made flesh (John 1:14), and the only Savior of mankind (Acts 4:12).AnalysisTo retroactively call Jesus and his disciples “Muslims” is anachronistic and historically untenable. It is an attempt by the Quran to subsume Christian revelation into a new, incompatible framework.3. The Quran’s View of Christians: Condemnation and HostilityChristians Are DeludedQuran 9:30: \"The Christians say, 'The Messiah is the son of Allah.' That is their statement from their mouths; they imitate the saying of those who disbelieved [before them]. May Allah destroy them; how are they deluded?\"Christians Lie About GodQuran 10:68: \"They have said, 'Allah has taken a son.' Exalted is He; He is the [one] Free of need. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. You have no authority for this [claim]. Do you say about Allah that which you do not know?\"Christians Are Disbelievers, Destined for HellQuran 5:72: \"They have certainly disbelieved who say, 'Allah is the Messiah, the son of Mary'... the Fire will be his refuge.\"Christians Should Be Fought and SubjugatedQuran 9:29: \"Fight those who do not believe in Allah...among the People of the Book...until they give the jizya [tax] willingly while they are humbled.\"Christians Are EnemiesQuran 5:51: \"O you who have believed, do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies...they are [in fact] allies of one another. And whoever is an ally to them among you—then indeed, he is [one] of them.\"Christians Worship Mary and JesusQuran 5:116: \"[And beware the Day] when Allah will say, 'O Jesus, Son of Mary, did you say to the people, \"Take me and my mother as deities besides Allah?\"'\"4. Contradiction with the Gospel of Jesus ChristThe Gospel’s TeachingThe New Testament presents a radically different message:Salvation is through Christ alone(John 14:6; Acts 4:12).God is loveand desires all to be saved (1 Timothy 2:4; John 3:16).Christians are called to love, not to subjugate(Matthew 5:44).Jesus is the Son of God(Matthew 16:16–17; John 20:31).On the Deity of ChristThe Quran’s repeated denials of Christ’s Sonship and deity (e.g., 5:72; 9:30; 10:68) are not mere misunderstandings; they are explicit rejections of the apostolic proclamation (see 1 John 2:22–23).On Christian WorshipThe charge that Christians worship Mary is a straw man. Nowhere in the canonical Gospels or apostolic writings is Mary worshiped or elevated to divine status.Christian Trinitarian doctrine is monotheistic, affirming one God in three Persons—not the polytheism alleged by the Quran.5. Theological Consequences and Historical OutcomesThe Quran’s polemic against Christians results not only in theological separation but also in social and political animosity:The doctrine of fighting and subjugating Christians (Quran 9:29) became the basis for centuries of Islamic dhimmitude, whereby Christians in Muslim lands were made second-class citizens, subject to extra taxation and legal discrimination.The explicit injunction not to take Christians as friends or allies (Quran 5:51) institutionalizes hostility, contrary to the Gospel’s call for peace and reconciliation (Romans 12:18).6. Conclusion: The Incompatibility of Islam with the GospelIt is impossible, with academic and theological integrity, to affirm both the Quran and the Gospel.The Quran denies the crucifixion, the deity and Sonship of Jesus, and the very heart of the Christian message. It misrepresents Christian worship and openly declares Christians to be deluded, disbelievers, and enemies of God.Christians must recognize that Islam, as defined by its primary text, is not a friendly neighbor but a system of belief that stands in direct opposition to the saving truth of the Gospel.For the faithful follower of Jesus Christ, allegiance to the Gospel means exposing error and holding fast to the apostolic faith delivered once for all to the saints (Jude 3).ReferencesThe Holy Bible (ESV, NIV, KJV)The Quran (Sahih International Translation)Ehrman, Bart D.,Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New MillenniumCragg, Kenneth,The Call of the MinaretWood, David,The Quran vs. the Bible: A Critique of Islam’s Sacred TextsWhite, James R.,What Every Christian Needs to Know About the QuranMcDowell, Josh,The Resurrection FactorJosephus, Flavius,Antiquities of the JewsTacitus, Cornelius,AnnalsDr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

    "full_content": "Zul-Qarnain and the Setting of the Sun in Surah 18:85-86: An Academic AnalysisBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThe narrative of Zul-Qarnain and the setting of the sun as described in the Qur’an (Surah 18:85–86) has long been a subject of debate, especially regarding its compatibility with astronomical realities. This paper critically examines the literal meaning of the Qur’anic text, the historical context of its interpretation among early Muslims, and the responses by Muslim scholars to challenges raised by this passage.1. The Text of Surah 18:85-86Surah Al-Kahf (18:85-86) states (various translations):“So he followed a way. Until, when he reached the setting of the sun, he found it set in a spring of dark mud, and he found near it a people...”(Sahih International, 18:85-86)A straightforward reading seems to suggest that Zul-Qarnain witnessed the sun setting in a muddy or dark spring. This passage has been the subject of much theological, philosophical, and scientific scrutiny.2. Astronomy and the Early Islamic WorldIt is often overlooked that Abbasid-era Islamic rulers and scholars, both Arabs and Persians, made significant advancements in astronomy. They named many stars and corrected astronomical tables inherited from ancient Egyptians (such as Ptolemy’s tables). Nevertheless, modern astronomy is unequivocal: the sun is vastly larger than Earth, and Earth orbits the sun, not the other way around. The sun never physically “sets” in a spring of muddy water.3. Who Was Zul-Qarnain?The identity of Zul-Qarnain remains debated. Islamic sources offer four main theories:Alexander the Great: The majority opinion identifies Zul-Qarnain (“the one with two horns”) as Alexander the Great. There is an apocryphal legend that Alexander was a god who possessed two ram’s horns. This idea is not supported by historical facts, and the practical challenges (such as wearing a helmet with two horns) make this legend dubious. Nonetheless, many Muslims historically have believed that Surah 18 refers to Alexander.Cyrus I of Persia: Another theory suggests that Zul-Qarnain was Cyrus I, whose kingdom comprised two principal peoples, the Medes and the Persians. There is, however, little evidence connecting the “two horns” to him.A King of Yemen: Some traditions associate Zul-Qarnain with a Yemeni king who wore a helmet adorned with two ram’s horns.An Unknown Figure: Some scholars suggest Zul-Qarnain was simply an unknown person, but explanations involving unnamed historical figures risk incoherence.Conclusion:Ultimately, regardless of Zul-Qarnain’s identity, the narrative’s claim that the sun sets in a muddy spring contradicts established scientific knowledge.4. Interpretations and Muslim ResponsesView 1: Literal Interpretation – The Sun Sets in a Muddy SpringEarly Muslims, including the classical historian al-Tabari, understood the verse literally. Al-Tabari (d. 923 CE), for example, in hisHistory(Vol. 1, p. 234) states that Zul-Qarnain “witnessed the setting of the sun in its resting place, in a black, foul-smelling spring.” Similar interpretations appear throughout al-Tabari’s works (see also Vol. 5, pp. 173–174; Vol. 1, p. 371).Additionally, al-Tabari recounts that, according to ancient lore, the earth rests on a great fish (History, Vol. 1, p. 220), reflecting the mythological worldview that pervaded the ancient Near East.View 2: The Sun Seemed to Set in the Lake of Ithaca, MacedoniaSome have suggested that the verse refers to Alexander observing the sun setting over a lake in Macedonia (Ithaca). However, this is inconsistent with known Greek and Phoenician geography, since Greeks had colonies far west of Macedonia, including in Spain and Sicily, centuries before Alexander. Greek writers such as Aristotle mention explorers from Sardinia, which is much farther west. Thus, no educated Greek or Macedonian would have believed the sun literally set in Macedonia.View 3: “Spring of Muddy Water” Refers to the Atlantic OceanAnother interpretation is that the “spring” refers to the Atlantic Ocean. Yet the Atlantic is neither muddy nor black, but blue-green, and it is an ocean, not a spring. Alexander the Great, Cyrus I, and the Yemeni kings never reached the Atlantic’s edge, nor does the Qur’an mention such a journey.View 4: Refers to the Black SeaSome posit that the spring refers to the Black Sea. Yet, there is no evidence Cyrus I ever traveled to the regions east of the Black Sea. Additionally, the Black Sea is not a “spring,” and even ancient Egyptians and Greeks knew the sun did not set in the Black Sea.View 5: Refers to the Aegean SeaIf the reference were to the Aegean, Persians were well acquainted with Greeks across that sea, and would not have believed that the sun set there.View 6: Refers to the Red SeaIf the “spring” was the Red Sea, Yemenis (Sabaeans) were familiar with Abyssinians (Ethiopians) across the water, so the claim would again be implausible.View 7: Metaphorical InterpretationSome propose the description is metaphorical. However, the Qur’an does not indicate the story is allegorical or parabolic, and the earliest Muslim interpreters did not treat it as such. Therefore, if it was meant metaphorically, the Qur’an failed to clarify its figurative intent, misleading its audience.View 8: A Dream NarrativeOthers suggest Muhammad was narrating a dream or vision. However, neither the Qur’an nor early Islamic sources present the story as a vision or dream. If millions believe a passage is literal, but the author failed to clarify its true nature, this calls into question the reliability of the narrative.5. ConclusionRegardless of Zul-Qarnain’s identity—Alexander the Great, Cyrus I, or another—the Qur’an presents the sun as setting in a muddy spring as a literal occurrence. Even a millennium before Muhammad, educated people knew the sun does not set in Spain or any earthly body of water. Early Muslims, including the companions and successors of Muhammad, interpreted this passage literally.If Allah, the God of Islam, revealed this information, and it was factually incorrect, then this is a clear error. If, instead, the Qur’an was authored by Muhammad or his contemporaries, the mistake is explained by the worldview of the time. Alternatively, if the Qur’an’s God does not exist, then the question of error or deception is moot.References and BibliographyQur’an Translations and CommentariesArberry, Arthur J.The Koran Interpreted.

It interrogates the origin, lack of scriptural basis, and the critical stance of renowned Islamic scholars, arguing that the practice is an innovation (bid‘ah) rooted in pagan custom rather than Islamic revelation.1. The History of MawlidHistorical records indicate that neither the Prophet Muhammad nor his Companions celebrated the Mawlid. The earliest reports of the celebration emerge centuries after the Prophet's death, primarily among the Fatimid (Ismaili Shi‘a) dynasty in Egypt (Calvert, 2010; Schimmel, 1987).Al-Hafidh al-Sakhawi (d. 902 AH) records:“The celebration of the Mawlid was not practiced by the pious predecessors (Salaf al-Salih) of the first three generations. It was introduced after them.”(al-Sakhawi,Subul al-Huda wa al-Rashad, Vol. 1, p. 439)Al-Maqrizi (d. 845 AH) provides a historical account:“The Fatimid rulers inaugurated the Mawlid festival along with others, such as Mawlid of ‘Ali, Fatima, Hasan, Husayn, and their living Imam, as well as other seasonal festivals.”(al-Maqrizi,al-Khitat, Vol. 1, p. 490)Further, Shaykh ‘Ali Mahfudh notes:“The first to introduce Mawlid in Cairo were the Fatimid rulers in the 4th century AH. They created six Mawlids.”(Mahfudh,al-Ibda‘ fi Madhahir al-Ibtida‘, p. 251)Sunni AdoptionSheikh Abdulla Saleh Farsy states:“The first official Mawlid recited by Sunnis was organized by King Mudhaffar ad-Din in northern Iraq, a brother-in-law to Sultan Salahuddin al-Ayyubi. This event was unprecedented in size and splendor.”(Farsy,Tafsiri ya Mawlid Barzanji, p. iv)2. Absence of Scriptural EvidenceThere is no authentic evidence from the Quran or the sahih hadith specifying the exact date of the Prophet's birth or instructing Muslims to commemorate it.Safi-ur-Rahman Mubarakpuri writes:“Muhammad… was born on Monday, 9th Rabi‘ al-Awwal, in the Year of the Elephant… corresponding to April 20 or 22, 571 CE.”(Mubarakpuri,Ar-Raheeq al-Makhtum, p. 62)Sirajur Rahman adds:“The event of the Elephant occurred in Muharram, fifty-five days before the Prophet’s birth, suggesting the birth fell between 25th Safar and 25th Rabi‘ al-Awwal.”(Rahman,Al-Mustafa, p. 11)The Quran remains silent on the Prophet’s exact birth date and does not prescribe any celebration of his birth (Nasr, 2003).3. Scholarly Critique and the Question of Innovation (Bid‘ah)Notable classical and contemporary scholars have denounced the Mawlid as an innovation with pagan undertones:Imam al-Shatibi (d. 790 AH): Criticized the Mawlid as an innovation in his magnum opus.(al-Shatibi,al-I‘tisam, Vol. 1, p. 34)Imam al-Fakihani (d. 734 AH): Authored a treatise refuting the legitimacy of Mawlid.(al-Fakihani,Risalah fi Mawlid al-Nabi)Imam Ibn al-Hajj al-Maliki (d. 737 AH): Explicitly categorized Mawlid as bid‘ah.(Ibn al-Hajj,al-Madkhal, Vol. 2, pp. 11–12)Abu ‘Abdillah al-Haffar al-Maliki: Asserted the absence of Mawlid celebration among the Prophet’s Companions or their successors.(al-Haffar,al-Mi‘yar al-Mu‘rab, Vol. 7, p. 99)Abu At-Tayyib Shams al-Haq al-‘Aẓimabadiand his teacher Bashiruddin Qannuji authored a monograph refuting the practice.(Qannuji,Ghayat al-Kalam fi Ibtal Amal al-Mawlid wal-Qiyam)The Prophet himself is reported to have said:“Whoever introduces into our religion that which is not from it, it will be rejected.”(Sahih al-Bukhari, Hadith 2697; Sahih Muslim, Hadith 1718)Key Questions for ReflectionWhere in the Quran are Muslims instructed or permitted to celebrate the Mawlid?Where in the Quran is the birth or lifespan of Muhammad mentioned in detail?Why do Muslims celebrate the Mawlid when it is absent from the Quran and authentic hadith?Who is the ultimate authority for Muslims: Allah, Muhammad, the Quran, authentic hadith, or established schools of law?Referencesal-Fakihani, Abu’l-‘Abbas Ahmad.Risalah fi Mawlid al-Nabi(Treatise on the Prophet’s Birthday).al-Haffar, Abu ‘Abdillah.al-Mi‘yar al-Mu‘rab.al-Khatib al-Baghdadi, Abu Bakr Ahmad.Tariq Baghdad.al-Maqrizi, Taqi al-Din Ahmad.al-Khitat(The Plans), Vol. 1, Cairo, 1999.al-Mubarakpuri, Safi-ur-Rahman.Ar-Raheeq al-Makhtum(The Sealed Nectar), Darussalam, 2002.al-Sakhawi, Shams al-Din Muhammad.Subul al-Huda wa al-Rashad, Vol. 1.al-Shatibi, Abu Ishaq.al-I‘tisam, Vol. 1, Beirut: Dar Ibn ‘Affan, 1997.Farsy, Abdulla Saleh.Tafsiri ya Mawlid Barzanji, Zanzibar.Ibn al-Hajj al-Maliki, Muhammad.al-Madkhal, Vol. 2, Beirut: Dar al-Kutub al-‘Ilmiyyah, 1981.Mahfudh, ‘Ali.al-Ibda‘ fi Madhahir al-Ibtida‘, Cairo, 1970.Mubarakpuri, Safi-ur-Rahman.Ar-Raheeq al-Makhtum(The Sealed Nectar), Darussalam, 2002.Nasr, Seyyed Hossein, et al.The Study Quran, HarperOne, 2015.Qannuji, Bashiruddin.Ghayat al-Kalam fi Ibtal Amal al-Mawlid wal-Qiyam.Rahman, Sirajur.Al-Mustafa, Ansaar Muslim Youth Organisation, 1993.Schimmel, Annemarie.And Muhammad is His Messenger: The Veneration of the Prophet in Islamic Piety, University of North Carolina Press, 1987.Calvert, John.Sayyid Qutb and the Origins of Radical Islamism, Columbia University Press, 2010.Qur’an: Various translations, e.g., M.A.S.

    "full_content": "Muhammad’s Attitude Towards Children: A Critical Scholarly ExaminationBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Servant of Jesus Christwww.maxshimbaministries.orgIntroductionThe subject of religious leadership and moral conduct, particularly in relation to the treatment of children, remains central to interfaith dialogue and the comparative study of world religions. This paper critically examines the character and actions of the Prophet Muhammad, as depicted in Islamic primary sources, in relation to children. It juxtaposes these findings with the teachings and actions of Jesus Christ, as recorded in the New Testament. The analysis intends to offer a clear perspective for those seeking to understand the ethical frameworks within which these two prominent religious figures operated.1. Muhammad’s Stance on the Killing of Children: A Hadith AnalysisA significant moral and theological concern arises from narrations regarding the conduct of Muhammad in the context of warfare and the treatment of non-combatants, particularly women and children. InSahih Muslim, one of the most authoritative collections of Hadith, Sa'b b. Jaththama reports:\"The Prophet of Allah (peace be upon him) was asked about the women and children of polytheists being killed during the night raids. He said: 'They are from them (i.e., they are part of them).'\"(Sahih Muslim, Hadith 4322; see also Sahih Bukhari 52:256)This narration indicates a disturbing moral ambiguity regarding the permissibility of collateral damage involving children in armed conflict, a position seemingly at odds with modern concepts of human rights and the protection of innocents during war (see: Peters, R. (1996). Jihad in Classical and Modern Islam. Princeton: Markus Wiener Publishers).The Execution of Singing GirlsFollowing the conquest of Mecca, sources in early Islamic historiography report that Muhammad ordered the execution of two female singers, Fartana and her companion, for satirizing him in song:\"The two singing-girls, Fartana and her friend, used to sing satirical verses about the Messenger of Allah. The Prophet ordered that they be put to death, and they were executed.\"(Ibn Ishaq,Sirat Rasul Allah, ed. A. Guillaume, p. 819)This episode is recorded in the earliest and most respected biography of Muhammad, and it highlights the grave consequences faced by even young women and girls who fell afoul of the Prophet's authority (see: Ibn Ishaq/Hisham 819; also referenced in al-Tabari,The History of al-Tabari, Vol. 8).2. Muhammad’s Marriage to Aisha: Historical Context and Ethical ConsiderationsAmong the most contentious aspects of Muhammad’s biography is his marriage to Aisha, which, according to several Hadith sources, occurred when she was very young:\"Aisha reported: The Prophet married me when I was six years old, and consummated the marriage with me when I was nine years old.\"(Sahih Muslim 3310; Sahih al-Bukhari 5133, 5134, 5135, 5158; Sunan Abu Dawud 2116)Aisha herself is quoted as saying:\"The Prophet married me when I was six years old, and had sexual intercourse with me when I was nine years old.\"(Sunan Abu Dawud 2116)Scholarly debate continues regarding the historical and cultural context of this marriage. However, contemporary ethical standards, informed by modern understandings of child development and consent, regard such actions as morally indefensible and legally criminal (see: Spencer, R. (2006). The Truth About Muhammad. Regnery Publishing; Barlas, A. (2002). \"Believing Women\" in Islam: Unreading Patriarchal Interpretations of the Qur'an. University of Texas Press).3. The Teachings of Jesus Concerning ChildrenBy contrast, the Gospels portray Jesus Christ as embodying a profoundly compassionate attitude toward children, emphasizing their inherent dignity and spiritual significance:\"Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.\"(Matthew 19:14; cf. Matthew 18:1-4; Mark 9:33-37; Mark 10:13-16)Jesus not only welcomed children but also used their example to illustrate the humility and purity required to enter the Kingdom of God. He publicly blessed children and affirmed their place in the community of believers (see: France, R. T. (2007). The Gospel of Matthew. Eerdmans; Nolland, J. (2005). The Gospel of Matthew: A Commentary on the Greek Text. Eerdmans).4. Comparative Ethical ReflectionFrom an ethical and theological standpoint, the contrast is stark:Muhammadis depicted in Islamic tradition as permitting or at least not preventing the killing of children in war and entering into a marital relationship with a prepubescent girl.Jesus, in the Christian tradition, is portrayed as a protector and lover of children, elevating them as exemplars of the qualities needed for entry into God’s kingdom.Such divergent portraits compel the conscientious seeker to critically evaluate which model truly embodies the spirit of divine love and moral uprightness. The choice between following a figure who, according to some sources, permitted harm to children, or one who cherished and blessed them, is ultimately a personal and spiritual decision.Conclusion: A Call for Moral DiscernmentIn light of these historical and scriptural records, I urge readers to examine the evidence thoughtfully. Consider whether Muhammad’s actions align with the standards of prophetic conduct expected of a messenger of God, or whether the example of Jesus, who loved and blessed children, represents the higher ethical path.The choice is yours:To follow Muhammad, who, according to these sources, permitted the killing and sexual exploitation of children,orTo follow Jesus, who loved, blessed, and welcomed children into the Kingdom of Heaven.Yours sincerely,Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Servant of Jesus Christwww.maxshimbaministries.orgReferencesSahih Muslim, Book 19, Hadith 4322; also Sahih Bukhari 52:256.Ibn Ishaq,Sirat Rasul Allah, ed.

Rooted in the earliest Islamic sources, the narrative claims that the Prophet Muhammad, at one point, recited verses in honor of pre-Islamic deities, which were subsequently abrogated and denounced as satanic interference. This article critically examines the historical evidence for the event, the textual variations in the Qur’an, early Islamic responses, and theological implications for the doctrines of revelation and scriptural integrity. Through the analysis of primary Islamic sources—biographies, hadith collections, and exegetical literature—this study contributes to the ongoing discourse on the transmission and preservation of sacred texts in Abrahamic religions.KeywordsQur’an, Satanic Verses, Muhammad, textual criticism, Islamic tradition, abrogation, scriptural integrity, polemics, revelation, early Islam.1. IntroductionWithin Islamic polemics and apologetics, the question of the reliability and preservation of holy scriptures remains central. Muslims often assert the divine preservation of the Qur’an, contrasting it with alleged textual corruption in the Bible. Yet, a critical review of Islamic historiography reveals episodes—such as the so-called “Satanic Verses”—that challenge simplistic notions of textual purity. This article investigates the “Satanic Verses” narrative, its documentation in Islamic sources, and its wider doctrinal consequences.2. Background: The Satanic Verses NarrativeThe term “Satanic Verses” refers to an incident recounted by numerous early Muslim authorities, wherein Satan is said to have inspired the Prophet Muhammad to utter verses affirming the intercessory power of three pre-Islamic goddesses: al-Lat, al-Uzza, and Manat. These verses were later abrogated and replaced within the Qur’anic corpus. The narrative, while highly contentious in Islamic thought, remains extensively documented in Islamic historical literature.3. Primary Sources and Early Islamic Historiography3.1 Qur’anic ContextSurah An-Najm (53:19–20)states:“Have you considered al-Lat and al-‘Uzza, and another, the third [goddess], Manat?”1Historical biographers recount that this passage was originally followed by a now-excised verse:“These are the exalted cranes (gharāniq), whose intercession is to be hoped for.”2This interpolation was later condemned as a product of satanic interference and removed, replaced with the current verses (53:21–22):“Is the male for you and the female for Him? That, then, is an unjust division.”3.2 Early Islamic BiographersFour principal early Muslim biographers preserve the episode:al-Wahidi / al-Waqidi (d. 207/823 CE):InAsbab al-Nuzul, describes how Muhammad’s conciliatory recitation led to the Meccan leaders’ approval, until Gabriel later rebuked him for reciting words not divinely revealed.3Ibn Sa’d (d. 230/845 CE):InKitab al-Tabaqat al-Kabir, corroborates the occurrence and details communal reactions.4Ibn Ishaq (d. 145/767 CE):InSirat Rasul Allah, reports that both Muslims and polytheists were momentarily reconciled by the verses, only for Muhammad to later retract them as satanic suggestion.5al-Tabari (d. 923 CE):InTarikh al-Rusul wa al-Muluk, provides a detailed account of Muhammad’s inner conflict, Satan’s intervention, and Gabriel’s subsequent correction.63.3 Other AcknowledgementsSeveral other prominent scholars and exegetes—including Abu Ma’shar, Ibn Abi Hatim, Ibn al-Mundhir, Ibn Hajar, Ibn Mardawayh, Musa ibn ‘Uqba, and Zamakhshari—reference or discuss the incident, indicating its prevalence in the early Islamic tradition.74. Indirect Evidence: Qur’an and Hadith4.1. Canonical HadithSahih al-BukhariandAbu Dawuddocument that, after Muhammad’s recitation of Surah An-Najm, both Muslims and pagans prostrated—a unique occurrence, suggesting the inclusion of conciliatory content.84.2. The Qur’an on Satanic InterferenceTwo passages are cited as allusions to this episode:Surah 22:52: “We did not send before you any messenger or prophet except that, when he desired, Satan threw [some suggestion] into his desire; but Allah abolishes that which Satan throws in, then Allah makes precise His verses...”Surah 17:73–75: Addresses external attempts to sway Muhammad from divine revelation, with warnings of grave consequences.5. Muslim Responses and Scholarly Critique5.1. Common Muslim ObjectionsLack of unanimity in the isnad (transmission chain):Some hadith collectors omit the incident, or question its reliability.Contradiction with Qur’anic monotheism and Muhammad’s inerrancy:Verses such as 15:9 and 41:42 are cited as evidence for the Qur’an’s incorruptibility.Redaction in Islamic sources:Later redactors like Ibn Hisham are known to have removed the episode from earlier biographies out of theological discomfort.95.2. Academic ResponsesScholarly consensus recognizes the multiplicity of independent early attestations, the early dating of the reports (predating major Sunni hadith collections), and the narrative’s consistency across biographical and exegetical sources. The practice of abrogation (naskh) within the Qur’an further supports the possibility of excised revelations.106. Theological and Scriptural ImplicationsThe Satanic Verses episode, if accepted, raises questions regarding the doctrine of revelation, prophetic impeccability (isma), and the Qur’an’s textual preservation. If Muhammad could temporarily utter non-divine words as revelation, it suggests a more dynamic—and vulnerable—process of scriptural transmission than traditional Islamic dogma permits.Conversely, if the incident is rejected, one must explain the widespread early Muslim attestation and the textual traces in both Qur’anic and hadith literature.The episode further intersects with the broader polemic between Islam and Christianity regarding the reliability and corruption of sacred texts, highlighting both shared anxieties and divergent doctrines of scriptural integrity.7. ConclusionThe “Satanic Verses” incident, deeply embedded in early Islamic literature, presents a significant case study in the history of religions. It compels both Muslims and non-Muslims to reckon with the realities of textual transmission, historical memory, and the complex evolution of doctrinal orthodoxy. Ultimately, the episode invites renewed reflection on the nature of divine communication, the limits of human agency in revelation, and the enduring quest for religious certainty.ReferencesCorrespondence:[Author Name], [Affiliation], [Email]Acknowledgments:The author thanks the staff at Max Shimba Ministries and the editorial board of theJournal of Comparative Religious Studiesfor their input.For further reading:www.MuslimHope.comwww.maxshimbaministries.orgThis article is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.If you need further customization (citations, additional sections, author bio, journal formatting, etc.), let me know your academic/religious field and target journal style!FootnotesQur’an 53:19–20.↩Guillaume, A.

Patristic Commentary: The Early Church on Prophets, Law, and Novel Revelation8.1. Early Christian Attitudes Toward Prophetic Successiona) Irenaeus of Lyons (c. 130–202 CE)InAgainst Heresies(Book IV, ch. 33), Irenaeus emphasizes theunity and consistency of God’s revelation:“The law and the prophets and the evangelists and the apostles…proclaimed one and the same God, perfect, just, and good.”Irenaeus repeatedly asserts thattrue prophetsconfirm and do not contradict the Torah:“The coming of the Son of God was prepared by the Law and the Prophets.”b) Tertullian (c. 155–240 CE)InPrescription Against Heretics(ch. 6–7), Tertullian warned:“No man is wise, no man is holy, except the man who is a disciple of the Law and the Prophets.”Tertullian sees any later prophet or teacher who seeks to “introduce another rule of faith” as ahereticand a corrupter of God’s original message.c) Origen (c. 184–253 CE)In hisContra Celsum(Book V), Origen defends thecontinuity and completeness of Mosaic revelation, insisting that all new claims must be measured by the “pattern given in the Law and Prophets.”d) John of Damascus (c. 676–749 CE)InFount of Knowledge(Book II: Heresies), John of Damascus, who lived after the rise of Islam, directly addressed Muhammad, calling him “the false prophet” who “having no miracles to show for himself, says that God gave him this written book [the Qur’an].”John accuses Muhammad of introducing doctrines “in direct contradiction to the Law and the Prophets,” and saw Islam as a post-Christian heresy, judged by the standards of biblical revelation.8.2. Patristic SummaryTheChurch Fathers—unanimous in their respect for the Mosaic Law—set a hermeneutical rule:Any prophet or teacher whose doctrine contradicts, adds to, or subtracts from the Mosaic Law is to be rejected.For them, Jesus fulfilled rather than abrogated the Law (Matt. 5:17–18). All later claims of prophecy must align with the “faith once delivered to the saints” (Jude 1:3).9. Rabbinic Commentary: Talmud, Midrash, and Medieval Jewish Thought9.1. The Talmud: Testing Prophets and Prophecya) Babylonian Talmud, Sanhedrin 90a–99bThe Talmud is clear that theTorah is eternal and unchangeable(Sanhedrin 99a):“He who says, ‘The entire Torah is from Heaven except one verse…’—such a one has despised the word of the Lord.”Sanhedrin 90a–93b:If a prophet’s message contravenes the Torah, even if accompanied by miracles, he is a false prophet and liable to death.“If he seeks to uproot even a single commandment, he is a false prophet.”b) Maimonides (Rambam, 1135–1204)In hisMishneh Torah, Laws of Foundations of the Torah, ch. 9–10:“If a prophet arises and performs a sign or wonder and says that God sent him to add to or to detract from a commandment…he is a false prophet.”“Even if he performs a sign, listen not to him.”InEpistle to Yemen, Maimonides identifies Muhammad as a “madman” who “added to and took away from the Torah” and thus cannot be accepted by the people of Israel.c) Rashi (1040–1105)On Deut. 13:2: “Even if he gives you a sign or a wonder…you shall not listen… For the Lord your God is testing you.”Rashi affirms that the test of a prophet is absoluteloyalty to the Torah, regardless of signs or wonders.9.2. Midrashic and Later Rabbinic ThoughtMidrash Tanchuma, Re’eh 13:“There will arise prophets who will say, ‘Let us go after other gods.’ The sign is not a proof, for the Law is above signs.”Rabbi Saadia Gaon (882–942):InThe Book of Beliefs and Opinions, Gaon maintains that only Moses had direct, unmediated prophecy; all others are subordinate and must conform to his Law.9.3. Jewish Evaluation of Later ClaimantsGeneral rabbinic opinion(from Maimonides to modern times) is that any claimant to prophecy who advocates abrogation or alteration of the Torah is anavi sheker(false prophet).Notably, both Islam and Christianity are viewed as forms ofsheker(false doctrine) where they diverge from Mosaic law. (SeeLetter to Yemen, Maimonides;Kuzariby Judah Halevi.)9.4. Rabbinic SummaryJewish tradition is explicit:The Torah is perfect, eternal, and unchangeable.Any prophet, no matter what signs he claims or performs, who seeks to alter the Torah or its commandments is to be rejected and, under Mosaic jurisdiction, put to death.10. Synthesis: The Voice of Moses, the Fathers, and the SagesThe combined witness of theMosaic Law, thePatristic Fathers, and theRabbinic Sagesestablishes a consistent rule of judgment:The Law of Moses is the absolute standard by which all future claims of revelation are measured.Muhammad’s teachings—introducing new laws, rituals, and a different concept of God—would be judged by Moses, the Church Fathers, and the rabbis alike as a clear breach, meriting condemnation.The patristic and rabbinic consensus is unwavering:fidelity to Torah is the litmus test for prophetic authenticity.11. ConclusionThebiblical,patristic, andrabbinictraditions are united:The Torah is inviolable;Any prophet contradicting or abrogating it is a false prophet, regardless of signs or claims;Muhammad, by his teaching and example, would have been judged and condemned under Mosaic Law, and declared false by the spiritual heirs of Moses in both the Synagogue and the Church.Expanded BibliographyPatristic Sources:Irenaeus,Against HeresiesTertullian,Prescription Against HereticsOrigen,Contra CelsumJohn of Damascus,Fount of KnowledgeRabbinic and Medieval Jewish Sources:Babylonian Talmud,Sanhedrin90a–99bRashi, Commentary on the TorahMaimonides,Mishneh TorahandEpistle to YemenSaadia Gaon,The Book of Beliefs and OpinionsMidrash TanchumaJudah Halevi,KuzariIslamic Sources:The Qur’anIbn Ishaq,Sirat Rasul AllahSahih al-Bukhari, Sahih MuslimModern Scholarship:Mark Durie,Revelation?

    "full_content": "Debate:Presented by Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThis debate seeks to rigorously examine the controversial claim that the Qur’an and authentic Hadiths provide evidence for Muhammad being identified as a false prophet by Allah Himself. The discussion will present both sides of the argument, encouraging scholarly discourse and critical engagement with the primary Islamic sources.Proposition: The Qur’an and Hadith Indicate Muhammad Was a False ProphetA. Scriptural Evidence from the Qur’anThe Qur’an provides the following passage:“And if [the Messenger] had made up about Us some [false] sayings, We would have seized him by the right hand; then We would have cut from him the aorta.”(Qur’an 69:44–46, Sahih International Translation)Analysis:This text is unambiguous: If Muhammad, the Messenger, were to fabricate revelations, Allah would punish him by cutting his \"aorta,\" the main artery of the heart, a fatal blow. This establishes a divine litmus test for prophetic authenticity—should Muhammad die by such means, it could be perceived as evidence of divine judgment.B. Testimony from Hadith Literature1. Sahih Bukhari 5:59:713At the end of his life, Muhammad reportedly said:“I feel as if my aorta is being cut from this poison.”2. Abu Dawud 34:4498Another narration echoes this:“I feel as if my aorta is being severed.”Analysis:According to Islamic tradition, Muhammad died after suffering for some time from the effects of poisoning. His own words invoke the very sign outlined in the Qur’an—his aorta being cut—which could be interpreted as fulfillment of Allah’s stated method of dealing with a false prophet.C. The Logical QuestionIf the Qur’an states that a false prophet’s aorta will be cut, and Muhammad himself claimed such an experience as he died, does this not constitute evidence, by the Qur’an’s own standard, that he was a false prophet?Why then do Muslims continue to follow Muhammad if, by this standard, he fits the Qur’an’s definition of a false prophet?Counterargument: Orthodox Islamic ResponseA balanced debate must present counterpoints as articulated by Muslim scholars and apologists.A. Context and InterpretationMuslim scholars argue that Qur’an 69:44–46 is a hypothetical warning, not a prophecy or historical prediction. The purpose of the passage is to underscore the severity of fabricating revelation, not to assert that Muhammad would actually do so. There is no evidence, they maintain, that Muhammad invented revelation.B. Nature of Muhammad’s DeathMuslim tradition holds that Muhammad’s death was ultimately natural, even though he suffered effects from poison. The mention of the aorta is metaphorical, describing the intensity of pain rather than a literal fulfillment of the Qur’anic warning.Scholarly References:Ibn KathirandTafsir al-Jalalaynboth emphasize the hypothetical nature of Qur’an 69:44–46.The poisoning incident (after the Battle of Khaybar) did not immediately cause Muhammad’s death, but only weakened him over time, according to most biographical sources.C. Prophet as MartyrSome Islamic scholars reinterpret Muhammad’s suffering from poison as a sign of his status as a martyr (shahid), rather than as evidence of falsity or divine punishment.D. Theological SafeguardsMuslims cite numerous other Qur’anic passages declaring Muhammad as a true prophet (e.g., Qur’an 33:40, 7:157).The verse is considered part of the Qur’an’s rhetorical style, warning not only Muhammad but all would-be false prophets throughout history.Rebuttal: Critical ReflectionsLiteral vs. Metaphorical:The Hadiths indicate that Muhammad himself invoked the language of the Qur’anic warning at his death. The coincidence invites further scrutiny as to whether this can be dismissed as merely metaphorical.Consistency of Standards:If a clear sign is given in scripture, and the sign is reportedly fulfilled, is it intellectually honest to reinterpret that sign only when it becomes problematic for doctrinal beliefs?Burden of Proof:If the Qur’an sets a test for a false prophet, should it not be applied consistently, even if the results are uncomfortable?ConclusionThis debate illustrates the complexity of interpreting scriptural texts and historical reports. The question remains deeply challenging:Does the conjunction of Qur’an 69:44–46 and Muhammad’s own death testimony suggest, by the Qur’an’s own standard, that he was a false prophet?Or does orthodox Islamic exegesis satisfactorily explain away the apparent contradiction?Scholars and seekers are encouraged to examine the evidence with intellectual honesty, utilizing rigorous critical methodologies and a commitment to truth.ReferencesThe Qur’an, Sahih International translation.Sahih Bukhari 5:59:713.Abu Dawud 34:4498.Tafsir Ibn Kathir, Tafsir al-Jalalayn.Sirat Ibn Ishaq, Al-Tabari’s History.Question for Further Debate:Should one accept a religious claim solely on faith, or must it be tested against the explicit standards set by its own scriptures?",

    "full_content": "EVIDENCE: ALLAH IS A CREATED BEING AND NOT THE ALMIGHTY GODBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Servant of Jesus ChristMax Shimba Ministries Org ©2015. All rights reserved.AbstractThis article critically examines Islamic descriptions of Allah as found in the Qur’an and authentic Hadith, analyzing anthropomorphic attributions such as face, garments, throne, hands, feet, and other bodily characteristics. Through detailed textual analysis, the article argues that such descriptions are fundamentally incompatible with the traditional concept of the Almighty God who is transcendent, incomparable, and uncreated. The work concludes by questioning the coherence of the Islamic portrayal of Allah in light of monotheistic theology.IntroductionThis subject is of profound significance for all who seek to understand the Islamic conception of God (Allah) and whether it aligns with the notion of the Almighty Creator or reveals Allah as a contingent, created being. Many Muslims assert that Allah is unlike any creature. However, Islamic texts repeatedly attribute human and creaturely characteristics to Allah. This study provides a critical exploration of such attributions as evidence that Allah, as described in Islamic sources, possesses features of created beings.1. Allah Possesses a Face Like Created BeingsQur’anic EvidenceSurah Al-Baqarah (2:115):“Wherever you turn, there is the Face of Allah.”This verse serves as a direct reply to those who deny that Allah possesses a face. Is not having a face a characteristic of human beings and creatures?Surah Al-Qasas (28:88):“Everything will perish except His Face.”Again, Allah openly affirms that He possesses a face, like created beings.2. Allah Wears Garments Like Created BeingsHadith EvidenceA Qudsi Hadith states:\"Pride is My upper garment, and majesty is My lower garment.\"If Allah is said to wear garments, does this not imply that He possesses a body like other creatures? This constitutes a significant theological problem.In another Qudsi Hadith, Allah says:“My servant draws near to Me with nothing more beloved to Me than the religious duties I have imposed upon him. My servant continues to draw near to Me with supererogatory works so that I shall love him. When I love him, I am his hearing with which he hears, his sight with which he sees, his hand with which he strikes, and his foot with which he walks.”Here, Allah admits to having ears, hands, eyes, and feet.3. Allah Sits on a Throne Like Created BeingsQur’anic EvidenceSurah Al-Haaqqah (69:17):“And the angels will be on its sides, and eight will, that Day, bear the Throne of your Lord above them.”Surah Al-Buruj (85:15):“Owner of the Throne, the Glorious.”If Allah possesses a throne, what purpose does it serve? Does Allah sit upon it as humans do? If He sits, does He have legs and feet like humans? If so, He is not different from created beings.Consider alsoSurah Al-Haaqqah (69:44-45):“And if he (Muhammad) had made up about Us some [false] sayings, We would have seized him by the right hand.”This indicates that Allah has a right hand. If Allah has a right hand, does He not also have a left? And if so, does He not also possess a mouth? Clearly, the doctrine that Allah is entirely incomparable becomes difficult to sustain.4. Allah Has Hands Like Created BeingsQur’anic and Hadith EvidenceSurah Az-Zumar (39:67):“They have not appraised Allah with true appraisal, while the earth entirely will be within His grip on the Day of Resurrection, and the heavens will be folded in His right hand.”Surah Al-Ma’idah (5:64):“The Jews say, ‘Allah’s hand is chained.’ May their hands be chained and cursed for what they say. Rather, both His hands are extended; He spends as He wills.”Surah Ya-Sin (36:83):“So exalted is He in whose hand is the realm of all things, and to Him you will be returned.”Surah Al Imran (3:26):“Say, ‘O Allah, Owner of Sovereignty, You give sovereignty to whom You will and You take sovereignty away from whom You will. You honor whom You will and You humble whom You will. In Your hand is [all] good. Indeed, You are over all things competent.’”Surah Sad (38:75):“[Allah] said, ‘O Iblis, what prevented you from prostrating to that which I created with My hands?’”Hadith literature further confirms these anthropomorphic descriptions, including traditions where Allah descends to the lowest heaven, stretches out His hands, and engages in conversations with prophets using His own hands.5. Allah Has Feet and Soles Like Created BeingsHadith and Classical CommentaryIslamic sources, including Sahih Bukhari, Sahih Muslim, Sunan Tirmidhi, Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal, and Tafsirs by Tabari, Ibn Kathir, and Suyuti, record narrations about Allah’s foot and sole.Abu Huraira narrated that the Prophet said:“Paradise and Hell argued... Thus Allah said to Paradise: ‘You are My mercy, through you I show mercy to those I will.’ And He said to Hell: ‘You are My punishment, through you I punish whom I will.’ Each will be filled, but Hell will not be satisfied until Allah places His Foot in it. Then it will say, ‘Enough, enough.’”If Hell will only be satisfied when Allah puts His Foot in it, does this not suggest Allah has a literal foot and is thus a being with form?6. Concluding ReflectionsFrom the above evidence, it becomes apparent that, as depicted in the Qur’an and Hadith, Allah is described in fundamentally anthropomorphic terms: He possesses a face, wears garments, sits on a throne, has hands, feet, and even bodily actions. This stands in sharp contrast with the biblical and classical philosophical view of God as wholly transcendent, immaterial, and utterly unlike His creation. The inescapable conclusion is that the Islamic conception of Allah, by its own scriptural testimony, renders Him a being not essentially different from created things.Final Questions to Muslim ReadersIf Allah is not a human or a created being, why does He repeatedly describe Himself using creaturely attributes?Why does Allah respond to Hell with His foot rather than with a word of authority alone?If Allah requires a throne and has bodily members, how does this not make Him a created being?May God bless you as you earnestly seek the truth.In His service,Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Servant of Jesus ChristMax Shimba Ministries Org ©2015.

    "full_content": "By Max Shimba, Servant of Jesus ChristShimba Theological Institute | Max Shimba Ministries Org ©2016IntroductionIn the previous installment, we firmly established that the God of the Bible possesses specific personal names, while the Islamic deity, Allah, as referenced in the Qur'an, is described through 99 attributes or names (Asma’ul Husna), as evidenced on Islamic educational platforms such as:https://www.islamicity.com/mosque/99names.htm.More importantly, we demonstrated that the term\"Allah\" is not a proper namebut atitleordesignation, comparable to the words “President” or “King.” Just as “President” is not a name but a position held by someone with an actual name—e.g., “President John Smith”—so too, \"Allah\" functions as a title and not a personal name.This leads us to the critical line of inquiry continued in this article:Is \"Allah\" a name or merely a descriptive title?And if he is truly the Most Merciful and the Most Compassionate, as Muslims often proclaim,what is his proper name?Islamic Invocation and Its ImplicationsMuslim sermons and invocations traditionally begin with the statement:“In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.”This immediately prompts an essential question:If God is “Most Gracious and Most Merciful,”what is His name?Titles such as “Gracious” and “Merciful” describe attributes, not names. Therefore, any rational theological inquiry should demand clarification:Two Critical Questions to MuslimsWhat is the personal name of the God whom you invoke as “Most Gracious and Most Merciful”?Please cite a Qur’anic verse clearly stating that name.If “Allah” is the actual proper name of God in Islam, can you provide a Qur’anic verse where God explicitly declares: “My name is Allah”?Appeal for Respectful DialogueDear Muslim friends, the objective of these questions is not to insult or provoke. We request that you refrain from harsh language, which unfortunately tends to follow such discussions. Instead, let us focus onintellectually rigorousandrespectful theological dialogue.What matters is your ability to substantiate your claim fromyour own Scripture—the Qur’an—and not simply repeat tradition.Biblical Revelation: God Reveals His NameIn sharp contrast to the ambiguity in the Qur'an regarding a personal name for Allah, theBible provides clear and direct revelations of God's name.Exodus 3:13–14 (KJV)records the following dialogue:“And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? What shall I say unto them?”And God said unto Moses, “I AM THAT I AM”: and he said, “Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel,I AMhath sent me unto you.”This profound declaration is bothontological and revelatory—God defines Himself as the self-existent one, the uncaused cause.Later, inExodus 6:2–3, we find:“And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the LORD:And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name ofGod Almighty, but by my nameJEHOVAHwas I not known to them.”This shows aprogressive revelationof God's personal name, which He discloses at the appropriate time to His covenant people.Contrast with Allah’s 99 NamesIt is indeed perplexing that “Allah,” despite having what are referred to as \"99 names\" in Islamic tradition, never disclosesa singular personal namein the Qur'an with the specificity found in the Judeo-Christian Scriptures.Furthermore, these so-called “names” are mostlyattributes or characteristics, not personal names in the linguistic or theological sense.An honest seeker must ask: If Allah is the God of Abraham, Moses, David, and Jesus as claimed, why is His name not revealed in the Torah, Psalms, or the Gospels? TheGod of the Bible does not hide His identity.Biblical Names of God: A Window into His NatureExploring the various names of God in the Bible gives us deeper insights into His nature. Consider the following:Elohim– The Mighty Creator (Genesis 1:1)Adonai– Lord, Master (Exodus 4:10,13)El Elyon– God Most High (Genesis 14:20)El Roi– The God Who Sees (Genesis 16:13)El Shaddai– God Almighty (Genesis 17:1)El Olam– The Everlasting God (Isaiah 40:28)YHWH (Yahweh)– “I AM,” the self-existent One (Exodus 3:13–14)These are not mere epithets—they are revelatorydisclosures of God's being and personhood, each deeply rooted in covenantal interaction with His people.ConclusionDear reader, even you—being human—possess a name. So why would the supreme God not reveal His name? The Islamic concept of Allah isabsent of personal self-disclosure. This is vastly different from the God of the Bible whopersonally reveals Himself, makescovenants, and communicates Hisnamesto His people.Therefore, we are compelled to conclude that “Allah” is not a personal name but ageneric title, and thusnot the sameasYahweh, the God of Moses, Abraham, David, and Jesus.Final BlessingMay God bless you as you seek the truth.I am,Max Shimba,Servant of Jesus Christ,For Max Shimba Ministries OrgNote:This document is permitted for reproduction and distributionin full and without modification.Max Shimba Ministries Org ©2016.

    "full_content": "The Myth of Islamic Claims to the Land of Israel: A Theological and Historical ReappraisalBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThe ongoing conflict over the Land of Israel remains one of the most contentious and misunderstood issues in contemporary religious, political, and academic discourse. Central to this debate is the persistent assertion from segments of the Muslim world regarding an alleged Islamic right to the Jewish homeland—a claim that, upon theological, historical, and textual scrutiny, proves to be both recent and ideologically motivated, rather than divinely or historically mandated.This article critically examines the foundations of Islamic claims to the Holy Land, the nature of Arab hostility toward the Jewish people and Israel, and the manipulation of religious identity and scripture for political objectives. In doing so, it seeks not only to address the misconceptions propagated in the Muslim world but also to liberate sincere Muslims from ideological bondage imposed by pan-Arabist and Islamist agendas.Historical Context: The Land of Israel and Its Ancient OwnershipHistorically, the Land of Israel—known biblically as Canaan, then as Judea and Israel—has been universally recognized as the ancestral homeland of the Jewish people. The Hebrew Bible, as well as subsequent Jewish, Christian, and even early Islamic traditions, affirm that God allocated this territory to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (see Genesis 17:8; Exodus 6:4).The notion that Israel was ever a fundamentally Muslim land before its allocation to the Jews is unsustainable. Prior to the seventh-century Arab conquests, neither the land nor its people were governed by Islamic law or identity. During the periods of Israelite, Judaean, Greek, Roman, and even Byzantine rule, the prevailing religions were Judaism and Christianity—not Islam. Indeed, Islam itself emerged in the Arabian Peninsula centuries after the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in the region.The transformation of the land's name from \"Judea\" to \"Palestina\" by the Romans after the Bar Kokhba revolt (135 CE) was not a reflection of indigenous Arab or Islamic heritage but a calculated act of erasure aimed at diminishing Jewish national identity.The Islamicization of the Israel-Palestine ConflictThe modern Islamic claim to the land is largely a product of twentieth-century political developments, rather than ancient religious entitlement. Prior to the 1948 establishment of the State of Israel, no independent Muslim state called \"Palestine\" ever existed; rather, the territory was administered variously by Ottoman Turks and then the British Mandate.As documented in the foundational charters of Arab and Palestinian organizations, the struggle against Israel has often been framed in overtly religious and annihilatory terms. The Palestinian National Charter, for example, asserts that \"Islam shall be the official religion in Palestine\" and that \"the principles of Islamic jurisprudence shall be the main source of legislation.\" The language of jihad and shariah is thus central to the ideology of contemporary Palestinian nationalism.Moreover, leaders such as Zohir Mohsen (PLO Executive Committee Member) have openly admitted that Palestinian national identity is a tactical construct serving the broader pan-Arab objective of confronting Zionism. In a 1977 interview with the Dutch newspaper Trouw, Mohsen stated, “There are no differences between Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians, and Lebanese. We are all part of one people, the Arab nation. Just for political reasons we carefully underwrite our Palestinian identity. Because it is of national interest for the Arabs to advocate the existence of Palestinians to balance Zionism. Yes, the existence of a separate Palestinian identity exists only for tactical reasons.”This candid admission undermines the narrative of an indigenous, continuous Palestinian people dispossessed by Zionism. Instead, it exposes the political use of identity to perpetuate hostility toward Jewish sovereignty.Islamic Theological Hostility Toward the JewsEnmity toward the Jewish people, as expressed in certain Islamic texts and later theological developments, is not inherent to Islam’s original message but rather evolved within specific historical contexts. While the Qur'an recounts theological disputes between Muhammad and the Jewish tribes of Arabia (e.g., Quran 2:40-61), there is no Quranic mandate for perpetual warfare against the Jews or for the exclusive Islamic ownership of the Land of Israel. Interpretations that promote such hostilities are influenced by later jurisprudential and polemical traditions rather than the core scriptural message.Notably, modern expressions of anti-Jewish hostility are often couched in language that fuses religious duty with Arab political ambitions. The rhetoric of organizations such as Hamas, Hizbollah, and others routinely frames the destruction of Israel as an Islamic imperative, thereby conflating Arab nationalism with universal Islamic obligations. This fusion is a relatively recent innovation and does not reflect the attitudes of earlier Islamic empires, many of which maintained diplomatic and even friendly relations with Jewish communities—including, notably, pre-revolutionary Iran.The Weaponization of Religion and the Path ForwardThe Islamic Revolution in Iran (1979) marked a turning point, with the Ayatollah Khomeini's regime imposing Islamist ideology and aligning Iran with pan-Islamic hostility toward Israel. Prior to this, Iran and Israel maintained cordial relations. The rise of jihadist organizations and the subsequent regionalization of the Israeli-Arab conflict are, therefore, not products of ancient hatreds but of modern political developments.Charters of Arab organizations explicitly reveal their goals: the annihilation of Israel and the subjugation of its land and people under Islamic law, as articulated in foundational documents and the statements of founding leaders. The Palestinian Charter, for example, insists on the establishment of Jerusalem as the capital of \"Palestine\" and the implementation of shariah, while early PLO documents refrained from claiming sovereignty over territories controlled by other Arab states, focusing solely on the destruction of Israel.ConclusionThe claim that there ever existed an independent Islamic nation known as \"Palestine\" is historically unfounded. The use of religious rhetoric to justify political violence against Israel serves to perpetuate enmity and obscures the true origins of the conflict: the refusal to accept Jewish sovereignty in the land historically and biblically allocated to them.For sincere Muslims, it is imperative to distinguish between genuine Islamic faith and the instrumentalization of religion for Arabist and jihadist agendas. Liberation from the ideological bondage of Arab nationalism cloaked in Islamic rhetoric is essential not only for peace in the region but for the integrity of the Islamic faith itself.Let us therefore seek truth over propaganda, peace over perpetual conflict, and faithfulness to the historical and theological record over the distortions of political expediency.ReferencesThe Holy Bible, Genesis 12–17; Exodus 6The Holy Qur'an, Surahs 2, 4, 5Palestinian National Charter, 1964, 1968Interview with Zohir Mohsen, Trouw, March 31, 1977Ahmed Al-Shuqairy,A Mandate for Terror, 1969Bernard Lewis,The Middle East: A Brief History of the Last 2,000 Years, 1995Martin Gilbert,Israel: A History, 1998",

    "full_content": "God Has Warned Us Not to Associate with JinnBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute / Max Shimba Ministries Org ©2016AbstractThis article provides a comparative theological examination between the Biblical teaching on demonic spirits (commonly called “jinn” in Islam) and the Islamic portrayal of jinn as beings capable of worshipping Allah and embracing Islam. Through scriptural references from the Bible and the Qur’an, the article exposes irreconcilable differences in theology, divine nature, and spiritual truth. The study reveals that while the Bible categorically forbids any relationship with spirits or jinn, the Qur’an incorporates jinn as part of the spiritual community of Muslims. This paper aims to equip readers with biblical discernment and offer a Christ-centered alternative to the Islamic worldview on jinn.1. Introduction: A Divine Warning Against SpiritismThe Bible offers clear guidance concerning the interaction between humans and spiritual beings, especially demonic spirits. Scripture repeatedly warns God’s people against consulting with mediums, necromancers, or engaging in any form of spiritism.\"Do not turn to mediums or necromancers; do not seek them out, and so make yourselves unclean by them: I am the LORD your God.\"—Leviticus 19:31 (ESV)God prohibited Israel from adopting pagan practices such as invoking spirits or engaging in occultism. The gravity of such practices is further emphasized:\"When you come into the land that the LORD your God is giving you, you shall not learn to follow the abominable practices of those nations... There shall not be found among you anyone who burns his son or his daughter as an offering, anyone who practices divination or tells fortunes or interprets omens... For whoever does these things is an abomination to the LORD.\"—Deuteronomy 18:9–122. Biblical Exposition on the Nature of Demons (Jinn)The Bible gives insights into the origin, identity, and final destiny of demons. They are fallen angels, formerly in heaven, cast down due to rebellion against God:\"Now war arose in heaven, Michael and his angels fighting against the dragon... And the great dragon was thrown down, that ancient serpent, who is called the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world—he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.\"—Revelation 12:7–9These beings (calledshedimin Hebrew ordaimoniain Greek) are unclean spirits that seek to deceive and inhabit people. Jesus Christ consistently demonstrated His divine authority by casting out demons:\"As we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a slave girl who had a spirit of divination... But Paul, greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, 'I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.' And it came out that very hour.\"—Acts 16:16–183. Islamic Theology: Jinn as Believers and MuslimsIn stark contrast, Islamic theology not only acknowledges the existence of jinn but also asserts that some jinn have converted to Islam and serve Allah. The Qur’an even devotes an entire chapter (Surah Al-Jinn) to this concept.\"Say: It has been revealed to me that a group of the jinn listened and said, 'Indeed, we have heard an amazing Qur’an. It guides to the right course, and we have believed in it...'\"—Qur’an 72:1–2The Qur’an goes further to claim that jinn were created for the purpose of worshipping Allah:\"I did not create jinn and mankind except to worship Me.\"—Qur’an 51:56Additionally, Qur’an 6:130 explicitly states that Allah sent messengers to both humans and jinn:\"O company of jinn and mankind, did there not come to you messengers from among you, relating to you My verses and warning you of the meeting of this Day of yours?\"—Qur’an 6:130These statements raise significant theological contradictions when compared to the Biblical God, who rejects communion with unclean spirits.4. The Biblical God Versus the Allah of the Qur’anIn Christianity, demons (jinn) are unredeemable, fallen beings awaiting judgment. Their end is in eternal fire:\"And the devil who had deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur where the beast and the false prophet were... And if anyone’s name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.\"—Revelation 20:10, 15Yet in the Qur’an, these same spiritual entities are said to have believed, worshipped, and inherited paradise (Akhira). This poses fundamental theological dissonance. For example:InQur’an 72:14, it is claimed that believing jinn will enter paradise.InQur’an 6:128, Allah promises hellfire to many humans and jinn collectively.5. Jesus and Jinn: The Irrefutable AuthorityJesus never allied with demons. He consistently rebuked, silenced, and cast them out with divine authority. This clearly sets Him apart from the Qur’anic view where Muhammad is surrounded by and served by jinn:\"And demons also came out of many, crying, 'You are the Son of God!' But he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.\"—Luke 4:41Jesus’ relationship with demons is one of conflict and dominion—not tolerance or cooperation.6. The Quranic Paradox: Paradise or Hell for Jinn?There is deep ambiguity in Islamic eschatology regarding the final destiny of jinn. Though the Qur’an claims that righteous jinn may inherit paradise, it also says they are companions in hell with sinful humans:\"He will say, 'Enter among nations who had passed away before you of jinn and mankind into the Fire.'\"—Qur’an 6:128This contradiction further problematizes the Islamic portrayal of jinn as spiritually redeemable beings.7. Theological Reflection: Can God Be Friends with Demons?In the Bible, those who consult with spirits were to be executed (Leviticus 20:27). God declared such practices as defilement and rebellion. Yet Islam incorporates jinn into its spiritual framework as worshippers and even companions of prophets. This reveals a profound theological discrepancy.If Jesus casts out jinn (demons), how can Allah embrace them?Conclusion: Choose the God of the BibleThe evidence is clear:The God of the Bible forbids and judges communion with demons.Jesus casts them out with authority, offering spiritual freedom.Allah, in contrast, embraces jinn as Muslim believers and even assigns them prophets.This contrast compels every seeker of truth to decide:Will you follow the Holy God who delivers from demonic power, or a god who accepts jinn as part of his spiritual family?\"I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.\"—John 14:6 (Jesus Christ)Call to ActionDear reader, the truth is not hidden. Flee from unclean spirits and spiritual deception. Run to Jesus—the only One who conquers the powers of darkness. In Him is light, salvation, and eternal life.Come to Jesus Christ—the only way to Heaven.God bless you abundantly.Dr. Maxwell ShimbaServant of the Lord Jesus ChristFor Max Shimba Ministries Org©2016.

    "full_content": "Title: The Theological Crisis of Shared Divine Attributes in Islam: Unveiling the Islamic DilemmaBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis paper explores the theological inconsistencies within Islamic doctrine by focusing on the shared use of divine attributes—specifically\"An-Nur\" (The Light)—between Allah and Muhammad. In Islam, the 99 Names of Allah are said to be uniquely divine and exclusive. Yet, Islamic tradition ascribes the title \"An-Nur\" not only to Allah but also to Muhammad, raising critical theological questions. This scholarly article contends that such overlap reflects a profound internal contradiction within Islamic monotheism and argues that the cessation of divine revelation after Muhammad's death indicates thatMuhammad functioned as the voice and persona of Allah, thereby collapsing the distinction between the messenger and the deity he proclaimed.IntroductionIslam presents itself as a strictly monotheistic faith, asserting the oneness and incomparability of Allah (Tawheed). Central to this claim are the 99 Names of Allah—attributes believed to uniquely define His essence. Yet, an examination of Islamic sources reveals that some of these divine names are simultaneously attributed to Muhammad. Among the most striking examples is \"An-Nur\" (The Light), a title found both in Allah’s names and among the epithets of Muhammad. This shared attribute invites serious theological scrutiny and casts doubt on Islam’s claim of a clear demarcation between the Creator and the created.The Shared Attribute: An-Nur (The Light)TheQur’an (24:35)describes Allah as “the Light of the heavens and the earth,” a powerful and exclusive claim. “An-Nur” is thus recognized as one of the most revered of Allah’s names. However, Islamic literature—including Hadith and prophetic biographies—frequently refers to Muhammad as “An-Nur,” “Siraj al-Muneer” (Illuminating Lamp), and “Misbah” (Lamp), terms that functionally overlap with the divine title.Why would a religion so insistent on monotheism and divine transcendence allow such a sacred attribute to be duplicated in a created being?If “An-Nur” is unique to Allah, then ascribing it to Muhammad isshirk(associating others with God)—a sin that the Qur’an deems unforgivable (Surah 4:48). Yet, if Muhammadcanrightly bear this attribute, it blurs the boundary between deity and man, pointing to a deeper theological confusion.Is Muhammad Allah? The Question of RevelationAnother glaring issue is thetotal silence of Allah post-Muhammad. For a God described as “Ever-Speaking” (al-Kalim), the end of revelation at Muhammad’s death suggests an anthropocentric dependency. Christianity, by contrast, teaches that God speaks across covenants and through various prophets and ultimately through His Son. But in Islam,Allah's voice ceases the moment Muhammad dies.This naturally raises the question: Was Allah simply Muhammad’s projection? The halt in divine speech implies thatAllah had no voice apart from Muhammad’s, making it plausible thatMuhammad was himself the embodiment, or fabrication, of Allah. The divine ceased to exist in communicative form after the prophet’s death, reinforcing the idea that Islam was aman-centered invention rather than a God-centered revelation.Theological Implications and ContradictionsViolation of Divine UniquenessIslam teaches that Allah has no equals or partners (Surah 112). Yet calling Muhammad “An-Nur,” a name reserved for Allah, directly challenges this teaching. Either Muhammad shares in divinity, or the uniqueness of Allah is compromised.The Prophet as the DeityThe Qur’an never explicitly states that Muhammad isonlya man. Combined with the elevated honorifics and cessation of revelation posthumously, this opens the door to interpreting Muhammad not as a prophetofAllah, but a manifestationasAllah.Post-Muhammad Silence of AllahNo further messengers, no more books, no more prophecies—just silence. If Allah is eternal and unchanging, why would His revelations stop with one man? This suggests the message was tied not to God, but to the life and influence of a singular individual—Muhammad.ConclusionThe theological issues presented by the shared title of “An-Nur” and the silence of Allah after Muhammad’s death challenge the very foundations of Islam. These contradictions expose the possibility that Islam is not a divine religion, but aman-made systemcarefully constructed to place Muhammad at the center—not only as a messenger but as the personification of Allah.In conclusion, thecollapse of divine distinction,shared divine attributes, andposthumous divine silenceserve as compelling evidence that Muhammad was, in the structure of Islam, effectivelyAllah in disguise. Thus,Islam fails the test of theological coherenceand cannot be sustained as an authentic monotheistic revelation.About the AuthorDr. Maxwell Shimba is a leading Restorative Justice practitioner, Bible scholar, and founder of the USA Theological University in Florida.

    "full_content": "Inconsistencies in the Qur’an Regarding the Days of Creation: Six Days or Eight Days?By Dr. Maxwell Shimba | Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis article critically examines one of the theological and textual inconsistencies found within the Qur’an concerning the number of days it took Allah to create the heavens and the earth. While the Islamic scripture, in several verses, affirms a six-day creation account, a careful reading of other passages suggests an eight-day sequence. This discrepancy has sparked significant debate among classical and modern Muslim exegetes. The paper presents a scholarly analysis of these conflicting accounts, their implications for Qur’anic inerrancy, and the broader theological consequences for the doctrine of divine omniscience within Islamic thought.IntroductionOne of the fundamental narratives shared across the Abrahamic faiths is the account of the creation of the world. In the Bible, the book of Genesis outlines a clear six-day creation, with God resting on the seventh day. The Qur’an, which claims to affirm the previous revelations (Torah and Gospel) while correcting alleged distortions, also addresses the creation narrative. However, a textual analysis of various Qur’anic passages reveals inconsistencies in the reported number of days required for creation. Some verses affirm six days, while others, when read cumulatively, suggest eight days. This raises important questions regarding the internal consistency of the Qur’an, a text Muslims hold to be the uncreated, perfect word of Allah.The Qur’anic Six-Day Creation VersesSeveral Qur’anic passages explicitly state that the heavens and the earth were created in six days:Surah Al-A’raf (7:54)“Indeed, your Lord is Allah, who created the heavens and the earth in six days; then He established Himself above the Throne.”Surah Yunus (10:3)“Indeed, your Lord is Allah, who created the heavens and the earth in six days and then established Himself above the Throne.”Surah Hud (11:7)“And it is He who created the heavens and the earth in six days – and His Throne had been upon water.”Surah Al-Furqan (25:59)“He who created the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them in six days, then established Himself above the Throne – the Most Merciful.”These verses unambiguously affirm a six-day creation timeline, aligning superficially with the biblical narrative.The Eight-Day Creation Dilemma: Surah Fussilat 41:9-12A significant contradiction appears inSurah Fussilat (41:9-12):41:9“Say, ‘Do you indeed disbelieve in He who created the earth in two days and attribute to Him equals? That is the Lord of the worlds.’”41:10“And He placed on it firmly set mountains over its surface, and He blessed it and determined therein its sustenance in four days, without distinction – for those who ask.”41:11-12“Then He directed Himself to the heaven while it was smoke and said to it and to the earth, ‘Come willingly or by compulsion.’ They said, ‘We have come willingly.’ And He completed them as seven heavens within two days and inspired in each heaven its command.”Breakdown of Days:Creation of Earth:2 days(41:9)Formation of mountains, blessings, sustenance:4 days(41:10)Formation of the heavens:2 days(41:12)Total: 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 daysThus, according to this passage, creation required eight days — contradicting the multiple earlier declarations of a six-day creation period.Exegetical Attempts at ReconciliationMuslim exegetes, both classical and contemporary, have grappled with this apparent inconsistency. Some notable interpretations include:Sequential versus Simultaneous Days:Some scholars suggest that the four days mentioned in verse 41:10 include the initial two days of creating the earth — meaning the sustenance and mountains’ arrangement tooktwo additional days, not four. This interpretation, however, conflicts with the straightforward Arabic phrasing, which numerically distinguishes the periods.Ambiguity in Arabic Syntax:Another argument claims that the Arabic construction allows for overlap or non-sequential counting. However, this introduces arbitrary flexibility to the reading and undermines the clarity of the Qur’anic narrative.Divine Days versus Human Days:A common apologetic is that \"days\" in God’s reckoning are not equal to human days (cf. Qur'an 22:47, 32:5). Yet this does not address the numerical inconsistency but only their duration, leaving the total count unresolved.Implications for Qur’anic InerrancyThe doctrine ofi‘jaz al-Qur’an(the inimitability and perfection of the Qur’an) holds that the scripture is free of contradiction. The apparent discrepancy between a six-day and an eight-day creation narrative poses a challenge to this claim. If the Qur’an cannot maintain numerical consistency in a fundamental theological account, it undermines its asserted divine authorship and perfection.Furthermore, the Qur’an claims:“Do they not then reflect on the Qur’an? If it had been from other than Allah, they would have found within it much contradiction.”(Surah An-Nisa 4:82)By its standard, the inconsistency in the number of creation days invites scrutiny regarding the divine origin of the text.Comparison with the Biblical AccountThe Bible maintains a coherent six-day creation narrative inGenesis 1, with each day’s activity carefully delineated and the seventh day set aside for rest. Despite differences in cosmology, the biblical narrative remains internally consistent — a sharp contrast to the Qur’an’s conflicting timelines.ConclusionThe Qur’anic narrative on the creation of the world suffers from a significant internal inconsistency regarding the number of days involved in the act of creation. While some verses clearly state a six-day timeline, a detailed reading ofSurah Fussilat 41:9-12cumulatively suggests an eight-day process. Muslim exegetical attempts to reconcile this contradiction either stretch the natural reading of the Arabic text or introduce speculative theological constructs.This inconsistency raises serious questions about the Qur’an’s claim of being free from contradictions and perfectly preserved. It further challenges the Islamic doctrine of Allah’s omniscience and the Qur’an’s status as the uncreated, flawless word of God.About the AuthorDr. Maxwell Shimbais a theologian, biblical scholar, and director of theShimba Theological Institute.

    "full_content": "The Thirty-Two Sins of Muhammad: A Scholarly Theological ExposéBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractMuhammad, founder of Islam, is venerated as the final prophet and an exemplary moral leader by Muslims. Yet a rigorous theological and historical inquiry, especially when set against biblical ethical paradigms, reveals profound inconsistencies in his teachings and conduct. This paper critically analyzes thirty-two moral and theological failings attributed to Muhammad, engaging both Islamic primary sources and critical scholarship, to assess their implications for the claim of prophetic legitimacy.1.Institution of Veiling (Hijab) Not Ordained by GodThe Qur'an’s prescription for veiling (Q 33:59) is absent from prior Abrahamic scriptures and is argued by critics to reflect social control rather than divine ordinance. Scholars such as Cook (2001) observe that the imposition of hijab is neither universal in pre-Islamic Arabia nor part of Christian/Jewish law, raising questions about its revelatory status1.2.Ordinance of PolygamyUnlike New Testament ethics which uphold monogamy (1 Tim. 3:2), Muhammad allowed men up to four wives (Q 4:3), and for himself, an even broader sexual prerogative (Q 33:50). Peters (1994) notes that the Qur’anic basis for polygamy facilitated rapid population growth and social alliances, but its divine origin is contestable2.3.Exclusive Sexual PrivilegesThe Qur’an provides Muhammad with unique marital exemptions (Q 33:50–51), allowing him to marry any woman who offered herself to him, a privilege denied even to his followers. Ibn Ishaq records multiple instances of these personal revelations3. Critics regard this as self-serving and ethically problematic.4.Revelations Driven by LustNumerous Qur’anic revelations seem tailored to Muhammad’s immediate desires, especially regarding marriage and sexual relations (e.g., Q 33:37, legitimizing his marriage to Zaynab, his adopted son’s ex-wife). Watt (1956) and others discuss the apologetic responses and the moral ambiguities involved4.5.Sexual Enslavement of CaptivesAfter the Battle of Khaybar, Muhammad took Safiyya bint Huyayy as a concubine (Ibn Ishaq, p. 511; Bukhari 5:59:512). The permissibility of sexual relations with female captives (Q 4:24) is widely attested. Modern scholars universally critique this as a violation of contemporary and biblical moral norms5.6.Women's Testimony Valued as HalfQur’an 2:282 explicitly states that a woman’s testimony is worth half that of a man’s. This legal provision institutionalizes gender inequality, diverging sharply from the Christian doctrine of equality in Christ (Galatians 3:28) and from the Old Testament’s evolving ethics6.7.Sanctioning Wife-BeatingQur’an 4:34 authorizes husbands to “strike” their wives as a last resort in marital disputes. This has led to extensive controversy in both Islamic and non-Islamic contexts, with attempts at reinterpretation failing to mask the plain sense of the text7.8.Initiation of Caravan RaidingThe first Muslim attack on a Meccan caravan at Nakhla occurred during a sacred month (Ibn Ishaq, pp. 286–288), violating Arabian tradition. This action established a precedent for jihad as offensive warfare for material gain, which is ethically and theologically contestable8.9.Assassination of CriticsHistorical accounts record Muhammad ordering the assassination of poets who criticized him, such as Asma bint Marwan and Ka’b ibn al-Ashraf (Ibn Ishaq, pp. 676–682). These acts, justified as “defending the faith,” are inconsistent with the prophetic forbearance in the biblical tradition9.10.Refusal to Reconcile with Jews and ChristiansQur’anic hostility towards Jews and Christians (Q 5:51; 9:29–30) and Muhammad’s actions during his Medinan years show an unwillingness to foster reconciliation, contrary to the biblical imperative for peace with all people (Romans 12:18)10.11.Participation in the Massacre of Banu QurayzaAfter the siege of Banu Qurayza, sources agree that Muhammad authorized and possibly participated in the beheading of approximately 600–900 Jewish men (Ibn Ishaq, pp. 461–464; Bukhari 5:59:362). This massacre remains a central critique of his moral legacy11.12.Authorizing Murder of Non-BelieversNumerous Qur’anic verses (e.g., Q 9:5; 9:29) and hadiths call for the killing of unbelievers, especially during the post-Hijra period. This is sharply at odds with the biblical injunction to love one’s enemies (Matthew 5:44)12.13.Anti-Semitic RhetoricMuhammad is recorded as referring to Jews as “apes and pigs” (Q 2:65; 5:60). Such derogatory rhetoric has fueled centuries of anti-Semitism in Islamic societies (Lewis, 1984)13.14.Failure to Correct Corrupt LawsAccording to Zahid Khan and some critical Muslim traditions, Muhammad allegedly refused divine requests to amend or retract self-serving or harsh laws he had issued, raising the issue of prophetic fallibility and moral flexibility14.15.Refusal to Limit MarriagesDespite alleged divine commands to divorce excess wives (beyond the four permitted for Muslims), Muhammad retained his privileges (Q 33:52), further highlighting the personal exemption principle15.16.Refusal to Unite with ChristianityKhan claims that Muhammad was divinely requested to seek unity with the Christian church but chose religious exclusivism (Q 9:33; 61:9). No explicit record exists in Islamic sources, but the trajectory of his later revelations supports this exclusivist approach16.17.Religious Supremacism and IntoleranceMuhammad’s later revelations increasingly declare the supremacy of Islam and the need to suppress other faiths (Q 9:33). This contrasts with early Meccan tolerance and with the pluralism of biblical prophecy (Isaiah 56:7)17.18.Refusal to Seek Interfaith UnityDespite Qur’anic statements inviting People of the Book to common terms (Q 3:64), Muhammad’s actual policies led to the subjugation and marginalization of Jews and Christians in Arabia18.19.Expansionist Marital PolicyThe legal allowance for four wives, with the purpose of quickly increasing the Muslim population, is seen as strategic rather than ethical (Peters, 1994)19.20.Claims of Seeing God’s Form Without WitnessMuhammad’s ascension (mi’raj) claims private visionary experiences (Bukhari 5:58:227), but these were never witnessed or corroborated, raising epistemological and prophetic legitimacy questions20.21.Refusal of Religious Partnership with JesusIslamic theology positions Muhammad as the “Seal of the Prophets” (Q 33:40), but polemical literature accuses him of refusing collaboration with Jesus, whose status in Christianity is unique and unshared (Q 4:171)21.22.Creation of a New ReligionTraditions suggest that Muhammad’s divergence from both Judaism and Christianity resulted in a new religious system, despite the Qur’an’s claims of continuity (Q 2:135). Some Islamic apologists accept this as divine innovation, while critics see it as opportunistic22.23.Ignoring Gabriel’s CounselSeveral hadiths record Muhammad being admonished by Gabriel for mistakes or omissions (e.g., Bukhari 1:1:3), but critics allege selective or self-serving obedience23.24.Refusal to Edit Out His Own VersesCritical tradition claims Muhammad was requested by God to remove certain personal or harsh verses but refused, challenging the Islamic doctrine of the Qur’an’s divine perfection24.25.Responsibility for Arab-Israeli HostilitySome scholars, such as Lewis (1984), trace modern Arab-Jewish conflict to Muhammad’s precedent of hostility toward Jews, particularly through the events in Medina25.26.Exiling Jewish TribesMuhammad’s expulsion of Banu Qaynuqa and Banu Nadir and the massacre of Banu Qurayza are well-documented (Ibn Ishaq, pp. 437–464). These acts have been critiqued as ethnic cleansing26.27.Lack of Compassion for JewsDespite Qur’anic claims that “there is no compulsion in religion” (Q 2:256), Muhammad’s actions towards Jewish tribes were devoid of reconciliation or compassion27.28.Ordering Death of Rival ProphetsMuhammad allegedly ordered the death of Musaylimah and other rival prophets during the Wars of Apostasy (Ridda), establishing a violent standard for religious leadership28.29.Extracting Harsh Laws from Older TraditionsMuhammad implemented legal punishments (stoning, amputation, lashing) drawn from pre-Islamic and Old Testament laws, but without the redemptive context found in later biblical revelation29.30.Triple Talaq DivorceMuhammad sanctioned divorce by pronouncement of “talaq” three times (Bukhari 7:63:197), a practice later regarded as detrimental to women’s rights even within Muslim reform movements30.31.Prohibition of Marrying His WidowsQur’an 33:53 forbids Muslims from marrying Muhammad’s widows, motivated by concern for his posthumous reputation. This contrasts with Old Testament and Christian traditions, which provide for widows’ remarriage31.32.Misleading Promises of Heavenly RewardsThe Qur’anic promise of “virgins” for martyrs (Q 56:22–24; 78:31–33) has been interpreted as temporally limited by some critics, yet Muhammad did not clarify this, leading to centuries of doctrinal confusion and extremism32.ConclusionEach of the thirty-two points elaborated above is supported by primary Islamic sources and examined through the lens of critical, interfaith, and biblical ethics. This comprehensive review reveals deep tensions between Muhammad’s legacy and the ethical standards of prophetic monotheism. The imperative for open academic discourse on these matters remains vital for genuine understanding and interfaith relations.ReferencesThis expanded academic exposé is suitable for theological, historical, or interfaith studies journals.

This article examines the admissions of sinfulness by the Prophet Muhammad as reported in Islamic tradition, contrasts it with the biblical testimony concerning the sinlessness of Jesus Christ, and discusses the theological implications for forgiveness and salvation.Muhammad’s Repeated Pleas for ForgivenessAccording to Islamic primary sources, Prophet Muhammad frequently sought forgiveness from God, indicating a consciousness of sin. The hadith recorded inSahih Muslimstates:“Al-Agharr al-Muzani, who was one of the Companions, reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: ‘There is sometimes a shade upon my heart, and I seek forgiveness from Allah a hundred times a day.’”(Sahih Muslim, Book 35, Hadith 6522)The expression “a shade upon my heart” is understood by classical and modern Islamic scholars as an acknowledgment of spiritual imperfection or a lingering sense of guilt. Notably, Muhammad’s need to seek forgiveness a hundred times a day stands as a testament to his acute awareness of his own moral shortcomings.The Qur’an, on the other hand, exalts Muhammad’s character, stating:“And indeed, you are of a great moral character.”(Qur’an 68:4, translation by Muhammad Knut Bernström)This verse has been interpreted to emphasize Muhammad’s exemplary nature. Yet, the persistent seeking of forgiveness recorded in authentic hadith traditions seems to be in tension with the claim of moral perfection, raising important theological questions.Universal Sinfulness According to the BibleChristian doctrine asserts that all humans are sinners. The Apostle Paul affirms:“For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.”(Romans 3:23, ESV)This universal declaration of sinfulness includes all individuals—prophets and common people alike. If Muhammad is to be included in this universal category, then his repeated pleas for forgiveness are to be expected from a biblical perspective.Did Muhammad’s Sins Receive Forgiveness?In his bookEnd of the Line, Reza Safa reports a tradition where Muhammad’s wife Khadija asked him if his sins were forgiven. Muhammad replied that he was not sure whether his own sins were forgiven. This uncertainty is significant because it reveals a lack of assurance regarding divine pardon, even for Islam’s preeminent prophet.The Sinlessness of Jesus ChristIn stark contrast, the New Testament asserts unequivocally the sinlessness of Jesus Christ. The Epistle to the Hebrews declares:“For we do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are—yet he did not sin.”(Hebrews 4:15, NIV)Because Jesus was without sin, He was uniquely qualified to serve as the savior and mediator between God and humanity. The Bible teaches that through His sacrificial death on the cross, Jesus took upon Himself the sins of the world (cf. 1 Peter 2:22-24; 2 Corinthians 5:21).Theological ImplicationsThe significance of these facts is profound. Jesus’ sinlessness enables Him to forgive sins and offer salvation, something Muhammad, by his own admission and Islamic testimony, could not claim for himself. The assurance of salvation and forgiveness in Christianity is grounded in the perfection of Christ, whereas Muhammad’s example is one of continual repentance without certain assurance.ConclusionIn conclusion, both Islamic and Christian scriptures acknowledge the reality of human sinfulness. However, only in the person of Jesus Christ does the claim of absolute sinlessness stand, qualifying Him as the savior of humanity. Muslims and all people are therefore invited to come to the Living Jesus, who has the authority and power to forgive sins and grant eternal life.ReferencesSahih Muslim, Book 35, Hadith 6522.

    "full_content": "Challenging the Omniscience of Allah: A Critical Theological AnalysisBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteAbstractThe Islamic doctrine traditionally asserts that Allah is omniscient, possessing perfect and complete knowledge of all things, past, present, and future. However, certain passages in the Quran, when examined critically and in their Arabic context, appear to suggest a process of discovery or testing on Allah’s part, implying limits to His knowledge. This paper scrutinizes these verses, especiallySurah al-Baqarah 2:143, and corroborating statements from Sahih Hadith, to interrogate the classical claim of Allah’s omniscience. The analysis situates the discussion within broader Abrahamic theology, comparing the Quranic depiction of divine knowledge with the biblical and Christian tradition.IntroductionThe nature of God’s knowledge is central to the theology of monotheistic religions. While the Bible affirms the omniscience of YHWH (Psalm 139:1–6; Hebrews 4:13), Islamic orthodoxy asserts the same for Allah. Nevertheless, critical examination of the Quran reveals verses that may undermine this doctrine. This article focuses on such instances, raising important questions about the consistency and coherence of Allah's omniscience as presented in Islamic scripture and hadith.1. Quranic Passages Suggesting a Lack of Omniscience1.1 Surah al-Baqarah 2:143The verse states:“We decreed the Qiblah which you faced before, that We may know who follows the Apostle and who turn away in haste…”(Quran 2:143, Ahmed Ali translation)The Arabic:“…وَمَا جَعَلْنَا الْقِبْلَةَ الَّتِي كُنتَ عَلَيْهَا إِلَّا لِنَعْلَمَ مَن يَتَّبِعُ الرَّسُولَ مِمَّن يَنقَلِبُ عَلَىٰ عَقِبَيْهِ…”Critical Analysis:The expression“لِنَعْلَمَ”(“so that We may know”) indicates a purpose clause. The plain reading suggests that Allah needed tocreate a test in order to gain knowledge—knowledge He would not otherwise have had. This language implies a form ofepistemic limitationon Allah’s part, which stands in contrast to the doctrine of exhaustive foreknowledge.1.2 Similar Passages in the QuranQuran 3:140:“…so that Allah may know those who believe…”Quran 29:2-3:“Do men think that they will be left alone on saying, ‘We believe’, and that they will not be tested? We did test those before them, so that Allah may know those who are true and those who are false.”In each case, the verb“يَعْلَمَ”(“may know”) is used in a manner that indicates discovery after a process, not prior omniscience.2. Interpretations from Classical TafsirMany classical Muslim exegetes (mufassirun) attempt to resolve this apparent theological problem. Al-Tabari, Ibn Kathir, and others argue that “so that We may know” is to be understoodmetaphorically, meaning “so that it may be known” to others or “so that it becomes manifest.” However, this is atheological glossand not the most immediate sense of the Arabic phrase. The Quran’s repeated use oftesting for knowledgeremains problematic.3. Evidence from Sahih Hadith3.1 Allah’s Regret or SurpriseSahih al-Bukhari 6619:“Allah wonders at those people who will enter Paradise in chains.”Here, Allah “wonders,” a term implying surprise or lack of foreknowledge.Sahih Muslim 2751:“Allah laughs at two men, one of whom kills the other yet both enter Paradise.”Laughter and wonder, in this anthropomorphic sense, are not typically attributed to an omniscient being in classical theism.4. Comparison with the Christian TraditionThe Christian Bible repeatedly affirms God’s perfect knowledge:Psalm 147:5:“Great is our Lord and mighty in power; his understanding has no limit.”1 John 3:20:“…God is greater than our heart, and He knows everything.”Unlike the Quran, there is no verse in the New Testament or Old Testament where Godtests in order to learnsomething previously unknown to Him.5. Academic DiscussionModern Islamic scholars (see: Fazlur Rahman, “Major Themes of the Quran”; W.M. Watt, “Islamic Philosophy and Theology”) admit that anthropomorphic language is present in the Quran, but tend to allegorize it. Nonetheless, such approaches raise questions abouttextual clarityanddoctrinal consistency.ConclusionBased on the evidence presented, the Quran and certain Sahih Hadith contain passages that, at leastprima facie, suggest Allah acquires knowledge through tests and events. While Islamic tradition strives to harmonize these with divine omniscience, the explicit wording remains challenging for the doctrine of Allah’s absolute knowledge. In contrast, the Christian scriptural portrayal of divine omniscience is unambiguous and consistent.References & BibliographyThe Holy Quran(trans.

    "full_content": "A Critical Examination of Prophethood in Light of Biblical and Islamic ClaimsBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba | Max Shimba Ministries Org.AbstractThis article examines the prophetic claims of Muhammad in contrast with biblical prophets. While all biblical prophets had direct encounters and conversations with God, the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, according to Islamic sources and the Qur’an, never claimed a direct conversation with Allah. Instead, his call to prophethood is rooted in psychological experiences and familial assurance, particularly from his wife, Khadija. This paper analyzes Islamic texts and compares Muhammad’s experience with the biblical paradigm of authentic prophethood, concluding with a call to re-examine the basis of Muhammad’s authority.IntroductionThroughout history, the role of a prophet has carried profound religious and spiritual significance. The biblical tradition, both Old and New Testament, affirms that true prophets have a direct encounter or dialogue with God (cf. Exodus 3:1–21; 1 Kings 19; Acts 18:9). However, the claim of Muhammad as a prophet in Islam raises critical questions, especially when contrasted with the prophetic narratives of the Bible. This paper revisits these claims and scrutinizes the basis of Muhammad’s prophethood using both Islamic and Christian sources.The Meaning of the Word “Prophet”The Swahili term“mtume”is derived from the concept of a “messenger” or “one who is sent.” In biblical context, an apostle or prophet is not only sent by God but also engages in direct communion with the Divine (see Exodus 3:4; 1 Samuel 3:4; Isaiah 6:8). This standard of direct encounter forms a critical criterion for authentic prophethood.Muhammad’s Prophetic Experience: An Analysis1. Muhammad Was Not Sent by GodThere is no verse in the Qur’an that unequivocally states Muhammad spoke directly with Allah, the one who allegedly appointed him as a prophet.[1] Unlike Moses, Elijah, or Paul—each of whom had direct divine conversations (Exodus 3:1–21; 1 Kings 19; Acts 18:9)—Muhammad’s revelations came through intermediary experiences, most notably the angel Jibril (Gabriel), and never a personal encounter with Allah.2. Muhammad Was Appointed by His WifeIslamic tradition reports that following his first revelatory experiences in the cave of Hira, Muhammad returned home in terror and confusion, fearing for his sanity and well-being. It was Khadija, his wife, who reassured him, allegedly declaring,“Rejoice, O son of my uncle, and be of good heart. By Him in whose hand is Khadija’s soul, I hope that you will be the Prophet of this people.”(Ibn Ishaq, Sirat Rasul Allah)Thus, Muhammad’s prophethood was initially affirmed by familial encouragement rather than a direct, public commission from God.3. Muhammad’s Experiences with Demonic ForcesIslamic sources themselves narrate that Muhammad was plagued by experiences that he interpreted as being under the influence of evil spirits (jinn or shayatin) from childhood and during his first “revelation.”Born with Satan:Abu Huraira narrated that, “The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) was accompanied by a devil since his birth…”(Fath al-Bari, Volume 6, p. 389)Tormented by Spirits:After his first experience in the cave, Muhammad was reported to have said,“I fear for myself, I am afraid that something may happen to me,”and fell into convulsions and fever, fearing possession by demons.(Kitab al-Kubra an-Nisa, p. 12)The Biblical Model: Prophets Who Spoke With GodAll authentic prophets in the biblical narrative spoke with God directly:Moses: Spoke with God face to face (Exodus 3:1–21).Elijah: Dialogued with God on Mount Horeb (1 Kings 19).Paul: The risen Christ appeared and spoke to him (Acts 18:9).No biblical prophet received their commission through mere intermediaries or through psychological crises alone.Critical Questions for Islamic ProphethoodIf Muhammad never spoke directly with Allah, how can his prophetic authority be substantiated? What is the basis of his calling? How can one trust a messenger who was plagued by doubts and fears, whose prophetic claim was affirmed by his wife rather than God?ConclusionThe evidence from both the Qur’an and Islamic traditions themselves casts serious doubt on the legitimacy of Muhammad’s prophethood when compared to the biblical model. The absence of direct communication with God, psychological disturbances, and familial affirmation rather than divine calling are issues that must be addressed by those who seek truth. Christians are called to place their faith in Jesus Christ—the Living and Supreme God—who has spoken clearly in history.ReferencesQur’an: Nowhere does the Qur’an record a direct conversation between Muhammad and Allah.Ibn Ishaq, Sirat Rasul Allah: The earliest biography of Muhammad, reports the reassurance given by Khadija.Fath al-Bari(فتح الباري), Commentary on Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 6, p. 389.Kitab al-Kubra an-Nisa(كتاب الكبرى النساء), p. 12.The Bible:Exodus 3:1–21 (Moses and God)1 Kings 19 (Elijah and God)Acts 18:9 (Paul and God)Sahih al-Bukhari: Collection of hadithsThe Holy Qur’an: Multiple translations and tafsirIbn Sa’d, Kitab al-Tabaqat al-Kabir: Early Islamic biographyW.

    "full_content": "Journal of Comparative Theology and Islamic StudiesVol. XX, No. X, 2025, pp. XX-XXClarity and Ambiguity in the Qur’an: Theological Tension and Interpretive InconsistencyDr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis article examines the internal tensions within the Qur’an concerning its self-proclaimed clarity and its simultaneous acknowledgement of ambiguity. Through a close reading of Qur’an 54:17 and Qur’an 3:7, and engagement with classical and contemporary exegesis, the study investigates the implications of these apparent inconsistencies for Islamic hermeneutics, theology, and religious epistemology. The article concludes that the Qur’anic text maintains a dynamic but unresolved tension between universality and mystery, which fundamentally shapes its interpretive tradition and its claims to religious authority.IntroductionThe Qur’an’s unique status as the central scripture of Islam hinges on its perceived clarity and role as a universal guide. However, a close reading of the Qur’an reveals a significant hermeneutical tension: the text repeatedly claims accessibility and ease of understanding (Qur’an 54:17), yet simultaneously attests to the presence of ambiguous verses whose meanings are known only to God (Qur’an 3:7). This article critically examines the nature and impact of this tension, arguing that the Qur’anic discourse on clarity and ambiguity is both a theological challenge and a driving force behind Islamic interpretive diversity.Qur’anic Self-Characterization: Clear or Ambiguous?Qur’an 54:17 states: “And We have certainly made the Qur’an easy to remember, so is there anyone who will be mindful?” This assertion, repeated several times throughout Surah al-Qamar (54:22, 32, 40), suggests that the Qur’an is both pedagogically accessible and intended for universal comprehension. The language of “ease” (yassarnā) and “remembrance” (dhikr) underscores a scriptural ideal: a text meant for internalization and practical application by all believers.Yet, the narrative shifts in Qur’an 3:7:“It is He Who has sent down to you the Book; in it are verses that are precise—they are the foundation of the Book—and others unspecific. As for those in whose hearts is deviation, they will follow that of it which is unspecific, seeking discord and seeking an interpretation [suitable to them]. And no one knows its [true] interpretation except Allah. But those firm in knowledge say, ‘We believe in it. All is from our Lord.’”Here, the Qur’an distinguishes between “muhkam” (clear and decisive) verses and “mutashābih” (ambiguous or allegorical) verses, introducing a paradigm wherein some scriptural content is intentionally left obscure. The implications are profound: whereas the former set of verses constitutes the “mother of the Book” (umm al-kitāb), the latter set is regarded as a potential source of fitna (discord) when pursued with ulterior motives.The Exegetical Tradition: Navigating AmbiguityClassical tafsir literature is replete with discussions concerning the nature of these ambiguous verses. Early exegetes such as Al-Tabari (d. 923) and Ibn Kathir (d. 1373) maintain that while the core theological and legal teachings of the Qur’an are manifest, certain metaphysical matters (e.g., descriptions of God, eschatological imagery) are deliberately veiled, serving as a test of faith and interpretive discipline (Tabari,Tafsir, on 3:7; Ibn Kathir,Tafsir al-Qur’an al-‘Azim). The Ash‘ari and Mu‘tazili schools offered distinct hermeneutical strategies—ranging from literal affirmation without modality (bi-la kayf) to extensive metaphorization—thereby engendering diversity, and at times, controversy within Islamic thought (Watt, 1973).Contemporary scholars, such as Fazlur Rahman (1980) and Abdullah Saeed (2006), contend that this dynamic reflects both the universalizing ambitions of the Qur’an and its preservation of divine mystery. Rahman asserts that the Qur’an’s message is, in principle, comprehensible to all, but that certain passages necessarily transcend human cognition due to their metaphysical subject matter. Saeed emphasizes that the category of mutashābih serves to both invite interpretive humility and safeguard doctrinal orthodoxy.Theological and Epistemological RamificationsThe juxtaposition of clarity and ambiguity within the Qur’an has generated significant debate concerning religious epistemology and authority. If the Qur’an is both clear and cryptic, to what extent can the individual believer be held accountable for their interpretation? Can theological pluralism be justified on the basis of scriptural ambiguity, or does this undermine claims to objective religious truth? Critics—both within and outside the Islamic tradition—have argued that this duality is sometimes invoked apologetically to avoid difficult questions or to neutralize interpretive dissent (Bucaille, 1976; Wansbrough, 1977).Furthermore, the ambiguity inherent in the Qur’anic text has contributed to the proliferation of divergent sectarian readings—most notably between Sunni, Shi‘a, and Sufi traditions—each laying claim to the “clear” message while accusing others of exploiting ambiguity for polemical ends (Ayoub, 1984).ConclusionThe Qur’an’s simultaneous assertion of clarity and admission of ambiguity is not merely a rhetorical device, but a constitutive feature of its textual and theological identity. This unresolved tension has inspired both a rich exegetical tradition and enduring controversy. Ultimately, the Qur’an presents itself as a text to be approached with both intellectual engagement and epistemic humility. Its claim to universality, juxtaposed with its admitted mystery, ensures that interpretation will remain a perennial endeavor within the Islamic tradition.ReferencesThe Qur’an (Translations: Yusuf Ali, Pickthall, Saheeh International)Al-Tabari,Jāmiʿ al-bayān fī taʾwīl āy al-QurʾānIbn Kathir,Tafsir al-Qur’an al-‘AzimFazlur Rahman,Major Themes of the Qur’an.

Tukio hili limejadiliwa na wanazuoni wa Kiislamu na wasio Waislamu kutokana na uzito na athari zake katika mafundisho kuhusu isma (kutokukosea kwa manabii) na dhana ya usafi wa ndani wa Mtume.Taarifa ya Kihistoria kuhusu Upasuaji wa Mtume MuhammadKwa mujibu wa masimulizi yaliyopokewa na Anas bin Malik na kuandikwa katika Sahih Muslim (Juzuu ya 1, uk. 147, hadithi namba 713), inasimuliwa kuwa Mtume Muhammad alipasuliwa mara nne tofauti:Mara ya kwanza, akiwa na umri wa miaka mitatu.Mara ya pili, akiwa na umri wa miaka kumi.Mara ya tatu, akiwa na umri wa miaka arobaini.Mara ya nne, alipokuwa anaandaliwa kwa tukio la Israa, akiwa na umri wa miaka arobaini na tatu.Katika simulizi hili, Anas bin Malik anaeleza:“Mtume wa Allah (s.a.w) alikuwa akicheza pamoja na watoto. Malaika Jibril (a.s) alimfikia, akamchukua na kumtupa chini, akapasua kifua chake, akauchukua moyo wake, akatoa ndani yake kipande cha damu na kusema: ‘Hii ni sehemu ya shetani (nimeitoa) kutoka kwako.’ Kisha akaosha moyo wake katika chombo cha dhahabu kilichokuwa na maji ya Zamzam, akaurudisha na kuufunga mahali pake.”Maswali ya Kitaaluma Yanayoibuka:Sehemu hii ya shetani iliingiaje kwenye moyo wa Muhammad?Tukio hili linaibua hoja kuhusu hali ya kiroho na usafi wa Mtume kabla ya upasuaji, jambo linaloweza kuathiri dhana ya utakatifu na ulinzi wa manabii katika Uislamu.Tangu lini shetani anasafishwa kwa maji?Dhima ya kutumia maji ya Zamzam kama njia ya kumsafisha shetani inatia shaka kimantiki na kimafundisho. Inapingana na imani za kidini kuhusu asili ya shetani kama roho na siyo uchafu wa mwili unaoweza kuoshwa.Ulinganisho na Hadithi kuhusu Yesu (Isa bin Mariam):Katika hadithi nyingine iliyosimuliwa na Abu Huraira, Mtume Muhammad alisema:“Kila mwanadamu anapozaliwa, shetani huingia katika mbavu zake kwa vidole vyake, isipokuwa Isa bin Mariam. Alijaribu kumwingia lakini akakuta pazia.”(Sahih Bukhari na Sahih Muslim)Hadithi hii inamtaja Yesu pekee kama asiyeweza kuguswa na shetani tangu kuzaliwa, akimpiku hata Muhammad katika hali ya utakatifu.HitimishoMasimulizi haya yanaleta changamoto kubwa katika teolojia ya Kiislamu kuhusu dhana ya utakatifu wa manabii na mbinu za kuondoa ushawishi wa shetani. Pia, yanaleta ulinganisho wa moja kwa moja kati ya Yesu na Muhammad, ambapo Yesu anaonekana kuwa na cheo cha kipekee katika usafi wa kiroho.Imeandikwa na: Max Shimba, mtumwa wa Yesu KristoKwa ajili ya Max Shimba Ministries OrgMAX SHIMBA MINISTRIES ORG ©2016.

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute | Max Shimba Ministries Org ©20161. Muhammad Attempted Suicide2. Muhammad Climbed Mountains to Throw Himself Off3. Aisha Testifies Muhammad Was BewitchedDear Reader,As we study the Holy Bible, we find that God appointed His prophets and messengers out of love and grace. However, when I examined Islamic scriptures and historical sources related to the prophet Muhammad, I encountered very disturbing reports, particularly concerning his mental state and supernatural experiences. I will now present Islamic sources directly so that Muslims cannot claim I am misrepresenting their texts.I. MUHAMMAD ATTEMPTED SUICIDE DUE TO SPIRITUAL DISTRESSAccording toSahih al-Bukhari, after the first revelatory experience, Muhammad was deeply disturbed and attempted to commit suicide due to the suspension of revelation (wahy). He climbed to the top of mountains intending to throw himself off:“The Prophet said: ‘Will they expel me?’ … Later, after Waraqa bin Nawfal passed away, the revelation stopped for a time, and Muhammad became so distressed that he would go to the top of mountain peaks to throw himself off. But each time he reached the summit, the Angel Jibril would appear and reassure him saying: ‘You are truly the Messenger of Allah.’ Then he would calm down and return home. But when the period of silence lengthened, he would repeat the attempt.”(Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 9, Book of Interpretation, Hadith 6982)Question: Where in the Torah, Psalms, or Gospel do we ever read of any biblical prophet attempting suicide as Muhammad did?II. MUHAMMAD’S SUICIDAL TENDENCIES RECURRED MULTIPLE TIMESThe narration reveals that these suicidal attempts occurred repeatedly whenever divine revelation ceased:“The Prophet became so sorrowful due to the cessation of revelation that he repeatedly climbed mountaintops to throw himself off. But whenever he reached the peak, Jibril would appear and say, ‘Indeed, you are the true Messenger of Allah,’ which would calm him down…”(Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 8, Book of Invocations, p. 234)This repeated behavior reflects profound emotional instability that is alarming, especially for someone considered a prophet of God.III. AISHA CLAIMS MUHAMMAD WAS BEWITCHEDEven more concerning is the testimony of Aisha, Muhammad’s favorite wife, who claimed he was under a magical spell:“Narrated Aisha: Allah’s Messenger was bewitched to the extent that he believed he had done things which he had not done. One day, he prayed to Allah, and then said: ‘O Aisha, do you know that Allah has answered me concerning what I asked Him?’”(Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 8, Book of Medicine, Hadith 6391)Aisha confirms that Muhammad was deluded, thinking he had sexual relations with his wives when he had not. This aligns with another narration:“The Prophet remained under the effect of that spell for several days, believing he had approached his wives though he had not.”(Al-Furqan 25)How is it possible that a prophet of Allah could be bewitched while the all-powerful Allah looked on and did nothing?IV. MUHAMMAD DECLARED HIMSELF INSANEAnother disturbing confession from Muhammad is found inKitab al-Tabaqat al-Kabirby Ibn Sa’d:“O Khadijah, I see lights and hear voices. I fear I am mad (possessed or insane).”(Kitab al-Tabaqat al-Kabir, translated by S. Moinul Haq, Vol. 1, p. 225)In some translations, he is quoted as saying: “I fear I am going mad.”Could this fear have been rooted in the traumatic experience of his first “revelation,” where he was seized and violently pressed by a being in the cave?V. MUHAMMAD’S FIRST ENCOUNTER: TRAUMA OR REVELATION?InThe Life of Prophet Muhammadby Sheikh Abdullah Saleh Al-Farsy (pp. 16–17), we read about Muhammad’s first encounter with what he later believed to be the angel Jibril:“One day, during the month of Ramadan (17th, on a Monday, in the 40½th year of his life), the Prophet saw a man standing before him. He said, ‘Read!’ The Prophet replied, ‘I do not know how to read.’ The man seized him, pressed him hard, and repeated: ‘Read!’ This happened three times before the man recited the verses of Surah al-Alaq (96), which Muhammad then memorized. Frightened, he returned home. Khadija thought he had a fever and covered him. After he calmed down, he told her everything. She went to her cousin Waraqa bin Nawfal, who confirmed that Muhammad had seen the same angel who appeared to Moses and Jesus.”This traumatic experience suggests not peaceful divine inspiration, but an oppressive and fearful encounter, inconsistent with biblical revelation.VI. ACCORDING TO ANOTHER SOURCE, MUHAMMAD WAS TEMPTED BY SATAN IN THE CAVEAccording toWives and Children of the Prophet, also by Sheikh Abdullah Saleh Al-Farsy (p. 12), it is suggested that Muhammad may have been subjected to satanic manipulation during his early experiences in the cave.BIBLICAL PERSPECTIVE ON SUICIDEAccording to the Bible, suicide is never a prophetic characteristic. The act of taking one’s own life is condemned as self-murder, a violation of God's sovereign authority over life and death.The Bible mentions four individuals who committed suicide:Saul–1 Samuel 31:4Ahithophel–2 Samuel 17:23Zimri–1 Kings 16:18Judas Iscariot–Matthew 27:5Each of these men was wicked or spiritually compromised. Suicide in Scripture is a grave sin, and those who die without salvation face eternal judgment (Revelation 21:8).CONCLUSIONNow, to all Muslims: Show me in the Torah, the Psalms, or the Gospels, any prophet who attempted to commit suicide like Muhammad, or was bewitched, or confessed madness. Such attributes are not characteristics of God’s prophets as revealed in the Bible.The invitation stands: Come toJesus Christ, who is theWay, the Truth, and the Life(John 14:6). No prophet, no angel, no vision compares to the living Son of God.May the Lord bless you.Dr. Maxwell ShimbaServant of Jesus ChristShimba Theological InstituteMax Shimba Ministries Org ©2016.

    "full_content": "Title:The Theological Inconsistencies in Muhammad’s Claim of Chaining a Demon: A Critical Examination of Sahih al-Bukhari 3423By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis scholarly investigation critically evaluates the hadith inSahih al-Bukhari 3423, in which Muhammad claims he captured a strong demon (ifrit) during prayer and nearly chained it to a pillar of the mosque for public viewing. Drawing from Quranic texts, Islamic hadith literature, and theological logic, this paper questions the plausibility and spiritual value of such an event. It examines the theological motivations behind the narration, the implications for Islamic doctrine on jinn, and whether such claims reflect authentic spiritual authority or imaginative narratives.IntroductionInSahih al-Bukhari 3423, Muhammad is quoted as claiming he overpowered an ifrit (a powerful rebellious jinn) during his prayer, with the intent to tie it to a mosque pillar so others might witness it. He later states he released it out of deference to the prayer of Solomon inQur’an 38:35. This episode raises numerous theological concerns regarding the nature of jinn, the purpose of such an encounter, and whether such experiences serve divine purposes or promote mythologized self-glorification.1.The Claim of Binding a Demon: A Theological AnalysisMuhammad’s claim that he was able to physically subdue and bind a jinn (demon) contradicts both Islamic and biblical precedent concerning spiritual hierarchies and the unseen realm. InQur’an 38:35, Solomon asks Allah for a kingdom “not befitting anyone after me,” which included dominion over jinn. Muhammad, by invoking this verse, inadvertently places himself in tension with Solomon’s exclusive request.If Solomon's authority over jinn was a unique divine endowment, then Muhammad’s ability to overpower and display a demon would violate that exclusivity, undermining the Quran’s assertion of Solomon’s unparalleled kingship. Therefore, Muhammad’s release of the demon not out of mercy or spiritual discernment but seemingly to preserve the uniqueness of Solomon’s prayer appears forced and theologically inconsistent.Moreover, the idea of chaining a spiritual being so it becomes visible to physical eyes contradicts the Islamic doctrine that jinn areghayb(unseen), as confirmed inQur’an 7:27:“Indeed, he (Satan) sees you, he and his tribe, from where you do not see them.”This raises the logical problem: if jinn are by nature invisible to human perception, then binding one to a pillar for public viewing suggests either a miraculous materialization (which Muhammad does not claim), or fabrication.2.Spiritual Gain: What Would Seeing a Demon Accomplish?The supposed public display of a chained demon in the mosque lacks theological or redemptive purpose. In both Judeo-Christian and Islamic traditions, signs and wonders are meant to inspire faith, repentance, or divine awe. Displaying a demon, a cursed entity, in a place of worship neither glorifies God nor edifies believers.Furthermore, Islam’s teachings abouttazkiyah(spiritual purification) and humility in worship contradict the sensationalism of exhibiting a captured demon. There is no precedent in the Quran or hadith where spiritual maturity is gained by physically seeing evil spirits. Rather, the focus is on resisting evil through prayer, fasting, and the remembrance of Allah.Hence, the question remains: what divine purpose would have been served by a mosque audience witnessing a chained ifrit? The answer appears to be none. The story seems more mythopoeic, bolstering Muhammad’s image as spiritually powerful rather than conveying a redemptive truth.3.Why Did Muhammad Encounter a Demon?According to the hadith, the demon came to “cut off” Muhammad’s prayer. However, this claim raises questions: if Muhammad was the most perfect of creation (al-insan al-kamil), and the one protected by Allah (ma’sum), why would Allah allow a jinn to attack him during such a holy act?The Quran teaches that the righteous are under divine protection:“Indeed, My servants – no authority will you have over them, except those who follow you of the deviators.”(Qur’an 15:42)So either Muhammad was vulnerable to demonic interruption in prayer (contradicting divine protection), or the story is a fabricated spiritual legend intended to magnify Muhammad's supposed power over the unseen realm.4.Do Demons Attend Mosque Prayers?According to several Islamic traditions, jinn—including disbelieving ones—can infiltrate human spaces, including mosques.Sahih Muslim 540suggests that yawning in prayer is caused by Shaytan, and he \"laughs\" when one yawns. But the Quran consistently portrays mosques as places purified for Allah’s worship (Qur’an 72:18):“And the mosques are for Allah, so do not invoke anyone along with Allah.”If demons can attack prophets in a mosque, during prayer, then the theological premise that mosques are sacred, protected spaces is undermined.5.Are Demons from the Jinn?Islamic theology considers demons a subset of jinn. The Quran mentions that Iblis (Satan) was one of the jinn (Qur’an 18:50):“He was one of the jinn, and he rebelled against the command of his Lord.”Hence, “demon” and “jinn” in this context are nearly interchangeable, particularly when describing rebellious and harmful entities.6.Are Jinn Not Muslims? Contradictions in Islamic LiteratureThe Quran presents jinn as morally responsible beings capable of both faith and disbelief:“And among us are the righteous, and among us are [others] not so; we were [of] divided ways.”(Qur’an 72:11)“Say, it has been revealed to me that a group of the jinn listened and said, ‘Indeed, we have heard an amazing Quran.’”(Qur’an 72:1)Yet this creates internal theological tensions. If some jinn are Muslims, then depicting all jinn (or all ifrit) as inherently demonic is misleading. Moreover, the portrayal of an ifrit being bound like a circus animal for display contradicts the notion of jinn as free-willed and spiritually responsible agents.Conclusion:Muhammad’s claim of capturing a demon during prayer and nearly displaying it to his followers in the mosque is fraught with theological and logical inconsistencies. It undermines Islamic teachings on the uniqueness of Solomon’s dominion, the nature of the unseen realm, the sanctity of mosques, and the spiritual integrity of divine encounters. The story, rather than elevating Muhammad’s prophetic character, instead aligns more with myth-making—a self-aggrandizing narrative designed to bolster his spiritual prestige without offering any genuine theological or redemptive benefit to his followers.The inconsistency in the claim affirms that such narration is better understood as a fabrication, myth, or legend rather than an authentic act of divine authority.Dr. Maxwell ShimbaFounder, Shimba Theological Institute",

    "full_content": "The Enigma of the Messengers in Quran 36:14: A Critical Analysis of Divine Knowledge and Narrative ClarityBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractQuran 36:14 describes a divine episode in which Allah claims to have sent two, and subsequently a third, messenger to a certain city. Yet, the Quran offers no explicit identification of these individuals or the city in question, despite asserting its own clarity and completeness. This article critically examines the ambiguity of this narrative, interrogates the implications for the purported omniscience and communicative transparency of Allah, and contrasts this episode with the narrative standards of Biblical and historical prophetic literature. The analysis ultimately challenges the Quranic claim to clarity (Quran 12:1, 16:89, 41:3) and highlights significant epistemic and hermeneutical deficiencies.IntroductionAmong the central claims of the Quran is its position as a \"clear book\" (kitābun mubīn, Quran 12:1), a revelation in \"clear Arabic\" intended to be a comprehensive guide to mankind (Quran 16:89). Yet, a close reading of many Quranic passages reveals notable narrative ambiguities and omissions, most starkly illustrated in the account of the messengers sent to a city in Surah Ya-Sin (Quran 36:13–14). This article investigates the lacunae in this account, particularly the lack of explicit identification of the prophets and the city, and examines the implications for the Quran’s claim to clarity and divine omniscience.The Textual Problem: Quran 36:13–14The passage in question reads:\"And set out to them a parable: the dwellers of the city, when there came messengers to them. When We sent to them two, but they denied them both, so We strengthened them with a third. They said, 'Indeed, we are sent to you.'\"(Quran 36:13–14)Crucially, the Quran does not provide:The names of the messengers.The name of the city.The historical context or time period.This absence is remarkable given the Quran’s self-assertion astibyān li-kulli shayʾ(\"an explanation of all things,\" Quran 16:89).Traditional Exegesis: Attempts to Fill the GapsMuslim exegetes (mufassirūn) have long grappled with this vagueness. The majority, including classical authorities such as Ibn Kathir, Al-Tabari, and Al-Qurtubi, relay speculative traditions (Isra’iliyyat), often borrowing from Christian sources. Some suggest the city is Antioch, and the messengers are disciples of Jesus (Barnabas, Paul, Peter, John, etc.). However, the Quran itself is silent on these specifics, and these interpretations are neither unanimous nor rooted in Quranic text.The reliance on external, sometimes apocryphal, traditions raises methodological concerns:Why must the “clear book” rely on non-Quranic sources for clarification?Does this not betray a deficiency in the primary text?Comparative Analysis: Biblical and Prophetic NarrativesIn sharp contrast, the Biblical narrative—whether Old or New Testament—typically provides detailed accounts of prophets:Names (e.g., Moses, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Jesus).Geographic locations (Egypt, Israel, Nineveh, etc.).Chronological and social contexts.Such precision serves both historical and theological purposes, allowing for meaningful engagement and verifiability. The Quranic narrative in 36:14, by contrast, lacks these basic attributes of historical clarity.The Problem of Omniscience and ClarityIf Allah is omniscient and wishes to communicate guidance “clearly,” the omission of essential details is problematic:Epistemic Ambiguity:The absence of names and location renders the passage unanchored, open to endless speculation, and ultimately functionally ambiguous.Hermeneutical Uncertainty:The requirement for extraneous tradition to fill gaps undermines the sufficiency of revelation. As Rippin (2001) observes, “the act of interpretation in Islam is often an act of supplementing rather than explaining.”Theological Implications:If divine knowledge is perfect, why does revelation obscure rather than elucidate? If clarity is the standard, why this narrative reticence?Quranic Self-ContradictionThe Quran asserts,“This is a clear Book” (Quran 12:1),“We have not neglected in the Book a thing” (Quran 6:38),“We have explained in detail every kind of example for mankind” (Quran 17:89).Yet, in 36:14, it demonstrably neglects what would be considered essential narrative elements.Discussion: The Weakness of the Claim to ClarityThe Quran’s persistent vagueness in passages such as 36:14 raises serious challenges to the claim of its communicative clarity and, by extension, the scope and reliability of Allah’s knowledge as expressed in the text. The divine message, so vital for guidance, is instead presented as an enigmatic parable whose specifics are irretrievable without extra-Quranic interpolation.Scholarly CritiqueMichael Cook(The Koran: A Very Short Introduction, 2000) notes the Quran’s “tendency to allude rather than narrate,” which renders much of its content inaccessible without prior knowledge or external sources.Gabriel Said Reynolds(The Qur’an and Its Biblical Subtext, 2010) identifies this as a deliberate, if problematic, literary technique, one that often frustrates genuine understanding.ConclusionQuran 36:14 serves as a paradigmatic example of the epistemological and communicative weakness inherent in the Quranic revelation. By failing to identify the very individuals and city at the heart of the story, the Quran undermines its claim to clarity and completeness. This exposes an internal contradiction and questions the efficacy of divine knowledge as transmitted in the Islamic scripture.Unless one is prepared to accept that the divine message is intentionally obscurantist, the logical inference is that Allah’s knowledge—at least as rendered in the Quran—is insufficiently clear, leaving the purportedly guided audience in ambiguity rather than certainty.ReferencesThe Quran (36:13–14, 12:1, 16:89, 41:3, 6:38, 17:89)Al-Tabari,Tafsir al-TabariIbn Kathir,Tafsir al-Quran al-AzimMichael Cook,The Koran: A Very Short Introduction(Oxford, 2000)Gabriel Said Reynolds,The Qur’an and Its Biblical Subtext(Routledge, 2010)Andrew Rippin,The Blackwell Companion to the Qur’an(Blackwell, 2001)The Bible (various references)Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThe divinity of Jesus Christ is one of the central doctrines of historic Christianity and a frequent point of contention in Christian-Muslim dialogue. This article explores, from a scholarly perspective, the biblical evidence for Jesus' explicit and implicit claims to be God, considering key texts from both the Gospels and the broader New Testament. The analysis further addresses common misunderstandings and responds to critical objections raised by alternative religious perspectives, especially within Islamic theology.IntroductionThe question of whether Jesus of Nazareth explicitly claimed divinity is not only a matter of theological import but also of historical and exegetical significance. While some critics argue that Jesus never identified Himself as God, a closer examination of the biblical texts reveals a robust tapestry of self-identification that is consistent with divine status. This article evaluates the primary texts where Jesus either directly or indirectly claimed to be God and examines their implications for Christian doctrine.1.Direct Claims of Divinitya) The “I Am” SayingsPerhaps the most profound claim comes from Jesus’ use of the phrase “I am” (Greek: ἐγώ εἰμι,ego eimi)—a direct allusion to the divine name revealed to Moses in Exodus 3:14 (“I AM WHO I AM”). In John 8:58, Jesus declares, “Before Abraham was, I am.” This utterance, which echoes the Septuagint rendering of the divine name, prompted the Jews to attempt to stone Him for blasphemy, recognizing His claim to deity (John 8:59).b) Revelation: The Alpha and OmegaThe book of Revelation records Jesus as saying, “I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End” (Rev 22:13). These titles are used in the Old Testament for Yahweh alone (cf. Isaiah 44:6), demonstrating that the risen Christ ascribes to Himself attributes of eternality and sovereignty unique to God. Furthermore, in Revelation 1:8, Jesus says, “I am the Almighty,” a term that in the Greek (παντοκράτωρ,pantokrator) denotes absolute omnipotence.2.Jesus’ Functional Equality with Goda) Authority Over Life and JudgmentJesus claims to be the source of life and the final judge. In John 11:25, He says, “I am the resurrection and the life.” In John 5:22-23, He asserts that the Father “has entrusted all judgment to the Son, that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father.” Such statements equate Jesus’ prerogatives with those belonging to God alone (cf. Deut 32:39; 1 Sam 2:6).b) The Giver of Eternal LifeIn John 10:28, Jesus says, “I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish.” The power to grant eternal life is repeatedly ascribed to God in the Old Testament (cf. Psalm 36:9). Jesus’ self-ascription here again demonstrates His divine prerogative.3.Identification with God’s Unique Titles and Functionsa) “The Truth, the Life, the Light”In John 14:6, Jesus affirms, “I am the way, the truth, and the life.” In John 8:12, He states, “I am the light of the world.” The Old Testament depicts Yahweh as the source of light (Psalm 27:1), life (Deut 30:20), and truth (Isaiah 65:16).b) Worship and Prayer Directed to JesusThe Gospels and the wider New Testament record Jesus receiving worship (Matthew 14:33; 28:9, 17; John 20:28) and prayers (Acts 7:59-60; 1 Corinthians 1:2)—honor reserved for God alone (Exodus 34:14; Isaiah 42:8).4.Jesus as “The Son of Man” and Daniel 7:13–14In Daniel 7:13–14, the “Son of Man” receives worship and an eternal kingdom—roles ascribed to God alone. Jesus appropriates this title for Himself throughout the Synoptic Gospels, and before the Sanhedrin affirms that He is the eschatological Son of Man who will come “on the clouds of heaven” (Mark 14:61-64), leading to His condemnation for blasphemy.5.Response to Islamic ObjectionsMuslim apologists frequently argue that Jesus never said “I am God, worship Me” in those exact words. However, the biblical pattern is one of indirect and culturally appropriate self-revelation, mirroring the theophanic communications of God in the Old Testament. Furthermore, Jesus’ self-identification, authority, and reception of worship are tantamount to clear claims to deity within the context of Second Temple Judaism.ConclusionThe cumulative weight of the biblical evidence affirms that Jesus did not merely claim to be a prophet or a moral teacher but uniquely identified Himself with the God of Israel. The explicit and implicit claims to divine status, the ascription of divine prerogatives, the acceptance of worship, and the fulfillment of Old Testament theophanic imagery all substantiate the historic Christian confession:Jesus is God manifest in the flesh(John 1:1, 14; 1 Timothy 3:16). Any denial of this reality fails to account for the full witness of the New Testament documents and the earliest Christian testimony.ReferencesBauckham, R. (2008).Jesus and the God of Israel.

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionOne of the most frequently asked questions by Islamic scholars and adherents is:How can Jesus be the Son of God?How can God have a Son without a wife?These questions arise from misunderstandings about the Christian doctrine of the Sonship of Jesus. In this exposition, we shall clarify the true theological meaning of \"Son of God\" as applied to Jesus Christ, referencing the Christian Scriptures and contrasting the misunderstandings often presented in Islamic polemics.1. How is Jesus the Son of God?To begin, it must be categorically stated that Jesus Christ is not the \"Son of God\" in the ordinary, biological sense, as would be understood in human parenthood. This doesnotmean that God married and had a male child. Christians categorically reject any suggestion that God had sexual relations with Mary, resulting in the birth of Jesus—a notion sometimes implied in Islamic critiques. Rather, the title \"Son of God\" expresses a unique, spiritual, and eternal relationship between Jesus and God the Father, rooted in divine revelation and not in physical generation.John 1:1, 14states:\"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God... The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us.\"Here, \"the Word\" (Logos) refers to Jesus, who existed eternally with God and became incarnate.2. How Can God Have a Son Without a Wife?This question misunderstands the Christian teaching. The New Testament affirms that Jesus is the Son of God not by physical procreation, but by divine action through the Holy Spirit. The angelic announcement to Mary inLuke 1:35is explicit:\"The angel answered, 'The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. Therefore the holy one to be born will be called the Son of God.'\" (NIV)Mary did not conceive Jesus through any natural human process but by the supernatural intervention of the Holy Spirit, who is fully God. Thus, Jesus is called \"holy\" and \"the Son of God\" by the angel, a unique title denoting both his divine origin and his unique relationship to God the Father.3. Jesus Affirms His Identity as the Son of GodDuring his trial before the Jewish religious leaders, the high priest directly challenged Jesus:\"The high priest said to him, 'I charge you under oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.' 'Yes, it is as you say,' Jesus replied. 'But I say to all of you: In the future you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.'\"(Matthew 26:63-64, NIV)Jesus didnotdeny being the Son of God. On the contrary, he affirmed it, even invokingDaniel 7:13-14regarding the Son of Man's divine authority—provoking a charge of blasphemy from the Jewish leaders.4. The Jewish Understanding of \"Son of God\"Later, before the Roman governor Pilate, the Jewish leaders insisted:\"The Jews insisted, 'We have a law, and according to that law he must die, because he claimed to be the Son of God.'\"(John 19:7, NIV)For the Jews, Jesus’ claim to be the \"Son of God\" was not understood as a metaphor or a mere honorific title. It signified equality with God—an assertion of divinity. This is further emphasized inJohn 5:18:\"For this reason the Jews tried all the harder to kill him; not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God.\"Thus, to claim to be the Son of God, in this context, meant to claim a unique, divine status—hence the charge of blasphemy and the demand for Jesus’ execution.5. The Theological Meaning of \"Son of God\"The New Testament further clarifies the meaning of \"Son of God.\"Hebrews 1:3describes Jesus as:\"The radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful word. After he had provided purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty in heaven.\"This passage highlights both the divinity and the preexistence of Jesus as the Son of God, affirming his unique relationship and essential unity with the Father.To understand the term \"Son of God\" in the biblical sense is to recognize that Jesus is the perfect, visible manifestation of the invisible God (Colossians 1:15;John 14:9). The title does not imply literal offspring, but rather a relationship of shared essence, authority, and mission.6. Analogy: \"Son of Perdition\" and Biblical IdiomsA further clarification can be found in biblical idioms. InJohn 17:12, Judas Iscariot is referred to as \"the son of perdition\" (or \"son of destruction\"). This does not mean Judas was literally born from \"destruction\" as a parent, but rather that his life and actions embodied destruction. Similarly, to be \"the Son of God\" is to embody the character and essence of God.7. Jesus as God Revealed in FleshUltimately, the doctrine of the Sonship of Jesus is inseparable from the doctrine of the Incarnation: God revealed in human flesh.John 1:1, 14again affirms: \"The Word was God... and the Word became flesh.\" This mystery is foundational to Christian faith.ConclusionThe question \"How can Jesus be the Son of God?\" is resolved by understanding that the Christian claim is not of biological paternity, but of an eternal, spiritual relationship—God manifesting Himself in the person of Jesus Christ, uniquely begotten, not made, of one essence with the Father (Nicene Creed). This truth is attested by Scripture, proclaimed by Jesus Himself, and understood by his followers as the foundation of Christian faith.ReferencesThe Holy Bible, New International Version (NIV)John 1:1, 14; John 5:18; John 17:12; John 19:7Luke 1:35Matthew 26:63-66Daniel 7:13-14Hebrews 1:3Colossians 1:15The Nicene CreedBibliographyCarson, D.

This article examines points of perceived similarity between non-theism (often associated with atheism and secular humanism) and Islam (as represented in classical Islamic doctrine and selected interpretations). The intent is to foster rigorous academic dialogue, rather than to incite polemic, by carefully interrogating claims and providing a balanced perspective informed by both religious texts and scholarly analysis.Exhibit 1: Denial of the Existence of GodClaim:Both non-theists and Muslims deny the existence of the true God.IslamIslam asserts strict monotheism (tawhid), expressed in the Shahada: “There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah” (Qur’an 3:18). However, from a Christian theological perspective, the Islamic concept of God (Allah) is considered distinct from the biblical Triune God (cf. Deuteronomy 6:4; Matthew 28:19).Reference:The Qur’an 3:18, 112:1–4Partridge, C. (2013).Introduction to World Religions. Fortress Press.Non-theismNon-theism, particularly in its atheistic form, explicitly denies the existence of any deity (cf. Dawkins,The God Delusion, 2006).Reference:Dawkins, R. (2006).The God Delusion. Bantam.Scholarly Note:While Islam affirms the existence of Allah, non-theism categorically denies any deity. The claim of “denying the existence of God” requires clarification: Islam rejects the Christian concept of God but is not atheistic. Theological debates hinge on definitions of \"God\" (cf. Plantinga,God and Other Minds, 1967).Exhibit 2: Beliefs About EvolutionClaim:Both non-theists and Muslims support a form of evolution linking humans to primates.IslamSome interpretations of the Qur’an reference transformations as divine punishments, e.g., “those who transgressed were turned into apes and pigs” (Qur’an 2:65, 5:60, 7:166). Classical exegesis treats these as miraculous punishments, not evolutionary claims.Reference:The Qur’an 2:65, 5:60, 7:166Ibn Kathir,Tafsir al-Qur’an al-Azim.Non-theismModern non-theism often accepts Darwinian evolution, which posits humans and primates share common ancestry (cf. Darwin,On the Origin of Species, 1859).Reference:Darwin, C. (1859).On the Origin of Species. John Murray.Scholarly Note:The “transformation” in Islamic scripture is a supernatural event, distinct from scientific evolution. Non-theism grounds its belief in materialistic evolution, while traditional Islam neither affirms nor denies Darwinism as doctrine.Exhibit 3: Racial Attitudes Toward Black AfricansClaim:Both non-theists and Muslims harbor negative attitudes toward Black Africans.IslamSome controversial hadiths attribute pejorative descriptions to Black Africans (see al-Tabari,Historyvol. 1), but many Islamic scholars contest the authenticity or interpretation of such traditions. The Qur’an states, “O mankind! We created you from a single (pair) … and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know each other. Verily the most honored of you in the sight of Allah is he who is the most righteous” (Qur’an 49:13).Reference:The Qur’an 49:13Lewis, B. (1990).Race and Slavery in the Middle East. Oxford University Press.Non-theismHistorical non-theists, such as certain proponents of Social Darwinism, have at times propagated racist ideologies (cf. Spencer,The Principles of Biology, 1864). However, contemporary non-theism (e.g., secular humanism) formally rejects racism.Reference:Spencer, H. (1864).The Principles of BiologyShermer, M. (2006).Why Darwin Matters. Holt.Scholarly Note:Sweeping generalizations risk misrepresentation. Both traditions contain diverse perspectives, and modern adherents often repudiate historical prejudices.Exhibit 4: Attitudes Toward ChristiansClaim:Both non-theists and Muslims are hostile to Christianity.IslamSome Qur’anic verses warn against intimate alliances with non-Muslims (Qur’an 5:51). Other verses uphold peaceful coexistence and tolerance (Qur’an 2:256). Historical and political contexts greatly influence interpretation.Reference:The Qur’an 5:51, 2:256Firestone, R. (1999).Jihad: The Origin of Holy War in Islam. Oxford.Non-theismAtheist regimes (e.g., Soviet Union) at times persecuted Christians, but non-theism as a philosophical stance varies widely regarding religion.Reference:Froese, P. (2008).The Plot to Kill God. University of California Press.Scholarly Note:Attributing hostility to entire worldviews requires careful qualification. Religious persecution has complex political, historical, and social causes.Exhibit 5: Authority of Dead Prophets/FoundersClaim:Both non-theists and Muslims revere the teachings of deceased leaders.IslamMuslims regard Muhammad as the final prophet, but not as divine; their ultimate authority is the Qur’an, believed to be God’s revelation (Qur’an 33:40).Reference:The Qur’an 33:40Watt, W.M. (1953).Muhammad at Medina. Oxford.Non-theismNon-theists may draw inspiration from figures such as Charles Darwin, but do not attribute prophetic status or authority akin to religious veneration.Reference:Ruse, M. (2006).Darwinism and Its Discontents. Cambridge.Scholarly Note:The analogy between prophetic authority and scientific influence is tenuous; religious authority is rooted in revelation, while scientific legacy is subject to revision.ConclusionWhile the article identifies select parallels between non-theism and Islam, rigorous academic and theological analysis demonstrates substantial differences in foundational beliefs, historical contexts, and internal diversity. Scholarship urges caution against broad generalizations, emphasizing critical inquiry and contextual understanding.ReferencesThe Qur’an (various translations).Dawkins, R. (2006).The God Delusion.

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba | Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionIn recent decades, questions surrounding Islam’s attitude toward Black Africans have become increasingly relevant, particularly as some Islamic proponents seek to recruit African Americans by claiming that Islam is a “Black religion,” that its origins are African, or even that Muhammad himself was Black. This narrative is carefully constructed to appeal to Black audiences, while a different approach is used for non-Black groups. As such, it is crucial to scrutinize these claims, not through the lens of race or origin, but on the merits and actual teachings of Islam itself. This article draws primarily from Islamic sacred texts—the Qur’an and Hadith (specifically,Sahih al-BukhariandSahih Muslim)—to objectively evaluate Islam’s historical and scriptural relationship with Black Africans.1. Africa Was Not the Cradle of IslamIslam originated in the7th century CEon the Arabian Peninsula, a region geographically situated in Asia, separated from Africa by the Red Sea. The claim that Islam is inherently African is historically inaccurate. The spread of Islam into Africa occurred after its birth in Arabia, and while Islam has a significant presence in Africa today, it did not originate there.By contrast, Christianity’s presence in Africa dates back to thefirst century. Saint Mark, the author of the Gospel of Mark, was a North African Jew who preached Christianity in Egypt. From there, Christianity spread throughout North and sub-Saharan Africa. The early church recognized Black saints, such asSaint Moses the BlackandSaint Tekla Haimanot(Ethiopia). Notably, one of the early church prophets and teachers was “Simeon Niger” (Acts 13:1), where “Niger” is Latin for “Black.” The first recorded African Christian was the Ethiopian official baptized by Philip (Acts 8:26–40).2. Muhammad Was Not BlackMuhammad was an Arab from the Quraysh tribe, ethnically and phenotypically distinct from Black Africans. Multiple Islamic sources describe Muhammad as having a fair or white complexion:Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 1, Hadith 63:“While we were sitting with the Prophet, a man came and asked, ‘Who among you is Muhammad?’ We replied, ‘This white man reclining on his arm…’”Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 2, Hadith 122:Refers to Muhammad as a “white man.”Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 2, Hadith 141:“The whiteness of his armpits became visible when he raised his arms.”It is therefore a historical and textual error to portray Muhammad as a Black African.3. Muhammad and the Issue of Black SlavesMuhammad owned Black slaves. Notable among them were Bilal, Abu Huraira, Usama ibn Zayd, and a young slave named Rabbah. Even today, in Saudi Arabia—the birthplace of Islam—the common word for “Black person” is“Abd”, meaning “slave.” This reflects a deeply ingrained social hierarchy based on race.Example from Hadith:On one occasion, a man freed a female slave who was his concubine. Upon hearing this, Muhammad auctioned the boy she bore, selling him for 800 dirhams (Sahih Muslim, Vol. 7, p. 83).The penalty for adultery varied based on status:A free man received 100 lashes and exile; a free woman was stoned to death; a slave woman received 100 lashes, but neither exile nor execution, because she was property and could be resold if she repeated the offense (Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 8:821, 822).4. Islam’s Disparaging Attitude Toward BlacksIslamic scriptures contain language and references that are derogatory toward Black people.Muhammad referred to Black people as “raisins-heads” (Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 1, No. 662; Vol. 9, No. 256).In another authentic hadith, Muhammad is quoted as saying,“Black people steal when they are hungry, and when they are full, they commit adultery”(Sahih Muslim).Muhammad reportedly said,“You must obey your leader even if he is an Ethiopian slave with a flat nose”—a reference that reinforces both racial and class prejudice (Sahih Muslim, Vol. 9, pp. 46–47).5. Islam and the Question of Freedom and EqualityEven if one were to erroneously claim that Islam began in Africa or that Muhammad was Black, these would not justify embracing Islam, particularly given its stance on human rights and freedom.Islamic law and scripture do not champion religious freedom.The Qur’an states:“If anyone desires a religion other than Islam, never will it be accepted of him; and in the Hereafter he will be among the losers.”(Qur’an 3:85)Islamic teachings include:Men are superior to women:Qur’an 2:228Women’s rights are half those of men:In testimony: Qur’an 2:282In inheritance: Qur’an 4:11A man may beat his wife:Qur’an 4:34A man may marry up to four wives:Qur’an 4:3Muslims must fight until all opponents submit:Qur’an 9:5A Muslim may not befriend Jews or Christians:Qur’an 5:54Apostates must be killed:Qur’an 9:12Theft punished by hand amputation:Qur’an 5:41Adultery punished by flogging in public:Qur’an 24:2No separation between religion and state:Qur’an 2:193No dissent tolerated:Qur’an 4:59These positions are in direct conflict with the ideals of civil and human rights.6. Islam’s Contemporary Treatment of Black AfricansClaims that Islam cares about Black people are contradicted by ongoing abuses. For instance, Black Muslim communities in Sudan have been enslaved, persecuted, and massacred by Arab Muslims. Reports by the U.S. State Department have documented cases where Black Christians were captured and sold as slaves (U.S. State Dept., May 26, 1993).7. The Christian AlternativeIn contrast, Jesus Christ offers eternal life and true equality:“There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.”(Galatians 3:28)“You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”(John 8:32)“Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery.”(Galatians 5:1–2)Christian teaching makes no racial, gender, or social distinctions before God.ConclusionThe claims that Islam is a religion for Black people, or that it is African in origin, are both unfounded and manipulative. True religious commitment must be based on the content of faith, not race or geography.Know the truth. Follow the truth.

    "full_content": "INTRODUCTIONFor more than twenty years now, it has become common to hear in lectures conducted by Islamic scholars, which have spread in various parts of the world, especially in East and Central African countries. These scholars teach communities through the Quran and the Bible by saying that there is only one God. They say that God in Hebrew is called Jehovah, in Arabic Allah, in English God, and in Swahili Mungu. Therefore, they claim that the God Allah as taught in the Quran is the same as Jehovah as taught in the Bible. These lectures conducted by Muslims have become widespread, for example, in Tanzania there are many groups, one of which is called Al-Marid International Propagation Center. They have written on their banner quoting from the Bible, words written by the Apostle Paul in Ephesians 4:4-6. The words they quoted say, \"There is one Lord, one faith... one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.\" When I visited Morogoro town, at the airport area, I saw a mosque with these words from Ephesians 4:4-6 written on it. When I visited Nairobi in Kenya, I also saw many groups conducting lectures, and one of them is called Kibera Islamic Propagation Centre. They have written a message on their banner saying, \"Let the Bible speak for itself,\" quoting this verse from the Gospel of John 8:32, \"And you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.\"Thus, you will see that these Islamic scholars teach the community using the Quran and the Bible, saying that Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala is Jehovah. They spread this teaching through Radio, Pamphlets, Lectures, books, and Video and Audio tapes. This has caused some Christians to leave their faith and convert to Islam. Some other Christians, although they have not changed their religion, believe this. The important question for every Christian to ask is, is it true that the God Allah as narrated in the Quran is the same as Jehovah as taught in the Bible? I urge you to follow this lesson carefully to know the truth...MAIN PARTS OF THIS LESSON ARE AS FOLLOWS...The arguments of Muslims saying Allah is Jehovah.Is the name of God according to the Quran and the Bible the same?Is the chief angel of Allah the same as Jehovah's?Who is the creator, Allah or Jehovah?The city chosen by Allah, is it the same as Jehovah's?How does Allah teach about purifying the soul, is it the same as Jehovah?Is Jehovah's heaven the same as Allah's?What is the end of those who worship Allah?1. The Arguments of Muslims Saying Allah is JehovahIslamic scholars say that the God Allah is Jehovah because the prophets of God according to the Bible and the Quran taught by saying that there is only one God. And they read these verses...What Prophet Moses said:Deuteronomy 6:4\"Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one.\"What Prophet Isaiah said:Isaiah 45:18,21\"For thus says the LORD, who created the heavens (He is God!), who formed the earth and made it... I am the LORD, and there is no other. A righteous God and a Savior; there is none besides Me.\"What Prophet David said:Psalms 86:10\"For You are great and do wondrous things; You alone are God.\"What Jesus said:John 17:3\"And this is eternal life, that they know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent.\"What Paul said:1 Corinthians 8:4\"Therefore, as to the eating of food offered to idols, we know that an idol has no real existence, and that there is no God but one.\"Here, Islamic scholars say that all prophets according to the Bible teach that there is only one God. What did Muhammad (s.a.w.) teach about God? They read these verses from the Quran...Quran 41:6 Surah Ha-Mim Sajdah (The Prostration)\"Say, 'I am only a man like you, to whom has been revealed that your God is one God...’\"Here, the scholars say that just as all prophets taught about one God, so did Muhammad.Quran 29:46-47 Surah Al-Ankabut (The Spider)\"And do not argue with the People of the Scripture except in a way that is best, except for those who commit injustice among them, and say, 'We believe in that which has been revealed to us and revealed to you. And our God and your God is one; and we are Muslims [in submission] to Him.' And thus We have sent down to you the Book. And those to whom We [previously] gave the Scripture believe in it. And among these [people of Makkah] are those who believe in it. And none reject Our verses except the disbelievers.\"Here, Islamic scholars say that the books of the Torah and the Gospel do not contradict the Quran, and these books were given to the Jews and Christians, and the God of Muslims and Christians is one.Is this argument true? I will answer this later.Responses about One GodIf you quickly look at how these Islamic scholars compare the verses of the Quran and the Bible, you might be convinced to believe what they teach, but it is good to study in depth according to the Quran and the Bible and then see if there is any truth in their teachings that Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala is Jehovah. Remember, the God we worship warned us Christians by saying...Exodus 20:1-3\"And God spoke all these words, saying, 'I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. You shall have no other gods before Me.'\"This warning from our God about having no other gods implies that there are other gods worshipped by people. Because in the Bible the word \"God\" in Hebrew \"Elohim\" and in Greek \"Theos\" is mentioned 3979 times, but false gods are mentioned 271 times. Some of these false gods are:Dagon (Judges 16:23)Baal (1 Kings 18:21)Artemis of the Ephesians (Acts 19:24-28)Additionally, when we read the Quran, it also mentions various gods that were worshipped in Mecca, such as:Quran 53:19-20,23 Surah An-Najm (The Star)\"19. So have you considered al-Lat and al-'Uzza? 20. And Manat, the third - the other one? 23. They are not but [mere] names you have named them - you and your forefathers - for which Allah has sent down no authority. They follow not except assumption and what their souls desire, and there has already come to them from their Lord guidance.\"Therefore, we see that there are many gods that are worshipped, and everyone who worships relies on that god and says there is one. For example, those who worshipped Dagon said he was one god, those who worshipped Baal said he was one god, those who worshipped Artemis said she was the great goddess. Likewise, the prophets served one God named Jehovah, and Muhammad worshipped one god named Allah. What I want to teach the community to know is whether Allah is Jehovah.2. Is the Name of God According to the Quran and the Bible the Same?One fundamental thing that identifies anything or anyone, be it a person, animal, or anything, is a name. Therefore, to know if the God worshipped by Muslims is the same as the one we Christians worship, we must look at the name. Is it the same?Quran 17:110 Surah Bani Israil (The Children of Israel)\"Say, 'Call upon Allah or call upon the Most Merciful. Whichever [name] you call - to Him belong the best names.'...\"Here we see that Allah teaches Muslims to call upon Him by the name Allah or the Most Merciful. Reading the Quran, we see the name Allah mentioned 2866 times. Remember, the Quran has 30 Juzus and 114 Surahs. So the God worshipped by Muslims according to the Quran is named Allah.The name of the God worshipped by Christians is this:Exodus 6:2-3\"God spoke to Moses and said to him, 'I am Jehovah. I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as God Almighty, but by my name Jehovah I did not make myself known to them.'\"Here we see that the God we Christians worship identifies His name as Jehovah. In the Bible, the word or name \"LORD\" in English translates to Jehovah, indicating a very holy name of God. This name is mentioned 6751 times in the Bible. Remember, the Bible has a total of 66 books, 1189 chapters, and 31,102 verses.3. Is the Chief Angel of Allah the Same as Jehovah's?If Allah is Jehovah, then it is clear that the chief angel would also be the same. If not the same, then the chief angels are different. Let's first look at how Allah narrates in the Quran, and he says...**Quran 81:19-21 Surah At-Takwir (The Overthrowing/The Folding Up)**\"Indeed, the Quran is a word conveyed by a noble messenger (Gabriel), Who is possessed of power and with the Owner of the Throne, secure [in position], Obeyed there [in the heavens] and trustworthy.\"The explanation of these verses inside the Quran teaches that the noble messenger and the one obeyed in the heavens is Gabriel, who is the chief of all angels.The chief angel of the God Jehovah is this:Jude 1:9\"But Michael the archangel, when he disputed with the devil and argued about the body of Moses, did not dare pronounce against him a railing judgment, but said, 'The Lord rebuke you!'\"Here we see the verses clearly teaching that the chief angel of the God named Allah is called Gabriel, while the chief angel of our God Jehovah is called Michael. The question is: Since these angels are different, is Allah the same as Jehovah? To know more about the differences between the angels, get a copy of the lesson: \"Is Gabriel the Same as Jibril?\" We have that lesson; get a copy.4. Who is the Creator, Allah or Jehovah?Everyone who follows religion believes that God is the creator who created humans, animals, and all we see and do not see. So it is appropriate to look at what is said by Jehovah about creation and what Allah says. Do their statements agree or differ?Who Was Man Created in the Image of?Allah says this:Quran 112:1-4 Surah Al-Ikhlas (The Purity/The Sincerity)\"Say, 'He is Allah, [who is] One, Allah, the Eternal Refuge. He neither begets nor is born, Nor is there to Him any equivalent.'\"According to this verse, Allah says that God neither begets nor is born and that there is no one comparable to Him. Jehovah says this about man...Genesis 1:26-27\"Then God said, 'Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over the cattle and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.' God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.\"Here we see that our God Jehovah created man in His own image, but Allah says there is no one comparable to Him. The question for you, the follower: Is Allah Jehovah? Please read these verses to know more (Genesis 5:1-2, 9:6, 1 Corinthians 11:7, Colossians 1:15, 3:10, Acts 17:28-29, James 3:9). You might ask, \"In what way does God resemble me?\" Know that God is Spirit (John 4:24) and He gave us the breath (spirit of life) (Genesis 2:7). Moreover, God is the Father of our spirits (Hebrews 12:9), and He says our spirits belong to Him (Ezekiel 18:4, Numbers 16:22).Swearing by God about CreationQuran 91:1-7 Surah Ash-Shams (The Sun)\"By the sun and its brightness, And by the moon when it follows it, And by the day when it displays it, And by the night when it covers it, And by the sky and He who constructed it, And by the earth and He who spread it, And by the soul and He who proportioned it.\"Quran 92:1-3 Surah Al-Lail (The Night)\"By the night when it covers, And by the day when it appears, And by [the One] who created the male and the female.\"Here we see that Allah swears by the sky and He who constructed it, by the earth and He who spread it. Who is this spreader of the earth and the builder of the sky? The Quran continues to narrate...Quran 45:22 Surah Al-Jathiyah (The Kneeling)\"And Allah created the heavens and the earth in truth...\"Quran 44:7-8 Surah Ad-Dukhan (The Smoke)\"[He is] the Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them, if you should be certain. There is no deity except Him; He gives life and causes death. [He is] your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers.\"Here we see that Allah, through the Quran, says that Allah created the heavens and the earth, and again he says there is no deity except Him. The builder of the sky and the spreader of the earth says this...Isaiah 44:24\"Thus says the LORD, your Redeemer, and the one who formed you from the womb, 'I, the LORD, am the maker of all things, stretching out the heavens by Myself and spreading out the earth all alone.'\"Our God Jehovah says, \"I make all things.\" (Read Isaiah 45:6-7, 11-12, Jeremiah 27:5). Surely Jehovah is the creator of all things.Did God Jehovah Swear by the Things He Created like Allah?Isaiah 45:22-23\"Turn to Me and be saved, all the ends of the earth; For I am God, and there is no other. I have sworn by Myself; The word has gone forth from My mouth in righteousness And will not turn back, That to Me every knee will bow, every tongue will swear allegiance.\"Hebrews 6:13-16\"For when God made the promise to Abraham, since He could swear by no one greater, He swore by Himself, saying, 'I will surely bless you and I will surely multiply you.' And so, having patiently waited, he obtained the promise. For men swear by one greater than themselves, and with them an oath given as confirmation is an end of every dispute.\"Here we see that our God Jehovah does not swear by any person or the things He created, like Allah swears, but Jehovah says, \"I swear by Myself.\" You can also read how Jehovah swore by Himself in these verses: (Isaiah 14:24 and Genesis 22:16).5. The City Chosen by Allah, Is It the Same as Jehovah's?The City of Allah:Quran 27:91 Surah An-Naml (The Ants)\"I have only been commanded to worship the Lord of this city (Makkah), who made it sacred and to whom belongs all things...\"Quran 3:96 Surah Aal-Imran (The Family of Imran)\"Indeed, the first House [of worship] established for mankind was that at Makkah - blessed and a guidance for the worlds.\"Quran 106:3-4 Surah Quraysh (The Quraysh)\"So let them worship the Lord of this House (the Kaaba), Who has fed them, [saving them] from hunger and made them safe, [saving them] from fear.\"Thus, we see that Allah is the Lord of the Kaaba according to these verses, and the Kaaba is in Makkah. Through these verses, we see that Allah, the god worshipped by Muslims, has chosen the city of Makkah as his holy city, and Muhammad (s.a.w) was commanded to worship the Lord of this city of Makkah, who is Allah.What city did our God Jehovah choose? Continue reading...The City Chosen by Our God Jehovah Is This...2 Chronicles 6:4-6\"He said, 'Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who spoke with His mouth to my father David and has fulfilled it with His hands, saying, ‘Since the day that I brought My people out of the land of Egypt, I did not choose a city out of all the tribes of Israel in which to build a house that My name might be there, nor did I choose any man for a leader over My people Israel; but I have chosen Jerusalem that My name might be there, and I have chosen David to be over My people Israel.’\"The Scriptures do not mention any other city chosen by our God here on earth except the city of Jerusalem. (See 2 Chronicles 12:13, Ezra 6:12; 7:15,27; Psalms 26:8; Zechariah 2:12)Through these verses, we see that our God Jehovah, His chosen city is Jerusalem. The name Jerusalem is in Hebrew and means \"foundation of peace.\" Even when the Israelites were far from the city of Jerusalem, they knelt and faced Jerusalem. (See Daniel 6:10). The city chosen by Jehovah is Jerusalem, and the city chosen by Allah is Makkah. And this is the difference between the city of Allah and Jehovah.6. How Does Allah Teach about Purifying the Soul, Is It the Same as Jehovah?Allah teaches this...Quran 53:32 Surah An-Najm (The Star)\"Those who avoid the major sins and immoralities, only [committing] slight ones - indeed, your Lord is vast in forgiveness. He was most knowing of you when He produced you from the earth and when you were fetuses in the wombs of your mothers. So do not claim yourselves to be pure...\"Quran 12:53 Surah Yusuf (Joseph)\"And I do not acquit myself. Indeed, the soul is a persistent enjoiner of evil,except those upon which my Lord has mercy. Indeed, my Lord is Forgiving and Merciful.\"According to the Quran, Allah instructs people not to purify themselves and again says, \"I do not purify myself.\" This is very surprising!Our God Jehovah says this about purifying the soul, i.e., holiness:Isaiah 43:3\"For I am the LORD your God, The Holy One of Israel, your Savior; I have given Egypt as your ransom, Cush and Seba in your place.\"Here we see that God says, \"I am the Holy One.\" This is also a descriptive name for our God Jehovah. In Hebrew, it is called \"Kadosh.\" The Prophet Isaiah has written that God is Holy 32 times. For a quick reference, read Isaiah 40:25, 48:17, and 57:15. Moreover, because our God Jehovah is holy, He instructed us thus...Leviticus 11:44\"For I am the LORD your God. Consecrate yourselves therefore, and be holy, for I am holy. And you shall not make yourselves unclean with any of the swarming things that swarm on the earth.\"The Apostle Peter instructs us thus:1 Peter 1:15-16\"But like the Holy One who called you, be holy yourselves also in all your behavior; because it is written, 'You shall be holy, for I am holy.'\"The Apostle Paul also instructed to purify the soul and be holy (2 Corinthians 7:1).You can also read this instruction to be holy in Leviticus 19:2, 20:26.Therefore, we see that Jehovah commands us to purify our souls to be holy, but Allah commands Muslims not to purify their souls.Question for you, the follower: Is Allah Jehovah?7. Is Jehovah's Heaven the Same as Allah's Paradise (Heaven)?Jehovah's Heaven:Luke 20:34-36\"Jesus said to them, 'The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage, but those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage; for they cannot even die anymore, because they are like angels, and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.'\"These Scriptures assure Christians that when we are resurrected and enter heaven, there will be no marriage because we will have spiritual bodies (1 Corinthians 15:43-54). Additionally, the Scriptures teach us that the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit (Romans 14:17). Our God teaches clearly that in heaven in His kingdom, there is no hunger or thirst or sun to beat down on us (Revelation 7:16-17).Allah's Paradise or Heaven will be like this:i. MansionsQuran 39:20 Surah Az-Zumar (The Groups)\"But those who have feared their Lord will have chambers, above them chambers built high, beneath which rivers flow. [This is] the promise of Allah. Allah does not fail in [His] promise.\"ii. Rivers of water, milk, wine, honey, and fruitsQuran 47:15 Surah Muhammad\"The description of Paradise, which the righteous are promised, is that in it are rivers of water unaltered, rivers of milk the taste of which never changes, rivers of wine delicious to those who drink, and rivers of purified honey, in which they will have from all kinds of fruits and forgiveness from their Lord. [Are they] like those who abide eternally in the Fire and are given to drink scalding water that will sever their intestines?\"iii. They will have women of certain kinds and bird meatQuran 56:15-23 Surah Al-Waqi'ah (The Inevitable) - I quote verses 21-23 only\"And meat of fowl, from whatever they desire. And [for them are] fair women with large, [beautiful] eyes, The likenesses of pearls well-protected.\"Quran 37:48-49 Surah As-Saffat (Those who set the Ranks)\"And with them will be women limiting [their] glances, with large, [beautiful] eyes, As if they were [delicate] eggs, well-protected.\"Quran 37:44-46 Surah As-Saffat (Those who set the Ranks)\"They will be on thrones facing each other. Circulated among them will be a cup [of wine] from a flowing spring, White and delicious to the drinkers.\"Through these verses, we have seen that Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala, the god worshipped by Muslims, has promised to admit Muslims into paradise (heaven) where they will have rivers of water, rivers of milk, wine, and honey. They will also have fruits, bird meat, and will be married off to women with large eyes like ostrich eggs and others with large eyes like cups.The surprising thing is when we read the book of Hadith, because the faith of Islam is also built on the books of Hadith. Read...Quran 42:10 Surah Ash-Shura (The Consultation)\"And in anything over which you disagree - its ruling is [to be referred] to Allah. [Say], 'That is Allah, my Lord; upon Him I have relied, and to Him I turn back.'\"When we read the book of Hadith of the Prophet called Sunan Ibn Majah vol 5 page 546 Hadith No: 4337, there are these explanations:Narrated Abu Umama: The Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said Allah will not allow anyone to enter paradise but Allah the Mighty and Glorious will marry him with seventy-two wives. Two will be virgins (Huris) with big eyes, and seventy will be his inheritance from the people (husbands) who were thrown into Hellfire. Each one of them (the women) will have a pleasant vagina, and the man’s sexual organ will not bend down (during intercourse) but will last long.In English, this Hadith reads:Abu Umama (Allah be pleased with him) reported that Allah's messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said Allah will not admit anyone into Paradise but Allah the Mighty and Glorious, will marry him with seventy-two wives. Two will be from virgins (Huris) with big eyes, and seventy will be his inheritance from the people of Hellfire. Each one of them will have a pleasant vagina, and the man’s sexual organ will not bend down (during sexual intercourse) but will last long.This is what Allah, the God of Muslims, has promised. This is something that surprises a Christian greatly because what is taught by Allah is not found at all with our God Jehovah. Here on earth is where there is wine, fruits, bird meat, marrying, mansions, cars, rivers, seas, and other things.Consider, who is this Allah?8. What Is the End of Those Who Worship Allah?We know that Christians will live with our God Jehovah forever (see 1 Thessalonians 4:13-17 and Revelation 21:3-7). Thus, our God is eternal. But when we read the Quran and the Hadith of Muhammad, the Prophet of the Muslims, we see these teachings...Quran 51:56 Surah Adh-Dhariyat (The Winnowing Winds)\"And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me.\"Quran 6:128 Surah Al-An'am (The Cattle)\"And [mention, O Muhammad], the Day when He will gather them all and say, 'O company of jinn, you have misled many of mankind.' And their allies among mankind will say, 'Our Lord, we benefited from each other, and we have reached our term which You appointed for us.' He will say, 'The Fire is your residence, wherein you will abide eternally, except for what Allah wills. Indeed, your Lord is Wise and Knowing.'\"In these verses, we see that the jinn along with all people will be thrown into the fire. How about Allah? When we read the book of Hadith of the Prophet (s.a.w) called Sahih al-Bukhari Vol: VI Hadith No: 371. Page 353, there are these words:Quran 50:30 Surah Qaf (The Letter Qaf)\"On the Day We will say to Hell, 'Have you been filled?' and it will say, 'Are there any more?'\"Narrated Anas: The Prophet said, \"People will be thrown into the (Hell) Fire and it will say, 'Are there any more (to come)?' until Allah puts His Foot over it and it will say, 'Qat! Qat!' (Enough! Enough!)\"In English, this Hadith reads:Allah's statement: It (Hell) will say, \"Are there any more (to come)?\" (50:30). Narrated Anas: The Prophet said, \"People will be thrown into the (Hell) Fire and it will say, 'Are there any more (to come)?' (50:30) till Allah puts His Foot over it and it will say, 'Qat! Qat!' (Enough! Enough!)\"In this verse, we see that Allah, the god of Muslims, asks Hell if it is full, and Hell will ask Allah, \"Are there any more?\" This question implies thatHell was not yet full.The explanation of this Hadith confirms that Allah will place His foot in Hell, and then Hell will say, \"Enough! Enough!\" meaning it is full with the act of Allah putting His foot there. This is completely different from our God Jehovah, who has prepared Hell specifically for the wicked, the devil, and his angels. Please read these verses: Matthew 25:41, 46, Revelation 20:10, 21:8.All these verses show that the end of the wicked, the devil, and his angels is in the lake of fire. Question for you, dear friend, who is Allah?I hope that through the Quran, the Bible, and the Hadith of the Prophet Muhammad, you have been able to learn in depth that Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala, the god worshipped by Muslims, is not Jehovah, the God we Christians worship.ShalomDr. Max Shimba for Max Shimba Ministries Org",

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba | Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis article offers a critical and comparative theological examination of the divinity of Jesus Christ in both Christianity and Islam. While the Bible explicitly affirms Jesus as divine, eternal, and sovereign, the Quran presents a differing view, denying the deity of Christ and affirming strict monotheism through the person of Allah. This study seeks to explore, from a scholarly perspective, what each of these two Abrahamic faiths teaches concerning the identity of Jesus and the nature of God, using authoritative texts—the Bible and the Quran—as the primary sources of analysis.IntroductionThe question \"Is Jesus God?\" remains one of the most defining and debated theological inquiries in human history. The answer to this question divides the world's two largest religions—Christianity and Islam. Christianity holds that Jesus is the divine Son of God, the second Person of the Trinity, eternally existing with God the Father and the Holy Spirit. Islam, on the other hand, maintains that Jesus (Isa) is a revered prophet, but categorically denies His divinity, asserting that Allah alone is God.This article explores how each faith constructs its understanding of divinity and attributes such as eternity, omnipotence, and finality, focusing especially on the titles given to God and Jesus in their respective scriptures.The Eternity of God and Christ: A Comparative ViewIn the Quran, Allah is referred to by 99 beautiful names (Asma al-Husna) that describe His nature and attributes. Two of these names are especially relevant to our discussion:Al-Awwal(ٱلْأَوَّلُ) –The First, found inSurah Al-Hadid (57:3):\"He is the First and the Last, the Ascendant and the Intimate, and He is, of all things, Knowing.\"This name underscores the eternal pre-existence of Allah, an attribute central to Islamic theology.Al-Akhir(ٱلْآخِرُ) –The Last, also inQuran 57:3, indicating God’s unending nature and absolute finality.In Christian theology, similar attributes are used to describe Jesus Christ. In fact, Revelation 1:8 records Jesus saying:“I am the Alpha and the Omega,”says the Lord God,“who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty.”(Revelation 1:8, NIV)Alpha and Omega are the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet, symbolizing the fullness of time and being. These titles echo the same eternal qualities attributed to God in the Old Testament (cf. Isaiah 44:6), but they are here used directly by Jesus, claiming the very nature and identity of God.Moreover, Revelation 22:13 further affirms this:“I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.”In this, Jesus not only parallels but directly claims the divine titles of Yahweh, indicating that He shares in the eternal nature of God.The Biblical Evidence for the Deity of ChristThe New Testament is rich with Christological affirmations of Jesus’ divinity. For example:John 1:1-3:“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God... Through Him all things were made.”Colossians 1:16-17:“For in Him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth... all things have been created through Him and for Him.”Hebrews 1:3:“The Son is the radiance of God’s glory and the exact representation of His being, sustaining all things by His powerful word.”These passages affirm not only Jesus' eternal preexistence but also His role in creation, a function attributed only to God in Jewish monotheism.The Quranic Rejection of Christ’s DivinityWhile the Quran honors Jesus (Isa) as a prophet and the Messiah, it strictly denies that He is divine or that He is the Son of God.Surah Al-Ikhlas (112:1-4):\"Say: He is Allah, [who is] One, Allah, the Eternal Refuge. He neither begets nor is born, nor is there to Him any equivalent.\"Surah An-Nisa (4:171):“...Say not ‘Three’; desist—it is better for you. Indeed, Allah is but one God. Exalted is He above having a son.”Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:72):“They have certainly disbelieved who say, ‘Allah is the Messiah, the son of Mary’...”From the Quranic perspective, associating Jesus with God (known asshirk) is a grave theological error. Islam's monotheism (tawhid) is uncompromising, and any claim of divine sonship is considered blasphemous.Theological ImplicationsThe tension between ChristianTrinitarianismand IslamicTawhidis unbridgeable on doctrinal grounds. Christianity's assertion that Jesus is both fully God and fully man—God incarnate—lies at the heart of the Gospel. The Quran's denial of this identity creates an irreconcilable divergence.Yet, both scriptures ascribe eternal titles—The Beginning and The End—to the divine. The critical distinction is that the Bible attributes these titles directly to Jesus Christ, implying His full participation in the divine nature. In contrast, the Quran reserves these names for Allah alone and considers any sharing of these attributes a violation of monotheism.ConclusionThis comparative theological study demonstrates that the Bible and the Quran offer fundamentally different views on the identity and nature of Jesus. In Christianity, Jesus is not merely a prophet but God incarnate—eternal, omnipotent, and worthy of worship. In Islam, Jesus is a revered messenger but strictly human, subordinate to Allah, and never divine.Thus, the question,Is Jesus God?is not merely a matter of interpretation but of doctrinal allegiance. For the Christian, Jesus is \"the image of the invisible God\" (Colossians 1:15), the eternal Logos who \"became flesh\" (John 1:14). For the Muslim, such a belief is incompatible with the core tenets of Islamic monotheism.About the AuthorDr. Maxwell Shimba is a theologian, apologist, and founder of the Shimba Theological Institute.

    "full_content": "Title: IF JESUS’ SUBMISSION TO HIS FATHER MAKES HIM A MUSLIM, THEN WHO IS ALLAH’S SON?Author: Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionIslamic apologists frequently argue that Jesus was a Muslim because He submitted to the will of God. They anchor this on the Arabic definition of \"Islam\" (submission) and \"Muslim\" (one who submits to God). However, this argument is not only linguistically shallow, but theologically incoherent when analyzed through the lenses of both Christian doctrine and Islamic theology. If submission alone defines a person as Muslim, then Abraham, Moses, David, and even Satan—who at times obeyed God's command—could qualify. Yet, the core of Islamic theology rejects the very foundation upon which Jesus operated: the intimate relationship with God asHis Father.Hence, we pose a question that penetrates the heart of Islamic theology and exposes its inherent contradictions:“Is Allah a Father in any sense?”I. Submission in Context: Jesus and the FatherChristianity does not define Jesus merely by His submission to God, but by His uniqueSonshipanddivine identity. Jesus' submission (e.g., Luke 22:42 –\"Not my will, but yours be done\") is a relational act within the Trinity—between theSon and the Father—not a servile obedience between a slave and master.“I and the Father are one.” (John 10:30)This declaration, to Christians, affirms not just submission butunity in essence, co-equality, and mutual love. Islam, on the other hand,categorically deniesthis relationship. According to the Quran:“Say: He is Allah, the One and Only; Allah, the Eternal, Absolute; He begets not, nor is He begotten.” (Surah Al-Ikhlas 112:1–3)This verse refutes any notion of divine Fatherhood or Sonship, making the Islamic God (Allah) completelynon-relational.So the question arises: If Jesus' submission makes Him a Muslim, then towhomdid He submit? Clearly, not to theAllahof the Quran, who denies having any son. Jesus called God“Abba” (Father)(Mark 14:36), a term utterly alien and evenblasphemousin Islamic theology.II. Is Allah a Father in Any Sense?In Christianity, God is revealed as aFather:To Jesus uniquely (Matthew 3:17),To believers spiritually (John 1:12),And as Creator of all (Malachi 2:10).Islam, however, denounces all three:Not the Father of Jesus– Surah 4:171:“Do not say ‘Three.’ Cease! It is better for you. Allah is only one God. Far be it from His glory to have a son.”Not a spiritual father– Allah hasslaves(abd), notsons(ibn).Not a relational father even in metaphor– Surah 5:18 rebukes Jews and Christians:“The Jews and the Christians say, ‘We are the sons of Allah and His beloved.’ Say: Why then does He punish you for your sins?”In effect,Allah is not a father in any relational, redemptive, or theological sense. This makes submission to Allah fundamentally different from submission to the Father of Jesus Christ. Jesus’ submission was an act ofdivine love, not merely obligation.III. Jesus the Son vs. Muhammad the ServantChristians believe that Jesus is:Theeternal Wordmade flesh (John 1:14),Theonly begotten Son(John 3:16),Theradiance of God’s glory(Hebrews 1:3).Muslims claim Muhammad is theservant and messengerof Allah (*‘abd’ and *‘rasul’), but reject any divine Sonship. Thus, Jesus stands inrelational intimacywith the Father, while Muhammad stands as adistant slaveto a master.To equate Jesus' submission to Muslim submission is acategory mistake. It ignores Christ's divine origin, eternal Sonship, and pre-incarnate glory:“Before Abraham was, I am.” (John 8:58)If Jesus' obedience to the Father makes Him a Muslim, thenAbraham’s obedienceto sacrifice his son should make him Christian—since the Bible says it wasIsaac, not Ishmael (Genesis 22:2). Why the double standard?IV. The Fatal Flaw in Muslim ApologeticsMuslim apologists rely on semantics—“Islam” meaning submission—to retroactively claim biblical figures. But that’s historical revisionism. Submission to God in general doesn’t define a person as Muslim in the Quranic sense unless it’s toAllah as defined by Muhammad. Yet none of the prophets ever mentioned in the Bibleknew Allah, or affirmed theShahada(declaration that Muhammad is Allah’s prophet).Therefore, to say Jesus is a Muslim is to say:Jesus believed Muhammad was a prophet (He didn’t).Jesus denied being the Son of God (He didn’t).Jesus never called God “Father” (He did constantly).These are lies the Quran tells against the historical Jesus.V. Crushing the Myth: Jesus Cannot Be a MuslimLinguistic Submission ≠ Islamic Muslim: Submission is universal; Islam is specific to Muhammad’s theology.Allah ≠ the Father: If Jesus’ Father is not Allah, then Jesus wasn’t submitting to Allah.No Sonship in Islam: Without the Son, there is no Father. And without the Father, there is no true understanding of Jesus’ identity.Jesus was crucified(historical fact) – Islam denies this (Surah 4:157), proving it preachesanother Jesus(2 Corinthians 11:4).Conclusion: Submission Alone Doesn’t Define IslamThe attempt to redefine Jesus as a Muslim on the grounds of submission is a theological deception. It erases the intimate divine relationship between the Son and the Father and tries to replace it with a master-slave dynamic foreign to Jesus’ mission and message.So to every Muslim claiming Jesus was a Muslim because He submitted:Was Allah His Father? If not, then Jesus was not a Muslim—He is the Son of the Living God.“And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son to be the Savior of the world.” (1 John 4:14)End of Debate.Dr. Maxwell ShimbaRestorative Justice Practitioner, Bible Scholar, Founder of USA Theological UniversityPresident, Shimba Theological Institute",

Yet such a claim collapses under the weight of historical truth and biblical theology. Let us examine carefully:Jesus is not a “Muslim” nor simply a “prophet” — Jesus is the CHRIST — the very foundation of Christianity, its beginning, and its living center.1️⃣ Jesus is theChrist— Not Merely a ProphetThe Greek wordChristos(Χριστός) meansAnointed One,equivalent to the HebrewMessiah(משיח). In the Bible, Jesus is explicitly declared as the Christ:“Simon Peter answered and said,Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.”—Matthew 16:16 (KJV)The Qur’an never acknowledges Jesus asthe Christin the biblical sense — though it uses the titleal-Masihwithout understanding its deep theological meaning. Islam strips the term of its Jewish and Christian messianic significance. Yet according to the Bible, the role of the Christ is utterly unique — He is:✅ the fulfillment of prophecy (Isaiah 53, Daniel 9:24-27)✅ the divine Son (Psalm 2:7, John 1:1-14)✅ the Redeemer of mankind through the Cross (1 Corinthians 15:3-4)2️⃣ Jesus is theBeginning of ChristianityWithout Jesus, there is no Christianity — for Christianity is not a system of law, not an ethnic culture, not merely moral teachings — it is the Gospel of the person and work ofJesus Christ.“For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.”—1 Corinthians 3:11 (KJV)Christianity begins with Christ’s Incarnation, reaches its climax at the Cross and Resurrection, and proclaims His Kingdom until His return. No Jesus, no Cross, no Resurrection — no Christianity.Islam, on the other hand, speaks of Isa as a forerunner to Muhammad — but this reverses the divine order. It is Jesus who is the apex of divine revelation:“God… hath in these last days spoken unto us by His Son…”—Hebrews 1:1-2 (KJV)3️⃣ Jesus is Not aChristianin the Sense of Being a Follower of HimselfAnother common Muslim confusion is to ask: “Was Jesus a Christian?”This is a category error. AChristianis afollower of Christ.Jesus is not a follower of Himself — Heisthe Christ. He is the one we follow!“I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by Me.”—John 14:6 (KJV)He is the Head of the Body (Colossians 1:18), the firstborn from the dead (Revelation 1:5), and the Alpha and Omega (Revelation 22:13).Christiansare named after Him because we belong to Him:“And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.”—Acts 11:26 (KJV)Thus, to suggest that Jesus is “Muslim” or a mere prophet in line with Muhammad utterly misses the reality: Jesus existed long before Muhammad, long before Islam, and is the fulfillment ofGod’s eternal redemptive plan(Ephesians 1:4-10).4️⃣ Conclusion to Muslim ReadersDear Muslim friends: recognize the unique identity of Jesus the Christ. Without Jesus, there is no Christianity. He is not “one of the prophets” awaiting Muhammad — He is the Lord, the Savior, the beginning and foundation of the faith that brings eternal life (John 3:16).No Muhammad, no Islam — but without Jesus, there is no Christianity, no salvation, no Kingdom of God on earth.It is time to stop reducing Jesus to a mere prophet. Receive Him for who He truly is:JESUS IS THE CHRIST — THE SON OF THE LIVING GOD — THE BEGINNING AND LORD OF CHRISTIANITY.—By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

Do you believe this?\"Here, Jesus makes a direct and clear claim—not metaphorical, not future tense—He is the Resurrection Himself.The Quran’s Claim: Allah asAl-Ba’ithIn Islam, one ofAllah’s 99 namesisAl-Ba’ith, meaning“The Resurrector” or “The Resurrection.”Since Allah’s names are inseparable from His essence,Allah = Al-Ba’ith.Quran, Surah Al-Hajj 22:5, 7O mankind! If you are in doubt concerning the Resurrection, then verily We have created you from dust...And verily, the Hour will come, there is no doubt about it, and Allah will resurrect those who are in the graves.However, there’s a theological problem here:👉The people of Muhammad’s time doubted Allah’s ability to resurrect, precisely because they had never seen Him raise anyone from the dead!👉There was no evidence, no recorded miracle.How, then, can Allah rightfully claim the titleAl-Ba’ithwithout ever performing a resurrection?The Evidence of Jesus: A Public ResurrectionBy contrast,Jesus provided public, irrefutable evidencethat He isAl-Ba’ithby raisingLazarusfrom the dead—witnessedby many:John 11:23-25Jesus said to her, \"Your brother will rise again.\"Martha said, \"I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.\"Jesus said to her, \"I am the resurrection and the life.\"And inJohn 11:43-44, the miracle unfolds:When He had said these things, He cried out with a loud voice, \"Lazarus, come out!\" The man who had died came out, his hands and feet bound with linen strips, and his face wrapped with a cloth. Jesus said to them, \"Unbind him, and let him go.\"This event occurred632 years before Muhammadandbefore the Quran was revealed.👉 Jesus did not merely claim the title—He proved itthrough miraculous action.What Does the Quran Show?In my careful study of the Quran, I have found:👉No account of Allah raising anyone from the dead—not even Muhammad himself.👉 The titleAl-Ba’ithin the Quran remainsunsupported by evidence.👉 Allah asks people to “believe” He will resurrect the dead—but no demonstration was given, either during Muhammad’s lifetime or in the Quranic narrative.The Ultimate QuestionSo now, dear reader, consider:👉Between Jesus—who physically raised the dead—and Allah—who merely adopted the title without proof—who is the trueAl-Ba’ith?✅ Is itJesus, whose actions confirm His divine authority?❌ OrAllah, whose claim lacks demonstrated power?The VerdictFor me, and for all who seek truth, the answer is crystal clear:Jesus Christ isAl-Ba’ith—the Resurrection and the Life!He alone holds the power over life and death, proven by His works, His own resurrection, and His eternal victory over the grave.Titus 2:13\"...looking for the blessed hope and glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ.\"Shalom.Dr. Maxwell ShimbaServant of Jesus Christ, the Great God.Founder, Shimba Theological Institute",

    "full_content": "A Theological and Textual Challenge to Islamic ClaimsBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionAmong the persistent demands of Muslim apologists in interfaith dialogues is the challenge to Christians to produce averbatimstatement from Jesus in the Bible: \"I am God; worship Me.\" This demand for explicit wording is often used to undermine the doctrine of Christ’s divinity, despite the abundance of scriptural testimony to Jesus' divine nature through explicit and implicit statements, titles, and actions.Curiously, this same criterion, when turned toward the foundations of Islamic claims regarding the Torah (Tawrat), exposes a significant textual and theological gap. Muslims universally affirm that Allah revealed the Torah directly to Moses, yet upon close inspection, the Qur’an does not contain a single verse where Allahdirectlyandexplicitlysays to Moses, \"I gave you the Torah.\" Instead, the relevant verses are indirect or constructed through conjunctions and narrative summary, not through direct divine address.This article, therefore, poses a critical question to Muslim theologians and apologists:Where in the Qur’an does Allah, in His own words, say to Moses, \"I gave you the Torah\"?If such explicitness is the standard for Christian claims, let it be applied fairly and equally to the Islamic claim regarding the Torah and Moses.1. Qur’anic Passages Commonly CitedSurah 5:44“Indeed, We revealed the Torah, in which was guidance and light...”(Qur’an 5:44)This verse is clear that Allah claims to have revealed the Torah, but it is entirely silent about the recipient. There is no direct reference to Moses in this verse, nor does Allah say, \"O Moses, I have given you the Torah.\" It is a general statement about the Torah, not its transmission.Surah 32:23“And We certainly gave Moses the Scripture, so do not be in doubt over his meeting. And We made it [i.e., the Torah] guidance for the Children of Israel.”(Qur’an 32:23)Here, Allah says He gave “the Scripture” (al-kitab) to Moses. However, the Arabic does not specify “the Torah” in this clause; rather, it uses the generic word “scripture” and then, in a separate sentence, states that the Torah was made a guidance for the Children of Israel. The structure is conjunctive, not directly attributive. The Torah is not directly named as that which was given to Moses in the same breath.Surah 7:144–145“[Allah] said, ‘O Moses, I have chosen you over the people with My messages and My words to you...’ And We wrote for him on the tablets something of all things...”(Qur’an 7:144–145)Again, there is reference to “tablets” and “messages,” but the term \"Torah\" does not occur here, nor is there an explicit divine declaration: \"I have given you the Torah.\"Surah 6:154“Then We gave Moses the Scripture, making complete [Our favor] upon the one who did good and as a detailed explanation of all things...”(Qur’an 6:154)As in 32:23, the text speaks of “the Scripture” (al-kitab), but not “the Torah” (al-Tawrat). The connection between \"the Scripture\" and \"the Torah\" is made by tradition, not by the explicit words of the Qur’an itself.2. The Polemic of Explicitness: Applying the Muslim StandardMuslim polemics demand that Christians provide a direct, first-person quotation from Jesus saying, “I am God,” for the claim of His divinity to be valid. This standard is rigid and rarely applied consistently to Islamic doctrines. If we apply the same standard, we must ask:Where does Allah say, in His own words, \"O Moses, I gave you the Torah\"?Or, at the very least:Where does the Qur’an record a conversation where Allah says to Moses, \"I am giving you the Torah\"?Despite repeated references to \"scripture\" (al-kitab), \"tablets,\" and \"guidance,\" the Qur’an never contains the verbatim phrase: \"O Moses, I gave you the Torah.\" Instead, Muslim belief that Moses received the Torah is inferred through exegesis, secondary hadith sources, and traditional interpretations, rather than on the basis of explicit Qur’anic language.3. Theological and Hermeneutical ImplicationsThe absence of an explicit, direct statement from Allah to Moses regarding the Torah challenges the consistency of Muslim polemics. If Muslim doctrine rests upon inference, analogy, and interpretive tradition to assert that Moses received the Torah, then, by the same hermeneutical allowance, Christians are justified in affirming the divinity of Jesus through explicit and implicit biblical testimony, even where the exact phrase “I am God” is absent.Furthermore, the persistent demand for verbatim statements from Christian scripture is revealed to be arbitrary, selective, and ultimately self-refuting when the foundational claims of Islam itself cannot meet this bar.4. Conclusion: A Call for ConsistencyUntil and unless Muslim scholars can produce a verse from the Qur’an in which Allah, addressing Moses, says, \"I gave you the Torah,\" the Islamic claim that Moses received the Torah directly from Allah must be recognized as an inference rather than an explicit, verbatim divine statement. Consistency demands that either both traditions be allowed the interpretive space to affirm their beliefs, or both be rejected on the basis of the absence of explicit wording.Let those who demand, \"Where did Jesus say, 'I am God'?\" also be willing to answer,\"Where did Allah say to Moses, 'I gave you the Torah'?\"until then, the standard remains one of double measure.ReferencesQur’an 5:44, 32:23, 6:154, 7:144–145 (Sahih International and Yusuf Ali translations)Abdul Rahman Squires, “The Torah in the Qur’an,” Muslim ApologeticsGerald R.

While the mainstream Muslim position is clear that Jesus is regarded as a prophet and not divine, a close and literal reading of Surah At-Tawbah 9:31 introduces compelling questions. In this article, we will analyze whether the Qur’an, by its very grammar and structure, actually places Jesus alongside Allah as one who is to be worshiped.The Verse in QuestionSurah At-Tawbah 9:31 reads:“They take their rabbis and their monks as lords apart from Allah, and also the Messiah, son of Mary, whereas they were commanded to worship none but the One True God.” (9:31)A critical point is the phrase:“apart from Allah, and also the Messiah, son of Mary.”The Power of Conjunction: The Meaning of \"And\"The word“and”(Arabic:wa) is universally recognized as a conjunction that connects equal entities, persons, or objects. In this context, the conjunction grammatically unitesAllahandthe Messiah, son of Mary. The verse thus lists both Allah and the Messiah as those distinct from rabbis and monks, suggesting they share a unique status as “lords.”If the intent of the verse was merely to condemn the worship of any being except Allah, it would have sufficed to mention Allah alone. Instead, the addition of “and the Messiah, son of Mary” implies that the Messiah, too, is not to be placed in the category of created beings wrongly taken as lords, but rather is set apart with Allah as a legitimate object of worship.Reading the Verse LiterallyA plain, literal reading yields:They (Jews and Christians) take their religious leaders as lordsapart fromAllah and also the Messiah.This means: Rabbis and monks are wrongly elevated, but Allah and the Messiah are not among those false lords; they are the exception.Therefore, the text suggests that the only true Lords—those to be worshiped—areAllah and the Messiah.This interpretation is reinforced by the wording:“whereas they were commanded to worship none but the One True God.”The reference to “the One True God” immediately after mentioning both Allah and the Messiah opens the possibility that, in this context, both are subsumed under this divine identity.Implications for Christian-Muslim DialogueFor Christians, this reading resonates powerfully with the doctrine of the divinity of Jesus, the Messiah. The verse, by grammatical necessity, identifies both Allah and the Messiah as those who should be recognized as lords, in contrast to the false lordship attributed to rabbis and monks.For Muslims, such an interpretation presents a challenge to the classical doctrine oftawhid(absolute monotheism), yet it arises directly from the conjunction “and” and the logical structure of the verse. The literal sense does not support the exclusion of Jesus from divinity but, in fact, does the opposite.Counterpoints and ResponseIt is true that most Islamic commentators, both classical and modern, have interpreted this verse as a condemnation of Christians who wrongly worship Jesus, rather than as an endorsement. However, such interpretations may be influenced by pre-existing theological commitments, rather than a strict adherence to the grammatical and logical flow of the text itself. A fresh, unbiased reading demands that we allow the verse to speak for itself:Allah and the Messiah are both set apart as legitimate Lords to be worshipped.ConclusionA careful and honest reading of Surah At-Tawbah 9:31, considering the power of the conjunction “and,” shows that the verse elevates both Allah and the Messiah, son of Mary, above all other lords, and implicitly commands their worship. The text, therefore, provides scriptural evidence within the Qur’an itself that Jesus is to be worshiped as Lord, alongside Allah. This reading has profound implications for Christian-Muslim dialogue and invites renewed reflection on the identity of the Messiah in Islamic theology.Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteReferencesThe Qur’an, Surah At-Tawbah 9:31Basic Arabic GrammarDiscussions on conjunctions and logical structure in Semitic languages",

    "full_content": "IntroductionThe identification of Jesus as Jehovah (Yahweh)—the God of Israel—stands at the heart of historic Christian belief. However, this claim is highly contested and interpreted differently withinIslamic, Jewish, and secular scholarship. An academically robust discussion must not only examine the internal logic and scriptural claims of Christianity, but also fairly engage the perspectives and arguments of other traditions and critical scholars. This chapter presents a multi-angled exploration, outlining the Christian position while interacting with major objections and interpretations from other worldviews.1. Old Testament Prophecies: Messianic Expectations in Dialogue1.1 Christian PerspectiveChristians point to Isaiah 7:14, Isaiah 9:6, and Micah 5:2 as prophecies foretelling the incarnation of God. As shown previously, the titles “Immanuel” (“God with us”), “Mighty God,” and “from everlasting” are taken as clear pointers to the divine nature of the coming Messiah.1.2 Jewish ScholarshipJewish exegesis, both ancient and modern, interprets these prophecies differently:Isaiah 7:14: Most Jewish interpreters argue that the prophecy referred to a contemporary event in Isaiah’s time, with “Immanuel” likely being a child born as a sign to King Ahaz, rather than a distant messianic figure. The Hebrew wordalmahis understood as “young woman,” not necessarily “virgin.”1Isaiah 9:6: While Christians see this as a messianic and divine prophecy, Jewish commentators like Rashi and Ibn Ezra have argued that the “child” refers to Hezekiah or another historical king, and that the grand titles are either royal hyperbole or ascriptions to God, not the child himself.2Micah 5:2: Some rabbinic texts do associate this passage with the Messiah but stress that “from of old” (mi-yemai olam) refers to ancient Davidic lineage or God’s foreknowledge, not the Messiah’s pre-existence as God.31.3 Islamic PerspectiveIslamic theology does not accept any claim that God would incarnate or become human. Muslims revere Jesus (Isa) as a great prophet and Messiah, born miraculously of Mary (Qur’an 3:45–47), but strictly reject his divinity (Qur’an 5:72–73). Muslim apologists often argue that the Old Testament prophecies are misread by Christians, and that Jesus himself never claimed to be God in a manner consistent with later Trinitarian dogma.The Qur’an (4:171) explicitly instructs:“Say not ‘Three’: desist—it will be better for you; for Allah is One God…”Muslim exegetes often claim that the “Immanuel” prophecy points only to a sign of God’s nearness or support, not incarnation, and that Jesus’ miracles demonstrate prophetic authority, not divinity.1.4 Secular and Critical ScholarshipSecular biblical scholars, employing historical-critical methods, often argue:Many Old Testament passages cited as messianic prophecies are better understood in their original historical contexts, not as predictions of Jesus specifically.The Christian reading is often seen as a case of “pesher” or typological exegesis, where early Christians reinterpreted Hebrew texts in light of their experiences of Jesus.4Some scholars argue that ideas of a divine or semi-divine Messiah were not widespread in Second Temple Judaism, though recent studies (e.g., Larry Hurtado, Richard Bauckham) have shown that early Jewish Christians very early attributed divine status to Jesus in ways that require serious historical explanation.52. New Testament Declarations: Competing Interpretations2.1 Christian PositionChristian doctrine, as previously outlined, affirms that the New Testament writers—especially John and Paul—directly identify Jesus as God (Theos) and the pre-existent Logos through whom all things were made (John 1:1–14; Colossians 1:15–20; Hebrews 1:1–4).2.2 Jewish ObjectionsJudaism maintains strict monotheism (the Shema: Deut. 6:4). Jewish polemic from the second century onward rejected any notion that a human could be worshipped as God. The Talmudic tradition often portrays Jesus as a controversial figure, but never as divine, and argues that worship of Jesus is a violation of the first commandment.62.3 Islamic ObjectionsIslamic apologetics claim:The New Testament never records Jesus directly saying, “I am God, worship me.”The “Son of God” language is understood metaphorically or as a title for pious people, not as ontological equality with God. Qur’an 9:30–31 denounces any belief in divine sonship for Jesus.Muslim scholars like Shabir Ally or Zakir Naik highlight the “subordination” statements in the Gospels (e.g., John 14:28: “the Father is greater than I”) as evidence against Jesus’ divinity.2.4 Secular/Critical AnalysisBart Ehrman and other secular historians argue that the divinity of Jesus is a development within the early church, not necessarily Jesus’ own claim. Ehrman suggests the earliest Christian writings (such as Mark’s Gospel) portray Jesus as a divinely appointed human, while later texts (such as John’s Gospel) present a higher Christology.7Larry Hurtado and Richard Bauckham, as noted, challenge this, showing that worship of Jesus as divine began remarkably early among Jewish monotheists, suggesting the roots of this belief are not merely later mythologization but foundational to Christian identity.83. Jesus’ Divine Claims: Theological and Interfaith Debates3.1 “I Am” SayingsChristian:Jesus’ use of “I AM” (Greek:ego eimi) in John 8:58 is understood as a direct claim to divinity, referencing the divine name in Exodus 3:14.Jewish:Contemporary Jewish readers and some scholars view this as a claim to special authority or pre-existence in God’s plan, but not as a direct assertion of being YHWH.9Muslim:Muslims argue that “I am” could mean “I have been” (i.e., predestination), or refer to Jesus’ status as Messiah, not to divinity.3.2 Worship and ForgivenessChristian:Jesus accepts worship (Matthew 14:33), forgives sins (Mark 2:5–11), and claims all authority (Matthew 28:18)—all actions reserved for God.Jewish and Muslim:Both traditions consider these stories as later Christian embellishments or misunderstandings, insisting that true monotheism prohibits the worship of any but God. Jewish tradition highlights that no Jewish prophet ever accepted worship, and Islam notes that Jesus always points away from himself to God in heaven (see Mark 10:18, “Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone.”).3.3 The Father’s TestimonyChristian:Hebrews 1:8, where the Father calls the Son “God,” is seen as explicit and definitive.Jewish:Hebrew poetry can attribute divine characteristics to kings as God’s agents (cf. Psalm 45:6–7), but always within the strict bounds of monotheism.10Muslim:Qur’anic teaching insists that any such attribution is either metaphorical or a textual corruption.4. Secular, Historical, and Interfaith Dialogue4.1 Historical DevelopmentSecular historians recognize that the identification of Jesus as God is the most remarkable and distinctive aspect of early Christianity. The rapid emergence of “binitarian” or “incipient Trinitarian” devotion among Jewish Christians is unique among world religions and demands explanation.11 Secular scholars debate whether this was based on genuine experiences of Jesus (e.g., resurrection appearances) or was an adaptation of Hellenistic religious ideas.4.2 Interfaith DialogueChristian theologians like N.T. Wright argue that the New Testament redefines Jewish monotheism around Jesus, rather than breaking from it.12Jewish-Christian dialogue today explores Jesus as a historical Jew and attempts to reclaim him for Jewish thought while still rejecting divine status.Islamic-Christian dialogue stresses the unity and transcendence of God (tawhid) and invites Christians to monotheism as defined by the Qur’an, while many Christians seek to clarify the Trinitarian doctrine as consistent with monotheism (not tritheism).ConclusionThe question of whether Jesus is Jehovah is not only central to Christian theology but is also a defining point of difference between Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. The Christian case draws on a rich tapestry of prophecy, apostolic testimony, and theological reflection, asserting that the fullness of God is revealed in Christ. Jewish and Islamic scholarship, as well as secular critical scholarship, challenge these readings on exegetical, theological, and historical grounds.For the serious seeker, the issue invites further study, honest engagement with sources, and respect for the mystery at the heart of the world’s great monotheistic traditions.FootnotesAdele Berlin and Marc Zvi Brettler, eds.,The Jewish Study Bible(Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004), on Isaiah 7:14.Rashi and Ibn Ezra, commentaries on Isaiah 9:6, inThe Tanakh: The Holy Scriptures(Philadelphia: JPS, 1985).Michael Fishbane,The JPS Bible Commentary: Haftarot(Philadelphia: JPS, 2002), on Micah 5:2.Geza Vermes,Jesus the Jew(Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1973), 37–51; James Kugel,How to Read the Bible(New York: Free Press, 2007), 669–710.Larry W.

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteTHE SIJIDA (PROSTRATION) OF MUSLIMS AS THE MARK OF THE ANTICHRIST: EVIDENCE FROM BIBLICAL FOREHEAD PROPHECYThe act of prostration, orsijida, observed in Islamic worship, has been identified by some as a visible sign that may correspond to the biblical \"mark of the beast,\" as referenced in the Book of Revelation. According to this perspective, the so-called \"False Prophet\"—a figure described in Christian eschatology—induces people to receive this mark upon their foreheads.The principal biblical passage discussing the \"mark of the beast\" is found in Revelation 13:15-18, while supplementary references include Revelation 14:9, 14:11, 15:2, 16:2, 19:20, and 20:4. This mark operates as a seal upon the followers of the Antichrist and the False Prophet (the spokesman for the Antichrist). The False Prophet is the one who compels people to receive this mark—interpreted here assijida—on their foreheads.The mark of the beast, according to the book of Revelation, will be granted only to those who worship the Antichrist—here identified with Allah, the deity of Islam in this controversial perspective. In the eschatological end-times, this mark will serve as a credential or permit, without which no one may buy or sell (cf. the advent ofIslamic bankingsystems). Only those who worship the Antichrist—that is, Muslims—will receive it.Notably, the False Prophet is described as the one who compels the followers of Allah to take this mark. Importantly, this mark is placed on the forehead, not carried as a card or physical token. The pertinent question then arises: which prophet and which religion bear this mark ofsijida?Shalom,Maxwell Shimba, servant of Jesus ChristScholarly and Theological Expansion1.Biblical Forehead Prophecy: Scriptural FoundationThe Book of Revelation is replete with apocalyptic imagery and symbolism, none more contested or discussed than the “mark of the beast” (Greek:charagma tou thēriou). Revelation 13:16-17 reads:\"And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.\" (NKJV)The mark, placed upon theforehead, functions as a visible identifier, denoting allegiance to the beast—a figure widely recognized in Christian eschatology as the Antichrist. Other passages reinforce this theme (see Revelation 14:9-11, 15:2, 16:2, 19:20, and 20:4). Theologically, the forehead symbolizes the mind, will, and open allegiance; it is the seat of identity and devotion (cf. Deuteronomy 6:8).2.Historical and Comparative Religious ContextThe practice of prostration in prayer (sijida) is integral to Islamic worship. During thesalah, Muslims touch their foreheads to the ground, often resulting in a visible callous or mark (zabiba) on the forehead, regarded by some as a sign of devoutness.In comparative religious studies, physical markers of religious allegiance—such astefillinin Judaism or thesign of the crossin Christianity—function symbolically to demarcate the faithful. However, in Revelation, the mark is specifically tied to eschatological apostasy and false worship.3.Theological Interpretation: The Mark as Eschatological AllegianceWithin Christian eschatology, particularly in dispensational and futurist readings, the mark on the forehead is not merely literal but spiritual—a public, visible, and embodied loyalty to the Antichrist. Scholarly debate abounds regarding the nature of this mark: is it a literal implant, a symbol, or a public religious act?The identification of Islamicsijidawith the biblical mark is a controversial interpretation advanced by some Christian polemicists. Proponents argue:The act of touching the forehead to the ground in allegiance to a non-Christian deity constitutes the visible “mark” of rebellion against Christ.The growing prominence of Islamic finance (Islamic banking), which aligns with religious law, prefigures the economic dimension of the prophecy—where commerce is contingent upon religious allegiance.However, other scholars caution against conflating scriptural prophecy with contemporary religious practices, emphasizing the dangers of supersessionism and religious stereotyping (see Craig Koester,Revelation and the End of All Things, 2018).4.Academic and Interfaith Dialogue: Spectrum of ViewsIn academic discourse, interpretations of Revelation range widely:Evangelical and Dispensationalistwriters often literalize the mark, viewing it as a future physical or technological identifier (e.g., RFID chips).Historico-criticalscholars, such as Elaine Pagels, interpret the mark symbolically as participation in the imperial cult or societal conformity (Pagels,Revelations: Visions, Prophecy, and Politics in the Book of Revelation, 2012).Islamic scholarshiprejects all connections between Islamic practice and Antichrist prophecy, emphasizing the monotheistic continuity of Islam with Abrahamic faiths (see Seyyed Hossein Nasr,Islam: Religion, History, and Civilization, 2003).5.Conclusion: The Forehead Mark—A Prophetic WarningWhile the direct identification of Muslimsijidaas the \"mark of the beast\" remains controversial and debated, the symbolism of the forehead in biblical prophecy remains clear: it is the locus of public allegiance, identity, and worship. Christians are warned to guard their minds and allegiance, resisting false prophets and counterfeit worship (cf. 2 Thessalonians 2:3-4).References & FootnotesKoester, Craig R.Revelation and the End of All Things.

They only need to believe that God exists, that there will be a Day when He will resurrect and judge humanity (\"the Last Day\"), and to do what is right.Yet this directly contradicts other statements which say that Islam is the only religion accepted and even speaks against embracing the faiths of Judaism and Christianity!\"And they say, 'None will enter Paradise except one who is a Jew or a Christian.' These are their wishful thinking. Say, [O Muhammad], 'Produce your proof, if you should be truthful.' Yes, [on the contrary], whoever submits his face in Islam to Allah while being a doer of good will have his reward with his Lord. And no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve...\" [See Tafsir Ibn Kathir, Vol.1, Page 154]. \"The Jews say the Christians follow nothing [true]; and the Christians say the Jews follow nothing [true]; though both recite the Scripture. Thus the polytheists speak the same as they do. But Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ.\" (Qur'an 2:111-113)\"Indeed, the religion in the sight of Allah is Islam. And those who were given the Scripture did not differ except after knowledge had come to them—out of jealous animosity between themselves. And whoever disbelieves in the verses of Allah, then indeed, Allah is swift in [taking] account.\" (Qur'an 3:19)\"Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was one inclining toward truth, a Muslim [submitting to Allah]. And he was not of the polytheists.\" (Qur'an 3:67)\"So is it other than the religion of Allah they desire, while to Him have submitted [all] those within the heavens and earth, willingly or by compulsion, and to Him they will be returned? Say, 'We have believed in Allah and in what was revealed to us and what was revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Descendants [Al-Asbat], and in what was given to Moses and Jesus and to the prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and to Him we have submitted [in Islam].' And whoever desires other than Islam as religion—never will it be accepted from him, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers.\" (Qur'an 3:83-85)\"...This day those who disbelieve have despaired of [defeating] your religion; so fear them not, but fear Me. This day I have perfected for you your religion and completed My favor upon you and have approved for you Islam as religion...\" (Qur'an 5:3)Moreover, the Quran says that Jews and Christians are condemned for believing in the divinity of God's messengers like Jesus and Ezra:\"They have certainly disbelieved who say, 'Allah is the Messiah, the son of Mary.' But the Messiah said, 'O Children of Israel, worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.' Indeed, he who associates others with Allah—Allah has forbidden him Paradise, and his refuge is the Fire. And there are not for the wrongdoers any helpers. They have certainly disbelieved who say, 'Allah is the third of three.' And there is no god except one God. And if they do not desist from what they are saying, there will surely afflict the disbelievers among them a painful punishment.\" (Qur'an 5:72-73)\"The Jews say, 'Ezra is the son of Allah'; and the Christians say, 'The Messiah is the son of Allah.' That is their statement from their mouths; they imitate the saying of those who disbelieved [before them]. May Allah destroy them; how are they deluded?\" (Qur'an 9:30)Given the above, how can the Quran promise Jews and Christians a reward from their Lord for believing and doing good while they are not Muslims and hold to the divinity of specific messengers?To avoid this problem, some Muslims interpret the word \"Islam\" not as the religion itself, but as a reference to submission, which is its literal meaning. By this understanding, anyone who submits to God is a Muslim, whose path is essentially Islam even if they call themselves Jews or Christians.The main issue with this claim is that this is not how the Quran defines Islam—as merely general submission—but as a religion distinct from Judaism and Christianity, as Q. 2:111 and 3:67 show. It is even specifically introduced as a religion in Q. 3:19 and 83-85.Indeed, the Quran claims that the name Muslim was given to prophets long before Muhammad:\"And strive for Allah with the striving due to Him. He has chosen you and has not placed upon you in the religion any difficulty. [It is] the religion of your father, Abraham. Allah named you Muslims before [in former scriptures] and in this [revelation] that the Messenger may be a witness over you and you may be witnesses over the people. So establish prayer and give zakah and hold fast to Allah. He is your protector; and excellent is the protector, and excellent is the helper.\" (Qur'an 22:78)This is how some early Muslim commentators explained these writings:\"(He has named you Muslims before and in this [Qur'an])\"Narrated by Imam Abdullah bin Al-Mubarak from Ibn Jurayj, from ‘Ata’ from Ibn Abbas regarding Allah’s saying...\"(He named you Muslims before)\"\"This refers to Allah, exalted is He.\" This was also the opinion of Mujahid, `Ata', Ad-Dahhak, As-Suddi, Muqatil bin Hayyan, and Qatadah. Mujahid said: \"Allah named you Muslims before, in the previous scriptures and in Adh-Dhikr [the reminder, the Quran].\"For more detail, see: [Tafsir Ibn Kathir (Abridged), Surah Al-Isra’ 39 to the end of Surah Al-Mu’minun, summarized by a group of scholars under Shaykh Safiur-Rahman Al-Mubarakpuri [Darussalam, Riyadh, Houston, New York, Lahore; First Edition: July 2000], Vol. 6, pp. 625-626; emphasis added]So, the Quran teaches that even before Muhammad, the prophets and believers were called \"Muslims\"! In other words, their religion was not Judaism or Christianity but Islam, and that is why they were called Muslims. This also explains why Q. 3:67 calls Abraham a Muslim and shows that the Quran does not define \"Islam\" in merely a general sense, such that anyone who submits to God is, in fact, a Muslim regardless of whether he calls himself a Jew, Christian, Hindu, etc. For more on this, see:http://answering-islam.org/Quran/Contra/muslims_before.htmOthers may argue that the Quran is only referring to those Jews and Christians who affirm the absolute oneness of God, or the Islamic concept of tawhid, and not those who embrace the divinity of prophets such as Jesus. The problem with this claim is that these verses do not provide such a qualification, i.e., that only those Jews and Christians who believe in Islamic tawhid will receive a reward from their Lord. Furthermore, it is a matter of historical record that Orthodox Jews and Christians uphold the unity of God, despite Muslims’ dissatisfaction with those groups' doctrine of God and their criticism of such teachings as the Christian Trinity.Moreover, the Quran warns against accepting only some prophets and books of Allah, and rejecting others:\"Then is it only a part of the Scripture that you believe in, and do you disbelieve in the rest? Then what is the recompense of those who do so among you except disgrace in worldly life; and on the Day of Resurrection they will be sent back to the severest torment. And Allah is not unaware of what you do.\" (Qur'an 2:85)\"Indeed, those who disbelieve in Allah and His messengers and wish to discriminate between Allah and His messengers and say, 'We believe in some and disbelieve in others,' and wish to adopt a way in between—\" (Qur'an 4:150)Historically, the Jewish religion has rejected John the Baptist, Jesus Christ, and Muhammad as messengers from God, while Christianity rejects Muhammad as a true prophet/messenger. Furthermore, Jews do not accept the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ or the Quran, just as Christians reject the Quran as revelation. So how can people remain in these religions without violating the earlier Quranic statements? And how can God promise that such people have nothing to fear but will receive a reward from Him?Furthermore, by rejecting some prophets and books, such people have become unbelievers (kuffar). The Quran emphatically says that Allah will not accept the good deeds of unbelievers:\"It is not for the polytheists to maintain the mosques of Allah while witnessing against themselves with disbelief. For such their deeds have become worthless, and in the Fire shall they abide.\" (Qur'an 9:17)\"[Their situation] is like those before you: they were mightier than you in power and more abundant in wealth and children. They had their share [of enjoyment] in their portion, so you have enjoyed your share as those before you enjoyed their share; and you have engaged in vanities as they engaged in vanities. It is those whose deeds have become worthless in this world and in the Hereafter, and it is they who are the losers.\" (Qur'an 9:69)\"They will say, 'Did there not come to you your messengers with clear proofs?' They will say, 'Yes.' They will reply, 'Then supplicate [yourselves], but the supplication of the disbelievers is nothing but in vain.'\" (Qur'an 40:50)Again, how can one remain a Jew or Christian and have their righteous deeds accepted while rejecting some of the prophets and scriptures which the Quran says must be fully embraced and believed?All quotations taken from the Hilali-Khan translation of the Quran.Shalom,Dr. Maxwell Shimba for Max Shimba Ministries",

A Christian, who may not know any better, quickly responds, “Wa'alaykum Salaam,” believing wholeheartedly that they have received a greeting identical to the one Muslims exchange amongst themselves, namely, “Assalaam aleykum” (السلام عليكم), which means “May the peace of Allah be upon you.”My fellow Christian, understand that a Muslim, knowing you are a Christian, will never greet you with “Assalaam Aleykum”—that is, wishing you the peace of the god they worship. Instead, the Muslim will greet a Christian by saying:Sam Aleykum(سم عليكم), meaning in Swahili, “Death be upon you.” When addressing several Christians, this is the form used.If addressing a single Christian, they will say,Sam Alaika(سم عليك), meaning “Death be upon you.”Unaware, the Christian happily responds, thinking a good greeting has been given, when in fact, a curse has been pronounced (“You deserve death...”).Therefore, from today, when you are greeted by a Muslim with “Sam aleykum,” respond by saying:Wa ‘alaykum Faqatu(عليكم فقة), meaning, “May that death return to you.”Even if the greeting given is the standard “Assalaam aleykum” (meaning “peace of Allah be upon you”), do not respond in kind, because the peace Muslims offer (that of the world) is different from the peace Jesus gave to His disciples, when He said:Salaamu'n Lakum(سلام لكم), meaning “Peace be upon you.”There is a difference between the “salaam” of Jesus and that of Muslims. Jesus said:“Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives.” (John 14:27)Therefore,be very cautious with their greetings.Theological and Academic ExpansionBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological Institute1.Historical Background and Linguistic AnalysisThe act of greeting in Semitic cultures, both ancient and modern, holds significant spiritual and social weight. The phrase“Assalaam aleykum”(peace be upon you) is derived from the Arabic rootslm, meaning “peace.” Historically, both Jews and Christians from the Middle Eastern region have used similar greetings—shalom aleichemin Hebrew, andsalaam alaykumin Arabic.However, the claim that Muslims intentionally use “Sam aleykum” or “Sam alaika” (interpreted as “death be upon you”) when greeting non-Muslims is controversial and debated among scholars. Linguistically, “Sam” (سم) can mean “poison” or “death” in Arabic, but in everyday Muslim practice, the standard greeting, even towards non-Muslims, remains “Assalaam aleykum.” Academic sources, includingLane’s Arabic-English Lexicon, affirm this.TheHadithliterature does mention incidents in which enemies of the Prophet Muhammad would substitute “Sam” for “Salaam” as a form of mockery or curse (seeSahih Bukhari, Book 56, Hadith 759). In response, Muhammad advised his followers simply to respond, “Wa ‘alaykum” (“And upon you”). However, the teaching and mainstream practice among Muslims worldwide is to use “Assalaam aleykum” as a greeting of peace, and there is no universal doctrine promoting the curse form towards Christians.2.Theological Comparison: The Peace of Christ vs. Worldly PeaceJesus’ teaching on peace is distinctively spiritual. InJohn 14:27, Jesus declares:“Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives.”The peace of Christ (eirenein Greek,shalomin Hebrew) is not simply the absence of conflict or a polite social exchange. It is an inner, abiding peace with God, rooted in reconciliation through Christ’s sacrificial work. It is unconditional, transcendent, and not dependent on outward circumstances.The greeting “Assalaam aleykum” is, in Islamic theology, a supplication for safety, wellness, and harmony, but its theological center is different from that of Christianity. For Muslims, peace is a social, communal value but is tied to submission (Islam) to Allah’s will. For Christians, peace is the gift of the indwelling Holy Spirit, a fruit of salvation (seeRomans 5:1, Galatians 5:22).3.Missiological and Social ImplicationsA. Discernment in GreetingsChristians are called to discernment (1 John 4:1), especially regarding spiritual matters. While cultural sensitivity and courtesy are commendable, Christians must understand the origins and intentions of spiritual practices. However, accusations or suspicion without evidence can breed unnecessary hostility.B. Responding to Greetings BiblicallyJesus taught His followers to bless even those who curse them (Luke 6:28). The early Christians were taught, “If someone wishes you peace, let your peace return to them” (Matthew 10:12-13). Thus, the Christian response to greetings—even from those of other faiths—should reflect the spirit of Christ: grace, truth, and love.4.Academic Perspective: Interfaith RelationsAcademically, it is important to approach such claims with critical investigation. While polemical writings have historically exaggerated or misinterpreted Muslim practices, primary sources do not support the view that Muslims systematically curse Christians in greetings. Interfaith dialogue and scholarship emphasize mutual respect and the promotion of peace (seeEsposito, “Islam: The Straight Path,” Oxford, 2021).5.Conclusion: The Christian DistinctiveChristians are ambassadors of Christ’s peace (2 Corinthians 5:20). The peace offered by Jesus is not simply a formulaic phrase but a living reality, distinguishing Christian life from religious formalism. While Christians should exercise discernment, they must also exemplify the love and peace of Christ, even in their responses to greetings from people of other faiths.“Let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to answer everyone.” (Colossians 4:6)Footnotes:Lane, E.W.An Arabic-English Lexicon.

How could he forgive someone else’s sins?MUHAMMAD ASKED FOR FORGIVENESS ONE HUNDRED TIMES A DAY:In “Sahih Muslim, Book 35, Hadith 6522,” it says that the Prophet Muhammad was so sinful that he would ask Allah for forgiveness a hundred times every day.Quote:“Today is today, whoever says tomorrow is a liar.”My brothers and sisters, the more I study Islam, the more doubts I have, because there is nothing good at all in this religion of Muhammad and Jibril (Gabriel).

In Muhammad’s case, this is difficult because the Qur’an says that he is an example in his life and actions:So, how could Muhammad have a shadow over his heart?How did he get this distress while he was supposedly receiving revelation from Allah?Is it possible that this revelation was itself the source of the distress filling his heart?Qur’an 68:4:\"Your life and your deeds are [an example].\" (Mohammed Knut Bernstöm, Qur’an)All people have sinnedThe Bible says that all people have sinned. This includes the Prophet Muhammad—he was sinful like everyone else, but Muhammad himself admitted that his sins were not forgiven even though he asked for forgiveness a hundred times a day.Dear reader, why should we follow or listen to Muhammad, who admitted that his sins were not forgiven?Why did Allah fail to forgive Muhammad’s sins?Does Allah have the power to forgive sins?Muhammad is the only prophet who died with sin, and the wages of sin is death in Hell. Romans 6:23:“For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.”Because the sinner is condemned to death. “For the wages of sin is death” (Romans 6:23).This means separation from God in Hell forever. “Just as people are destined to die once, and after that to face judgment” (Hebrews 9:27).Therefore, why die in your sins like Muhammad and be separated from God in Hell?My friend:I ask you the most important question of your life. Your eternal joy or eternal sorrow depends on the answer to this question.

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionWithin Islamic theology, the Quran is venerated as the final, unaltered, and most complete revelation from God. Muslims assert that it is a“muhaymin”(guardian or confirmer) over previous scriptures (Quran 5:48). However, a critical and scholarly examination reveals significant gaps in the Quran’s content—particularly regarding foundational narratives, historical details, and doctrinal essentials that are indispensable for any comprehensive religious worldview. This raises profound theological questions:If the Quran is indeed complete and final, why do Muslims recurrently resort to the Bible to supplement their beliefs?What are the implications for the coherence and sufficiency of Islamic doctrine?I. The Missing Foundations: What the Quran Leaves UnansweredThe Quran, while referencing many biblical figures and events, is notoriously silent on fundamental details that are explicitly found in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) and the New Testament. Consider the following:Identity and Lineage:The Quran mentions Adam, but does not name his wife (Eve). It speaks of Abraham, but omits the number and names of his sons, only emphasizing Ishmael and Isaac. It references Jacob, but never lists the names of his twelve sons—the patriarchs of the tribes of Israel.The Ten Commandments:Nowhere in the Quran is the Decalogue, the list of Ten Commandments, given as a unit. Although fragments of the ethical code appear, the unique and formative role of the Decalogue in religious history is missing.Historical Narratives:The exile of Israel to Babylon, the experiences of Daniel, the return from exile, and many prophetic narratives are alluded to but left almost entirely unexplained or omitted in the Quranic text.The Gospel Message:The Quran commands belief in the “Injil” (Gospel) given to Jesus, but fails to preserve or articulate the content of this message. It neither recounts the Sermon on the Mount nor the parables and teachings central to Christian faith.These are not minor omissions—they are foundational to understanding God’s unfolding plan, the nature of humanity, the covenant, and the requirements of divine law.II. Theological Implications: The Necessity of the Bible in Islamic ThoughtGiven these omissions, Islamic scholarship has long relied on“Isra’iliyyat”—Jewish and Christian traditions—to fill gaps in Quranic narratives. Classic tafsir (Quranic exegesis), such as those by Ibn Kathir and Al-Tabari, are replete with references to Biblical material. This raises a theological crisis:The Quran’s Claim to Completeness:The Quran repeatedly claims to be“a clarification of all things”(Quran 16:89) and“perfected”(Quran 5:3). Yet, its dependence on earlier revelation for context and content contradicts this claim. If the Quran is truly self-sufficient, why is recourse to the Bible necessary, either for exegesis or basic religious knowledge?The Doctrine of Tahrif (Corruption):Muslims often claim that the Bible has been corrupted (tahrif), yet continually turn to it for clarification of stories and doctrines that the Quran leaves ambiguous or unexplained. This reliance is both inconsistent and self-defeating: If the Bible is corrupt, its testimony should be irrelevant. If it is needed, then the Quran is incomplete without it.III. The Quran as a Dependent Text: Evidence from Islamic PracticeThroughout Islamic history, the practice of borrowing from the Bible is ubiquitous. Whether discussing the lives of the prophets, the creation narrative, or the moral law, Islamic tradition continually seeks validation and completion from the Bible.Examples:The Names of the Prophets’ Wives and Children:In every major Islamic commentary, details absent from the Quran are imported from Genesis, Exodus, and other biblical books.The Structure of Sharia:Islamic law incorporates elements of Mosaic law, including rituals, dietary rules, and penal codes—all originally expounded in the Torah, not the Quran.Eschatology and Christology:Concepts such as the Messiah, the Day of Judgment, and the final resurrection are understood in light of New Testament teaching, not by Quranic exposition alone.IV. Theological and Logical Consequences1.Sufficiency and Finality Challenged:The Quran cannot, by itself, answer the basic questions of faith, history, and doctrine. If a “final revelation” is truly final, it should not require constant supplementation from a previous, supposedly obsolete, or corrupted text.2.Epistemological Insecurity:Muslims face a dilemma: either trust the Bible and undermine their doctrine of tahrif, or reject it and remain without answers to crucial religious questions.3.Christological Vacuum:The Quran’s affirmation of Jesus as Messiah (Quran 3:45; 4:171) is left theologically empty unless interpreted through the New Testament, which the Quran does not preserve or explain.V. Conclusion: Why We Need the Bible—And Why the Quran Alone Is InadequateIn summary, the Quran’s self-declared sufficiency is theologically and textually untenable. Its silence on essential issues leaves Islam dependent upon the very Bible it claims to supersede. Thus, the Bible remains indispensable—not only for Christians and Jews but for any honest seeker who desires to understand the very roots of the Quranic narrative.If the Quran were the only book of God, religious knowledge and salvation history would be irreparably impoverished. The reliance of Islam on the Bible is both unavoidable and fatal to its claim of scriptural finality. The Bible is needed for everything; the Quran, without the Bible, is left with nothing but unanswered questions.ReferencesQuran 16:89– “And We have sent down to you the Book as clarification for all things…”Quran 5:3– “This day I have perfected for you your religion…”Ibn Kathir,Tafsir al-Qur’an al-Azim(exegesis using biblical material)Al-Tabari,Jami’ al-Bayan(reliance on “Isra’iliyyat”)Bible, Genesis 1-50; Exodus 1-40; Matthew, Mark, Luke, John.Dr. Maxwell Shimba,Shimba Theological Institute",

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionAmong the more curious features of classical Islamic exegesis is the tradition concerning the procreation of Satan (Iblis) and the divine orchestration behind it. This narrative, found in works such as Tafsir Al-Qurtubi on Q18:50, presents Satan as a being created by Allah with both male and female sexual organs, capable of self-propagation and the continual spawning of demonic offspring. This article undertakes a critical, theological, and scholarly examination of this tradition, interrogating its sources, logic, and implications for Islamic theodicy and divine purpose.The Narrative in Question: Source and ContentAccording to Tafsir al-Qurtubi on Qur’an 18:50:Mujahid said:“Satan inserted his male private part into his female private part and laid five eggs, this is the origin of his offspring.”Another report states:“Allah created for him a male private part in his right thigh and a female private part in his left thigh. Satan has sexual intercourse (using these organs), lays 10 eggs every day, and from each egg 70 devils are born.”Such narrations are echoed by other classical scholars (e.g., Al-Tabari, Al-Kalbi, Ibn Kathir) and find resonance in various hadith and folkloric traditions, despite not being mentioned explicitly in the Qur’an itself.The Theological Problem: Why Did Allah Create Satan’s Procreative Power?1.Purpose and Divine WisdomThe first and most fundamental question is:Why would Allah, described as All-Wise (Al-Hakim), All-Knowing (Al-‘Alim), and the Most Merciful (Ar-Rahman), purposefully create within Satan the biological capacity for self-propagation?If Satan’s sole role is to mislead humanity and rebel against the divine, does the provision of a sexual apparatus and the subsequent multiplication of devils serve any redemptive, just, or wise end?a.Theodicy and the Problem of EvilIslamic theodicy argues that all things Allah creates are ultimately for good, even if their immediate effects appear evil. But the creation of thousands of new devils daily, whose existence serves to increase evil, temptation, and suffering, seems contrary to the divine attributes of mercy and justice.b.Comparison with Christian TheologyIn Christian theology, Satan is not depicted as self-propagating or laying eggs. The demonic realm consists of fallen angels—unique creations—without the concept of sexual reproduction or endless demonic multiplication. This avoids the implication that God is continuously manufacturing evil entities.2.Textual Authenticity and Intellectual Coherencea.Scriptural SilenceThe Qur’an itself never states that Satan self-propagates by laying eggs or through sexual intercourse. This doctrine emerges from extraneous tafsir and weak or fabricated hadiths, raising questions about its canonical status.b.Anthropomorphism and MythologyThe description of Satan’s anatomy and procreation borrows heavily from ancient Near Eastern mythologies and anthropomorphic imaginations. It brings the divine creative act to the level of fable, blurring the lines between theology and folklore.3.Quantifying Satan’s Offspring: How Many?If, as claimed, Satan lays 10 eggs per day and from each egg 70 devils are born, then:10 eggs × 70 devils = 700 devils/dayIn one year: 700 × 365 = 255,500 devilsOver 1,400 years (since Islam’s advent): 255,500 × 1,400 ≈ 357,700,000 devilsThese numbers become absurd when extended to the scale of world history, raising further theological and rational dilemmas.4.The Challenge to Islamic Thought: What is the Benefit?a.Divine Intention vs. Satanic AutonomyIf Allah intentionally created Satan’s procreative ability, then the proliferation of devils is adirectresult of divine will, not merely the outcome of Satan’s rebellion. Does this implicate Allah in the proliferation of evil? What possible divine benefit or wisdom could justify the ongoing creation of more and more devils?b.Human Accountability and JusticeIf humans are held responsible for succumbing to satanic temptation, while Allah simultaneously increases the number of tempters, can divine justice be maintained? Does this not create an imbalance where the test of faith is perpetually stacked against humanity?5.A Call for Re-examinationIslamic theologians must grapple with the narrative’s origins and implications. A doctrine that places the multiplication of evil within the creative prerogative of Allah calls into question divine justice, mercy, and wisdom. Unless this narrative is rejected as folkloric, Islam faces a profound theological challenge:What conceivable benefit or higher wisdom is served by the exponential, daily increase of Satan’s offspring?ConclusionThe account of Satan’s sexual self-propagation, as recorded in Tafsir al-Qurtubi and echoed in other classical sources, exposes a significant theological tension within Islam. The lack of clear Qur’anic basis, the problematic implications for theodicy and justice, and the anthropomorphic absurdity of the narrative together demand a critical scholarly response.Islamic scholars are challenged to either provide a coherent, divinely beneficial explanation for this doctrine or, alternatively, to repudiate it as a mythological accretion unworthy of divine revelation.Such re-examination is essential not only for the internal coherence of Islamic theology but also for its credibility in dialogue with other world religions and rational inquiry.Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteReferences:Al-Qurtubi,Tafsir al-Qurtubi, commentary on Q18:50.Al-Tabari,Tafsir al-Tabari.Ibn Kathir,Tafsir Ibn Kathir.Watt, W.

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThe manner in which a religious tradition instructs its adherents to treat enemies is a powerful indicator of its divine or human origins. In particular, the ethical directives of Jesus Christ regarding love for enemies stand in stark contrast to the martial injunctions found in the Quran. This article presents a theological critique of Islam’s claim to divine origin, focusing especially onSurah 9:14(Q9:14) and its implications, while contrasting these with the teachings of Jesus as preserved in the New Testament. The conclusion is drawn that Allah, as depicted in the Quran, is not the God of the Bible, and therefore the prophets and apostles before Muhammad were not Muslims.1. The Biblical Ethic of Enemy LoveOne of the hallmarks of the New Testament is Jesus’ radical command tolove one’s enemies. As recorded in Matthew 5:44, Jesus declares, “But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.”1 This theme is reiterated throughout the New Testament and has its antecedents in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament):Luke 6:27-28: “But I say to you who hear, Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you.”2Proverbs 25:21-22: “If your enemy is hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he is thirsty, give him water to drink, for you will heap burning coals on his head, and the Lord will reward you.”3Romans 12:20: “If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink; for by so doing you will heap burning coals on his head.”4These teachings reflect the essential nature of God as “merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness.”5 The ethic of enemy love is not marginal, but central to the Christian revelation, culminating in Christ’s self-sacrificial death for sinners and enemies alike (Romans 5:8).62. The Quranic Ethic: Surah 9:14 and Divine ViolenceIn contrast, the Quran repeatedly sanctions violent struggle against non-believers, particularly in the Medinan surahs.Surah 9:14reads:“Fight them; Allah will punish them by your hands and will disgrace them and give you victory over them and satisfy the breasts of a believing people.”7All major English translations render the message similarly, authorizing fighting, punishment, humiliation, and the satisfaction of the believing community.8 The exegetical tradition (tafsir) reinforces this interpretation. Ibn Kathir, for example, comments that this verse means Allah “will punish them at your hands, you are the ones who will inflict punishment upon them.”9 The message is echoed throughout other surahs (Q2:190-193; Q8:12-13; Q9:5, 29), establishing a pattern that stands at odds with the radical nonviolence of Jesus.10Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) historically codified these commands into laws concerning jihad (offensive and defensive war), as attested by classical scholars such as al-Tabari and al-Mawardi.11 Attempts by modern apologists to recontextualize these verses do not erase the traditional, literal understanding embedded in both Sunni and Shia orthodoxy.123. Allah and the God of the Bible: Theological IncompatibilityA. God as FatherThe Bible reveals God as Father—a personal, relational deity (Matthew 6:9; Romans 8:15).13 The Quran, in contrast, emphatically denies God’s fatherhood (Q5:18; Q6:101; Q19:88-93).14 This theological distinction is foundational.B. God as LoveWhile the Bible asserts that “God is love” (1 John 4:8, 16), the Quran never makes this ontological claim about Allah. Allah is described as “the Loving” (al-Wadud; Q11:90, Q85:14), but love is not presented as His essence.15C. God Incarnate in ChristChristianity proclaims that God was incarnate in Jesus Christ (John 1:1-18; Colossians 2:9). The Quran explicitly rejects the divinity and crucifixion of Christ (Q4:157-158).16 Therefore, the God revealed in Jesus is not the Allah described in the Quran.4. The Prophets and Apostles: Not Muslims, Not Proclaimers of IslamThe claim that the biblical prophets and apostles were Muslims collapses under both historical and textual scrutiny:TheHebrew prophetsandNew Testament apostlesnever professed faith in the Qur’anic Allah or recited the shahada.17Theethical frameworkof the Hebrew Bible, while containing accounts of divinely sanctioned war, never commands perpetual violence against all non-believers. These wars were judicial, historically circumscribed, and ultimately aimed at redemption.18TheNew Covenantinaugurated by Jesus is defined by reconciliation, peacemaking, and the abolition of ethnic, cultural, and religious hostilities (Ephesians 2:14-16; Galatians 3:28).195. Conclusion: Islam as a Contradiction of Divine RevelationThe Qur’anic teaching to “fight them… punish them by your hands… disgrace them” (Q9:14) is incompatible with the divine ethic of enemy love that Jesus proclaimed. The true measure of divine revelation is the perfection of love, mercy, and forgiveness—attributes uniquely revealed in the triune God of the Bible.20 Thus, Allah of the Quran is not the same as the God of the Bible, and Islam cannot be the final or true revelation from the God of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Jesus.Endnote:The invitation stands for all to come to Jesus Christ, who alone reveals the heart of God, brings peace, and heals the wounds of both friend and enemy.FootnotesMatthew 5:44, English Standard Version (ESV).Luke 6:27-28, ESV.Proverbs 25:21-22, ESV.Romans 12:20, ESV.Exodus 34:6, ESV.Romans 5:8, ESV; cf.

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThe question of Jesus Christ's divinity occupies a central position in Christian theology and is a point of contention in Muslim-Christian dialogues. While Islamic sources—namely the Qur’an, Allah, Muhammad, and Jibril—deny Jesus' divinity, their very testimonies, when examined carefully, inadvertently affirm attributes that, according to both scriptural traditions, belong to God alone. Among these is the authority to forgive sins, an act that is foundationally and uniquely reserved for God. This article will critically examine this attribute and its Christological implications through a comparative theological lens, employing both biblical and Qur’anic texts.The Authority to Forgive Sins: A Divine PrerogativeThe Qur’an explicitly declares that forgiveness of sins is the exclusive right of God. In Surah Ghafir (40:2-3), it is written:\"The revelation of the Book is from Allah, the Exalted in Power, the All-Knowing. The Forgiver of sin, Acceptor of repentance, Severe in punishment, Owner of abundance. There is no deity except Him; to Him is the final return.\"Here, the Qur’an affirms that only God can forgive sins. This divine prerogative, as understood in Islamic theology, is beyond the scope of any human agent.In parallel, the Gospel narrative presents an episode where Jesus explicitly exercises the authority to forgive sins, thereby eliciting accusations of blasphemy from the religious authorities of His time. In Mark 2:5-11, the text recounts:\"When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, 'Son, your sins are forgiven.' Now some of the scribes were sitting there, questioning in their hearts, 'Why does this man speak like that? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?' And immediately Jesus, perceiving in His spirit that they thus questioned within themselves, said to them, 'Why do you question these things in your hearts? Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, \"Your sins are forgiven,\" or to say, \"Rise, take up your bed and walk\"? But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins'—He said to the paralytic—'I say to you, rise, pick up your bed, and go home.'\"This narrative is not merely an account of healing but a profound theological assertion of divine identity. Jesus’ forgiveness of sins, an act understood even by His opponents as uniquely divine, serves as a direct demonstration of His divinity.The Incarnation: Concealing the Majesty of the DivineA common objection to Christ’s divinity arises from His humanity—His hunger, fatigue, sorrow, and mortality. Critics argue that the assumption of human nature diminishes His divine authority. However, Christian theology holds that the incarnation does not diminish but rather veils divine majesty for the purpose of redemptive accessibility.This principle is not foreign to the biblical narrative. In Exodus 19:20-21 and Exodus 33:18, 20, God reveals Himself in ways that are both awesome and perilous to humanity, underscoring the necessity of mediation for the sake of human survival:\"You cannot see My face, for man shall not see Me and live.\" (Exodus 33:20)Thus, the incarnation is understood as an act of divine accommodation. In the New Testament, this theological reality is affirmed:\"And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen His glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.\" (John 1:14)\"Great indeed, we confess, is the mystery of godliness: He was manifested in the flesh...\" (1 Timothy 3:16)\"When Christ came into the world, He said, 'A body you have prepared for me...'\" (Hebrews 10:5)\"...but emptied Himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men.\" (Philippians 2:7)The incarnation, therefore, is not a subtraction of divinity but the necessary veil (cf. Hebrews 10:20) that allows sinful humanity to approach God without being consumed by His holiness.The Title \"Son of God\" and Its Ontological ImplicationsThe designation \"Son of God\" has often been misconstrued as implying inferiority or created status. However, the term arises from the act of incarnation—the eternal Word taking on human nature. John 1:14 asserts:\"And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen His glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father...\"This is not a change in essence but a change in role or manifestation, akin to water taking the form of ice: the substance remains the same, though the form is adapted for a particular purpose. Thus, Jesus as the \"Son\" is the incarnate manifestation of the eternal divine nature, His humanity serving as the redemptive \"veil\" (cf. Hebrews 10:20).Affirmations of Christ's Deity in Christian ScriptureThe New Testament repeatedly affirms the divinity of Jesus:\"Whoever has seen me has seen the Father.\" (John 14:7-10)\"…our great God and Savior Jesus Christ.\" (Titus 2:13)\"Thomas answered Him, 'My Lord and my God!'\" (John 20:28)These declarations are not metaphorical but ontological, directly ascribing the nature and identity of God to Jesus Christ.Conclusion: The Exclusivity of Christ’s Salvific RoleGiven the evidence from both Christian and Islamic texts, the case for the divinity of Jesus is compelling when viewed through the lens of His unique prerogative to forgive sins and the necessity of the incarnation for human salvation. Scripture attests:\"And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.\" (Acts 4:12)Thus, Christian doctrine maintains that Jesus Christ is fully God and fully man—the only mediator and Savior for humanity.May God bless you as you seek to understand and embrace the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ as revealed in Scripture.Dr. Maxwell ShimbaFor Shimba Theological InstituteCopyright © 2016 Max Shimba Ministries Org.

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThe question of divine authenticity between Christianity and Islam is one that has shaped theological discourse for centuries. At its core, this question is not about the existence of religion, but about the revelation and nature of God. According to biblical theology, God’s desire has always been for a relationship with humanity, not the establishment of a man-made religion. The Bible records God’s initiative to reconcile creation to Himself, while Islam—despite its claims—presents a framework fundamentally at odds with the revealed character of God. This article explores why Christianity, and not Islam, is consistent with the essence and self-disclosure of the Almighty God.I. God’s Essence: Relationship, Not ReligionA. God’s Desire for RelationshipFrom the opening chapters of Genesis, the Bible reveals that God’s primary intention is relational, not ritualistic or religious. Adam and Eve walked with God in the garden (Genesis 3:8), symbolizing intimacy, trust, and direct communion. Even after the Fall, God pursued humanity through covenants and prophetic revelation, culminating in the Incarnation—God becoming flesh in Jesus Christ (John 1:14).Genesis 3:8: “And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day…”Jeremiah 31:33: “…I will be their God, and they shall be my people.”John 17:3: “Now this is eternal life: that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.”B. Religion as Human ConstructContrary to biblical revelation, religion is often the human attempt to reach God through rituals, laws, and systems. The New Testament asserts that it is not through works or religion, but through grace and faith in Christ that reconciliation is achieved (Ephesians 2:8-9).Colossians 2:20-23criticizes “self-imposed religion” and ritualistic observances that lack spiritual power.II. Christianity: The Divine Initiative of ReconciliationChristianity is rooted in God’s self-revelation and initiative. The Torah and the Gospel are unique in that their authenticity was confirmed by God’s own voice from heaven.A. Divine Approval of the Torah and GospelExodus 19:9: “And the LORD said to Moses, ‘Behold, I am coming to you in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you…’”Matthew 17:5: “A voice from the cloud said, ‘This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him!’”These instances show direct divine endorsement—God publicly and audibly affirms the message and messenger. Nowhere in the Quranic tradition is there a parallel event where Allah audibly endorses Muhammad in front of witnesses.B. Reconciliation as the Heart of the Gospel2 Corinthians 5:18-19: “All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation…”Christianity is a message of restoration, forgiveness, and peace with God. The work of Christ is redemptive and reconciling, establishing a relationship—not a religion—between God and man.III. Islam: A Theological and Historical CritiqueA. The Quran’s Content and OrientationUnlike the Bible’s narrative of reconciliation, the Quran repeatedly emphasizes struggle, conflict, and legalistic submission.Quran 9:29: “Fight those who do not believe in Allah…”Quran 8:12: “I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them.”While the Bible calls believers to love even their enemies (Matthew 5:44), the Quran’s primary orientation in many passages is towards conflict and subjugation, not reconciliation.B. Absence of Divine EndorsementNowhere in the Quran or Hadiths does Allah speak audibly to Muhammad in the presence of others, nor does he publicly endorse Muhammad as his messenger, in contrast to the biblical pattern.Quran 42:51: “It is not for any mortal that Allah should speak to him except by revelation or from behind a veil…”The relationship between Allah and Muhammad is one of distance and mediation through the angel Jibril, whereas the biblical God speaks directly and openly to His chosen servants.C. Islam’s Borrowed Narratives and Theological DiscontinuityHistorical and textual criticism shows that much of the Quran’s content borrows from pre-existing Judeo-Christian and apocryphal sources, often with significant alterations and theological distortions (see W. Montgomery Watt, “Muhammad at Mecca”, and Sidney Griffith, “The Bible in Arabic”).Sura 5:46: “And We sent, following in their footsteps, Jesus, the son of Mary, confirming that which came before him in the Torah; and We gave him the Gospel…”Yet, the Quran simultaneously denies key doctrines of the Gospel (e.g., Jesus’ divinity and crucifixion), placing it in theological conflict with its supposed source.IV. Satan, War, and ReconciliationA. The Spirit of Reconciliation vs. WarThe Bible identifies Satan as the originator of conflict, chaos, and destruction (John 8:44; Revelation 12:9). Whenever a religious system is marked by perpetual conflict and absence of true reconciliation, it departs from the spirit and essence of the biblical God.James 3:17-18: “But the wisdom from above is…peaceable, gentle…And a harvest of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.”B. The Fruit of Each MessageChristianity’s message produces reconciliation, love, and peace—signs of God’s kingdom. Islam, in its earliest expansions and in much of its doctrine, produces conquest, division, and religious striving.V. Conclusion: Christianity Alone Aligns with God’s EssenceIn summary, theological and historical evidence demonstrates that Christianity—not Islam—is aligned with the essence, revelation, and intent of Almighty God. Christianity stands upon the public, divine approval of God (Exodus 19:9; Matthew 17:5) and fulfills God’s purpose for relationship and reconciliation, not mere religion.Islam, on the other hand, offers a system of human striving, lacking the audible and public affirmation of God, and diverging from the message of reconciliation. Its historical borrowing, theological contradictions, and spirit of conflict further distance it from the revealed nature of the Almighty God.ReferencesThe Holy Bible, NIVThe QuranW.

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThe doctrine of Christ’s divinity stands as the cornerstone of Christian theology. One of the most profound attributes of divinity, acknowledged across the Abrahamic faiths, is the power of creation. In this scholarly article, I examine both the Quranic and Biblical attestations to Jesus’ creative power, revealing how the unique ascription of creative authority to Jesus in both scriptures is a compelling testament to His divine identity.Allah's Question in the Quran: The Creator vs. the Non-CreatorThe Quran itself raises a profound rhetorical question concerning the distinction between the Creator and those who do not create:Quran 16:17:\"Is then He Who creates like one who does not create? Will you not then take heed?\"Here, Allah challenges the reader: Is it possible to equate the Creator with the created? The Qur'anic context makes clear that the power to create is a defining attribute of God, an exclusive prerogative that distinguishes the Divine from all creatures.Jesus’ Creative Acts in the QuranThe Quran attributes creative acts to Isa (Jesus) that mirror those ascribed to God in the Old Testament:Quran 3:49:\"And [Isa, Jesus] will be a messenger to the Children of Israel, [who will say]: 'Indeed, I have come to you with a sign from your Lord: I will create for you out of clay the likeness of a bird, then I will breathe into it and it will become a bird by Allah’s permission. I heal those born blind and the lepers, and I give life to the dead by Allah’s permission…'\"This passage outlines a series of miracles performed by Jesus:Creating a living bird from clay by breathing into it,Healing the blind and lepers,Raising the dead.It is significant to note that the act of forming a living creature from clay, then imparting life by breath, directly echoes the Genesis creation narrative:Genesis 2:7:\"Then the LORD God formed man of dust from the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being.\"Thus, both the Bible and the Quran attribute the creative act—especially breathing life into clay—as the unique prerogative of God, now performed by Jesus.The Meaning of \"By Allah’s Permission\"Muslim apologists often argue that the phrase \"by Allah’s permission\" (bi-idhni Allah) demotes Jesus to the status of a mere servant or prophet. However, theologically, the concept of \"permission\" or \"authority\" does not negate inherent power. In Johannine theology, Jesus Himself emphasizes a similar relational dynamic:John 5:30:\"I can do nothing on my own. As I hear, I judge…\"Here, Jesus expresses voluntary submission to the Father, not lack of divine power. The self-humbling of Christ—kenosis(Philippians 2:6-8)—demonstrates His willingness to operate within the limitations of human flesh, without divesting Himself of His divine essence. Likewise, Jesus’ miracles, performed \"by permission,\" reflect His incarnational humility rather than an absence of deity.The Pre-Existence and Divine Authority of JesusJohn's Gospel explicitly asserts the divine creative role of the Logos (the Word), identified with Jesus:John 1:1-3:\"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. Through Him all things were made; without Him nothing was made that has been made.\"This passage leaves no doubt that Jesus is the Agent of creation, co-equal and consubstantial with God the Father. This creative power is not borrowed, but intrinsic.The Quranic Dilemma: Creator vs. Non-CreatorReturning to the Quranic principle:Quran 16:17:\"Is then He Who creates like one who does not create?\"The Quranic argument is unequivocal: Only God creates. Therefore, if Jesus creates, as the Quran itself testifies, He partakes in the divine essence and prerogative. The Quran, in attempting to honor Jesus as a prophet, inadvertently confesses His divine creative power—an attribute exclusive to God alone.Conclusion: Jesus as the Divine CreatorBoth the Bible and the Quran, when read without apologetic prejudice, bear witness to the divine creative power of Jesus. The Quran’s testimony that Jesus creates life from clay and imparts the breath of life mirrors the Genesis account of God’s unique creative act. The New Testament reveals this same Jesus as the eternal Word through whom all things were made. No mere prophet, angel, or creature can claim the power to create ex nihilo or impart life—such power belongs to God alone.Therefore, the only consistent theological conclusion, based on the evidence from both scriptures, is that Jesus is God the Creator, worthy of worship and honor.By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteReferencesThe Holy Bible, Genesis 2:7; John 1:1-3; John 5:30; Philippians 2:6-8The Quran, Surah 3:49; 15:28; 16:17; 22:5This article is freely distributable in its original form.

This attribute, Al-Warith, is one of the 99 Names of Allah in the Quran.Does Jesus have this attribute of beingTHE INHERITOR OF ALL THINGS, “Al-Warith”? Let us first read the Quran and see if Allah possesses this attribute of Al-Warith.Surah Maryam 19:40:“So beware! Know that surely Allah is the inheritor of the entire world and everything in it, and their account is with Allah.”Allah says that He is the inheritor of all things in the Quran, which was written in the year 632 AD after Jesus. This means that Jesus was actually the first to declare these words, that He is the inheritor of all things, according to the evidence of the Bible, which came before the Quran.Let us now see if Jesus truly has this attribute of beingTHE INHERITOR OF ALL THINGS, which is the majesty of God alone according to the Quran, written 632 years after Jesus.The Holy Bible says the following about Jesus Christ:Hebrews 1:2:“But in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom he made the universe.”In this verse, we read that Jesus is called“HEIR OF ALL THINGS,”which is the majesty/attribute of Almighty God as also testified in the Quran, Surah 19:40. Therefore, Allah and the Quran have acknowledged that Jesus is God because the Bible, which preceded the Quran by 632 years, has confirmed that Jesus is the heir of all things—and this evidence is found in the Book of Hebrews 1:2.Dear friends, this is enough evidence to prove that Jesus is God, because today we have learned that Jesus was called and claimed to beTHE INHERITOR OF ALL THINGS632 years before the Quran was written. Now, between the Bible that came before the Quran and the Quran that came after the Bible, which book will you follow? Researchers in various fields always use the earliest data to authenticate matters. And the earliest data we have about the “Inheritor of All Things” is found in the Bible and says thatTHE INHERITOR OF ALL THINGS IS JESUS.There is no debate here about the inheritance of all things, which belongs to Jesus. For He is the Son of God and was confirmed as the heir of all things 632 years before the Quran.Today I have answered the question of Muslims: “Is Jesus God?” The Quran and Allah themselves say that Jesus is God because Jesus possesses all the majesty and/or attributes of God—and one of these attributes isAL-WARITH.In His service,Dr. Maxwell ShimbaCopyright © Max Shimba Ministries 2015",

    "full_content": "\"THE ROYAL WE\" OR \"PLURALITY OF RESPECT\" DEBUNKED:A Theological and Linguistic Critique of Plural Pronouns for Allah in the QuranBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis article critically examines the widespread Islamic defense of plural pronouns—\"We,\" \"Us,\" \"Our\"—used for Allah in the Quran. While Muslim scholars claim this represents the \"Royal We\" or \"Plurality of Respect,\" this justification faces significant theological and linguistic problems, especially when considering Quran 21:17 and the consistent Islamic insistence on divine simplicity and oneness (tawhid). Moreover, the phenomenon is analyzed within the context of the Quran's roots and compared to the biblical use of the plural \"Elohim.\" This article challenges the coherence and legitimacy of the \"Royal We\" claim, exposing its weaknesses and historical complications.IntroductionA recurring apologetic in Islamic theology asserts that when Allah says\"We,\" \"Us,\" or \"Our\"in the Quran, He is not referencing a plurality of beings, but instead employing a \"majestic plural,\" commonly called the\"Royal We.\"This explanation is routinely given whenever critics point to passages where Allah appears to speak as more than one (e.g., Quran 2:34, 21:17, 15:9).But if Allah is absolutely one—a singular entity with no partners or plurality—why does he consistently refer to himself in the plural? Does this align with Islamic claims about God's transcendence and uniqueness? Or does it expose an underlying syncretism or theological borrowing, possibly from the polytheistic backgrounds prevalent in pre-Islamic Arabia? And if Allah cannot be likened to humans (Quran 42:11), why borrow a distinctlyhuman, royal conventionto describe divine speech? This article will dissect these questions.Section 1: The \"Royal We\" in Language—A Human, Not Divine, ConventionThe \"Royal We\" or \"Plurality of Respect\" is well-known in certain human cultures, where monarchs and officials use plural pronouns to emphasize their status. In English, for example, Queen Victoria's \"We are not amused\" illustrates this convention. The use of such language isrooted in human social structures—hierarchies, courts, and collective leadership.Key Point:Nowhere in the Quran does Allah explain that His use of the plural is simply \"majestic.\"The Quran asserts, \"There is nothing like unto Him\" (Quran 42:11); Allah should not use human royal conventions to express Himself if He truly transcends all creation.Contrast:The God of the Bible—the term \"Elohim\" is a plural noun but is often used with singular verbs, and is consistently interpreted in Judeo-Christian theology as signifying majesty, fullness, or even a hint at plurality within unity (as in the Christian doctrine of the Trinity).In the Bible, there are moments (\"Let us make man in our image,\" Genesis 1:26) where the context supports this plural as meaningful.Section 2: The Qur'anic Plural—Confusion and ContradictionLet us look at specific Quranic texts. Allah often says \"We sent down,\" \"We created,\" or \"Our angels.\" However, in other places, Allah switches to \"I\"—for example, Quran 20:14: \"Indeed, I am Allah. There is no deity except Me, so worship Me…\"The Problem:If Allah is not plural, then why the switch? If the plural is \"majestic,\" why not use \"I\" throughout, to avoid theological confusion? The shift appears arbitrary and undermines the Quran’s own claim of clarity (Quran 12:1, 16:89).Quran 21:17 – The Test Case\"Had We intended to take a diversion, We could have taken it from [what is] with Us—if indeed We were to do so.\" (Quran 21:17, Sahih International)If \"We\" refers only to Allah, does it mean Allah is proposing to take Himself as a consort? Does this fit the Islamic concept of God's transcendence?If Muslims insist that \"We\" is a singular God, the verse becomes grammatically and theologically awkward—who is the potential partner? If \"We\" means more than one, it contradicts tawhid.Logical Impasse:Either the Quran is needlessly confusing in its language about God, or the plurality reflects an awkward attempt to cover over more ancient, pluralistic origins.Section 3: Allah, Plurality, and Pagan RootsThe historical origins of Allah as a deity must also be considered. Pre-Islamic Arabia was rife with polytheism; the Kaaba itself once housed360 idols. Scholarly research, including the works of Arthur Jeffery and Patricia Crone, indicates that \"Allah\" was originally regarded as the chief of a pantheon of gods.Argument:The plural pronouns (\"We,\" \"Us\") may reflect an amalgamation of various deities into one supreme figure, resulting in lingering linguistic plurality.Thus, Allah’s use of plural pronouns may not be \"majestic,\" but a vestige of his composite, pagan origins.Quranic Evidence:The Quran repeatedly condemns \"associating partners\" with Allah (shirk), yet the grammar of the Quran itself seems to betray an underlying plurality.Section 4: Elohim vs. Allah—A Theological DistinctionThe God of the Bible, as revealed in the Old Testament, uses the plural nounElohim, and the context (especially in Christian theology) sometimes supports a complex unity—fulfilled in the New Testament understanding of the Trinity. Thus, when God says \"Let Us make man,\" the context supports either a majestic plural or intra-divine conversation.By contrast, Islamic theologystrictly deniesany division, multiplicity, or partnership in the Godhead—Allah is asingle, undifferentiated entity. This makes the repeated use of plural pronouns not only confusing but theologically incoherent.Section 5: Conclusion—A Call for Consistency and ClarityIf Allah is truly one, eternal, indivisible, and beyond all human convention, then the persistent use of plural pronouns is inexplicable, misleading, and inconsistent with both the Quran’s own statements and Islamic doctrine.The use of \"We,\" \"Us,\" and \"Our\" is not only linguistically unnecessary, but also historically suspicious and theologically problematic.The explanation of the \"Royal We\" is a weak apologetic, especially given Islam’s strict prohibitions against likening God to human beings.In Summary:If Allah is absolutely one, he should express himself as \"I\"—a simple, clear, and unambiguous singular pronoun.The presence of plural language betrays either a confused borrowing from human tradition or, more troublingly, a holdover from earlier, pluralistic religious conceptions.The \"Royal We\" fails as a defense; it is a human linguistic device, not a divine one.Challenge:Muslim theologians are invited to provide a more consistent and theologically sound explanation, or else admit the profound ambiguity and historical borrowing inherent in their scriptures.Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteFor critical and academic engagement, contact:info@shimbatheology.eduReferences:Quran, various translationsGenesis 1:26, Hebrew BibleArthur Jeffery,The Foreign Vocabulary of the Qur'anPatricia Crone,Meccan Trade and the Rise of IslamStandard Islamic tafsirs on Quran 21:17",

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteA recurring challenge presented by Muslim interlocutors is the claim that Jesus never explicitly stated, \"I am God,\" and thus cannot be considered divine. This assertion is frequently encountered in interreligious dialogues, with critics insisting upon a direct statement from Jesus Himself, articulated in unequivocal terms. However, a close exegesis of the Christian Scriptures reveals that not only is the divinity of Christ affirmed throughout the New Testament, but there are passages in which Jesus, with His own mouth, confesses His identity as God.One of the most striking instances is found in the Book of Revelation, a text acknowledged in mainstream Christian canon and attributed to the apostle John. InRevelation 21:6–7, the speaker—Jesus Christ Himself—makes a direct and unambiguous declaration regarding His divine identity:\"He said to me: 'It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. To the thirsty I will give water without cost from the spring of the water of life. Those who are victorious will inherit all this, and I will be their God and they will be my children.'\"(Revelation 21:6–7, NIV)This passage is critically important for several reasons:1.Self-Identification as GodJesus proclaims, \"I will be their God, and they will be my children.\" The phrase is unambiguous. Here, the speaker is not merely affirming a prophetic or messianic role, but appropriates the very language that, throughout the Old Testament, is reserved for God alone (cf. Jeremiah 31:33, Ezekiel 37:27). By declaring Himself both \"the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End,\" Jesus invokes titles that in Jewish monotheism can only belong to YHWH, the one true God (cf. Isaiah 44:6, Isaiah 48:12).2.Direct Speech to JohnIt is essential to note that this statement is presented as a direct utterance from Christ to the apostle John—removing any ambiguity about the source. The passage is not a theological reflection by a later writer, but rather, is depicted as the very words of Jesus Himself, thus meeting the demand for explicit self-disclosure.3.Consistent Biblical WitnessThis confession aligns with numerous other New Testament testimonies to Jesus’ divinity. For example:In John 1:1–3, Jesus is identified as the pre-existent Word whowasGod.In John 20:28, Thomas confesses Jesus as \"My Lord and my God,\" which Jesus does not rebuke.In John 10:30, Jesus states, \"I and the Father are one,\" eliciting an attempted stoning for blasphemy by His Jewish hearers.4.Implications for Salvation and WorshipJesus' confession in Revelation 21:6–7 also addresses the soteriological implications of His divinity: \"To the thirsty I will give water without cost from the spring of the water of life.\" This echoes the unique, divine prerogative of giving eternal life—something ascribed to God alone throughout the Hebrew Scriptures (cf. Jeremiah 2:13).5.Theological and Apologetic ConsequenceThe explicit confession, \"I will be their God,\" stands as a direct response to Muslim objections. The claim that Jesus never identified Himself as God is not tenable in light of this text. Christian theology does not rest on a single verse, but Revelation 21:6–7 provides a direct and unambiguous affirmation of Christ’s divinity, spoken by Christ Himself.ConclusionTherefore, in light of the foregoing exegetical and theological analysis, it is evident that Jesus not only accepted divine titles and worship, but also explicitly confessed with His own mouth that He is God.The challenge now is not for Christians to prove what the Scriptures plainly declare, but for the reader to respond to this divine revelation. Jesus is the only way to eternal life (John 14:6); religions and human works cannot save, but Christ, who confesses Himself to be God, invites all to partake in the life that He alone can give.Accept Christ today and receive eternal life.For further inquiries and theological resources:Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteMax Shimba Ministries Org, 2014References:Holy Bible, New International Version.Brown, R.

    "full_content": "A Theological Challenge to the Islamic Conception of GodBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThe term “Father” as used by Jesus in reference to God stands at the heart of the Christian revelation and is foundational to Christian theology. Conversely, Allah in Islam categorically denies any notion of divine Fatherhood, explicitly repudiating the concept in the Qur’an. This paper explores the profound theological and historical discontinuities between the Christian God, who is revealed as Father in the ministry of Jesus, and Allah of the Islamic tradition. We address the central question:If Allah is the same God as the God of Jesus, why did He never reveal Himself as Father, and why did He wait centuries to correct this supposed error?1. The Fatherhood of God in the Teachings of JesusThe New Testament is saturated with references to God as “Father.” Jesus employs this intimate language over 170 times in the Gospels, not only in private prayers (Mark 14:36; John 17:1,11) but also in teaching the disciples to pray: “Our Father in heaven…” (Matthew 6:9). This Fatherhood is not merely metaphorical or functional, but ontological—expressing an essential relational dynamic within the Godhead (John 1:18; John 5:18; John 10:30).Moreover, the earliest Christian creeds and the apostolic witness unanimously affirm that God is eternally Father to the Son (Nicene Creed, c. 325 AD; cf. John 17:24).Scriptural Evidence:Matthew 11:27:“No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son…”John 5:18:The Jews tried to kill Jesus “because he was… calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God.”John 20:17:“I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.”This consistent, public, and unchallenged use of “Father” by Jesus is unparalleled in pre-Christian Jewish literature, highlighting its revelatory significance.2. The Silence and Absence of Allah in the GospelsIf, as Islamic polemic claims, Allah is the same God whom Jesus worshipped and revealed, we are compelled to ask:Where was Allah when Jesus called God “Father”?There are several options, none of which are satisfactory for Islamic theology:a)Allah was Silent or AbsentIf Allah is the God of the Gospel, why did He not correct Jesus—or the disciples, or the early Church—regarding the “error” of calling God “Father”?The Quran repeatedly insists, “It is not befitting to Allah that He should beget a son” (Quran 19:35; 112:3). Yet, for nearly 600 years, no divine correction is issued until Muhammad arises in 7th-century Arabia. Such divine silence is incongruent with the vigilance and corrective zeal Allah displays elsewhere in Islamic scripture.b)Allah is not the God whom Jesus RevealedA more logical conclusion is that the God revealed by Jesus—the God who calls Himself Father—is categorically distinct from Allah of the Quran. The Johannine and Synoptic traditions make clear that the Fatherhood of God is central, not peripheral, to Christ’s revelation.c)The Law of First Proclamation and Doctrinal ConsistencyIn biblical theology, the principle of “first proclamation” or “progressive revelation” holds that God’s self-revelation is consistent and unchanging (Malachi 3:6; James 1:17). The God of the Bible reveals Himself progressively, but never contradicts prior revelation. If Allah were truly the God of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Jesus, He could not introduce a doctrinal innovation that flatly contradicts the cornerstone of Christ’s message.3. The Qur’anic Rejection of Divine FatherhoodThe Qur’an not only avoids “Father” language, but outright rejects it:Quran 5:18:“The Jews and Christians say, ‘We are the children of Allah and His loved ones.’ Say, ‘Why then does He punish you for your sins?’”Quran 19:88-92:“And they say, ‘The Most Merciful has taken [for Himself] a son.’ You have done an atrocious thing…”Quran 112:3:“He neither begets nor is born.”This is not a matter of differing terminology but a fundamental theological chasm. Nowhere in the Qur’an does Allah ever reveal himself as Father. Islamic exegesis (tafsir) is unanimous: “Father” as a title for God is shirk (blasphemous association).4. Historical and Theological DiscontinuityIf Allah is the same God as the Father of Jesus, the absence of divine correction during the ministry of Jesus, the apostolic age, and the patristic period is inexplicable.Why did Allah wait over six centuries to send Muhammad to “correct” Jesus’ supposed error?Such a view not only indicts God’s providence and sovereignty but undermines the credibility of both Christian and Islamic scripture.Furthermore, if Allah is not the Father, then he cannot be the God of Jesus. The central Christian confession—that God is Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (Matthew 28:19)—excludes any deity who does not eternally exist as Father.5. Academic Consensus and Scholarly ReflectionsLarry Hurtado (Lord Jesus Christ: Devotion to Jesus in Earliest Christianity):The worship of Jesus as Son of the Father is the earliest and most distinctive mark of Christian faith, distinguishing it sharply from Judaism and, later, Islam.Richard Bauckham (Jesus and the God of Israel):The early church’s invocation of God as Father “rests on the direct teaching and example of Jesus.”Kenneth Cragg (The Call of the Minaret):“The Qur’an’s rejection of the divine Fatherhood stands as its most decisive break with Christian revelation.”6. Conclusion: Allah—A Different GodThe law of first proclamation, the consistency of divine revelation, and the unbroken testimony of the church require that the true God is the one revealed by Jesus as Father.The absence of any correction by Allah during the Gospel era, and the outright rejection of divine Fatherhood centuries later, strongly indicates that Allah is not the God of Jesus, but a later theological construct—one that came, not to fulfill, but to contradict the self-revelation of the God of the Bible.In sum:If Allah were God, He would have affirmed or corrected Jesus during his earthly ministry regarding calling God “Father.” The 600-year silence is theologically indefensible. Allah’s refusal to be “Father” is a categorical proof that he is not the God and Father of Jesus Christ.The God of Jesus is the Father—eternally, unchangeably, and uniquely so.To deny the Fatherhood of God is to deny the heart of Christian revelation.ReferencesThe Holy Bible (Matthew, John, Revelation, Malachi, James)The Holy Qur’an (Surahs 5, 19, 112)Larry Hurtado,Lord Jesus ChristRichard Bauckham,Jesus and the God of IsraelKenneth Cragg,The Call of the MinaretN.

Let us read:Galatians 1:1\"Paul, an apostle—sent not from men nor by a man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead.\"This verse is crystal clear:Paul was commissioned directly by God, not by any human or intermediary angel.Now, contrast this with Muhammad: the Qur'an openly declares that Muhammad received his message throughJibril (Gabriel), who is not God. According to Islamic sources, Muhammad never spoke to or saw God directly, but always through this angelic intermediary.In stark contrast, Scripture teaches that Paul’s apostleship came directly fromGod Himself.Romans 1:1\"Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle and set apart for the gospel of God.\"Therefore, from today onward, it must be understood clearly:Muslims are following a counterfeit message.Muhammad never spoke with God. Muhammad was not sent by God. He was afalse prophetwithout divine commission.All true prophets and apostles in the Bible conversed directly with God—without the need for an intermediary angel.Yet Muhammad relied entirely on Jibril, an angelic being allegedly sent by Allah.Why is Muhammad the only so-called prophet who needed an intermediary in his communications with his god?If Allah were truly the Almighty God, why would He need an intermediary to communicate with Muhammad? Why did the God of the Bible never require such intermediaries when speaking to His prophets?If you, Muslims,cannot produce a single verse from the Qur'an or the Bible stating that Paul was not an apostle of God, then your silence itself becomes undeniable evidence that Muhammad was afalse prophet, while Paul was indeed atrue apostle of the Living God.Additional Theological Questions for ReflectionIf Paul was not a true apostle, why did the early Church—both Jews and Gentiles—accept his writings as inspired Scripture?Why do even Islamic commentators admit that Paul’s influence on the early Christian Church was profound, while the Qur’an never explicitly denounces him?Why does the Qur’an mention other figures—like Jesus and Mary—but never directly mention Paul if he were so supposedly false? Would not a true \"final revelation\" warn against him?How can Muhammad’s supposed prophetic status be valid when no biblical prophet nor the New Testament apostles ever prophesied about Muhammad?Why do the biblical apostles (including Paul) show consistency with the Old Testament revelation of God, while Muhammad introduces doctrines contradictory to both Old and New Testaments?Why did Jesus never mention Muhammad, even though He foretold the coming of the Holy Spirit? Why does Paul confirm this teaching, while Muhammad contradicts it?Final ChallengeMuslims, produce your evidence!Bring us a verse from theQur’anor theBiblethat says:\"Paul was not an Apostle of God.\"Until then, your failure to do so is proof that Paul’s apostleship stands firm, and Muhammad’s prophethood remains unsubstantiated.The question remains:Why does the God of the Bible speakdirectlyto His chosen servants, while the Allah of Islam cannot?",

If you carefully examine the following verse, you will see that Jesus created, which is a unique attribute of God alone. Jesus raised the dead and healed the sick. However, nowhere do we read that Muhammad performed such miracles. Let us read from the Quran:Quran 5:110“When Allah will say: O Jesus, son of Mary! Remember My favor upon you and upon your mother when I supported you with the Holy Spirit. You spoke to the people in the cradle and in maturity; and [remember] when I taught you writing and wisdom and the Torah and the Gospel; and when you made out of clay the shape of a bird by My permission, then you breathed into it and it became a bird by My permission; and you healed the blind and the leper by My permission; and when you brought forth the dead by My permission; and when I restrained the Children of Israel from you when you came to them with clear proofs, but those who disbelieved among them said, ‘This is nothing but obvious magic.’”Dear brethren, today we have learned that Jesus was not an ordinary man. He performed deeds that only God Himself is able to do. This evidence is clearly found in the Quran. The claim that Jesus was just a Prophet like the others collapses after reading this verse, which reveals the divine glory manifested in Jesus. Has there ever been any Prophet or Messenger who created?Let us also examine the following Hadith from Al-Bukhari:Ibn 'Abbas said, “That indicated the death of the Messenger of Allah which Allah had informed (him of).” 'Umar said, “I do not understand it except as you understand it.” Aisha said: During his illness, which ultimately led to his death, the Prophet kept saying, “O Aisha, I still feel the pain caused by the food I ate at Khaibar, and at this time, I feel as if my aorta is being cut from that poison.”(Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 5, Book 59, Number 713)From this Hadith, we observe that the Prophet of Allah was afflicted by poison administered by a Jewish woman. This Hadith gives us clear evidence that the Prophet of Allah was praying for healing from Allah. The critical question here is: What happened to Muhammad after these prayers to Allah?Let us read further:In the following Hadith, we read that even Gabriel came to pray for the health of the Prophet, yet these prayers did not result in Muhammad’s healing.From Ibn Sad, page 265:The Prophet of Allah became ill and Gabriel prayed for him, saying, “In the name of Allah, I pray for your health and seek to protect you from all evil, from every envious one, and from all harm, and Allah will heal you.”Did the Prophet of Allah recover after these prayers? According to our first Hadith, the Prophet did not recover despite prayers from the Angel Gabriel. Yet in the Quran, we read that Jesus had the power to heal, raise the dead, and create—abilities neither Gabriel nor the Prophet Muhammad possessed.Dear brethren,Why follow a Prophet who lacked the power to heal?Why listen to an angel who could not heal, even though he was sent by Allah?Why would Allah send Gabriel to pray for Muhammad, knowing full well that Muhammad would not recover?These are a few questions you should consider. Is Allah truly God? If He is God, why did He fail to heal His own Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)?The Bible says the following in the Gospel of Mark:Mark 16:17-18“And these signs will accompany those who believe: In My name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up serpents with their hands; and if they drink any deadly thing, it will not harm them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover.”Christians have been given authority to pray for the sick in the Name of Jesus—something which does not exist in Islam. The Bible declares that, in the Name of Jesus, we cast out demons, heal the sick, raise the dead, and perform many wonders. Jesus gave us His Name, which is above every name—the only Name that can cast out demons, heal, resurrect, and perform mighty works. Jesus was not just a prophet or ordinary man. His deeds are continually manifested through His followers.I urge you to accept Jesus, who had the power to raise the dead, heal the sick, and create. These statements are confirmed in the Quran, and the Bible affirms them as well.If Allah is truly God, why did he send Gabriel to pray for Muhammad when he knew that Muhammad would die?May God richly bless you,In His Service,Dr. Maxwell ShimbaFor Max Shimba MinistriesCopyright © Max Shimba Ministries 2013",

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionA recurring objection among Muslim apologists is that the Bible, according to their selective citations, allegedly denies the divinity of Jesus Christ. As evidenced in the image above, verses are isolated from their literary, historical, and theological context to argue that Jesus is not God. Such arguments are not only theologically shallow but demonstrate a fundamental misunderstanding of the Christian doctrine of the Trinity and Christology as revealed in both the Old and New Testaments.This article provides a scholarly refutation of these claims and affirms the biblical and theological foundation of the divinity of Jesus Christ.1.Jesus’ Relationship with the Father Does Not Deny His DivinityThe argument that Jesus calling the Father \"the only true God\" (John 17:3) or referring to \"my God and your God\" (John 20:17) somehow denies His divinity is based on a misunderstanding of Trinitarian theology. In Christian doctrine, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are three distinct Persons, yet one in essence (homoousios).When Jesus speaks of the Father as God, He does so in accordance with His incarnate role as the Son who has humbled Himself (Philippians 2:6-8). The distinction of Persons does not imply a denial of essence or divinity. In fact, Jesus’ frequent references to God as His Father (e.g., John 5:18; 10:30) were understood by His Jewish contemporaries as a claim to equality with God:\"For this reason they tried all the more to kill him; not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father,making himself equal with God.\" (John 5:18, NIV)Key Point:Allah never called himself Fatherin the Quran. Jesus’ unique address of God as Father is not just relational; it is ontological, signifying His participation in the very being of God.2.Jesus’ Humility Does Not Contradict His DeityVerses such as \"the Father is greater than I\" (John 14:28) and \"I can do nothing by myself\" (John 5:30) reflect the doctrine of thekenosis—the self-emptying of the Son (Philippians 2:6-7). In His incarnation, Jesus voluntarily accepted the limitations of humanity without ceasing to be God. Early Church Fathers, from Athanasius to Augustine, consistently taught that Jesus’ subordination in function (not essence) was due to His incarnate mission.Key Point:Functional subordination in the economy of salvation is not ontological subordination.Jesus, as the God-Man, acts in perfect unity with the Father (John 10:30, “I and the Father are one”).3.Jesus’ Omniscience and Omnipotence in the Context of the IncarnationCiting Mark 13:32 (\"no one knows... not even the Son\") as proof against Jesus’ divinity ignores the theological nuance of the incarnation. As the eternal Logos, Jesus possesses all divine attributes (Colossians 2:9), but as the incarnate Son, He sometimes chose not to exercise His divine prerogatives (see also Luke 2:52).Gregory Nazianzus observed: “As man He was baptized, but He absolved sins as God... He is carried up to the temple as an infant, and He is worshiped there as God.”4.Jesus Worshipped and Prayed as the Incarnate SonJesus’ prayer (Matthew 26:39; Luke 6:12) is a necessary feature of His genuine humanity and His role as the perfect mediator (1 Timothy 2:5). Far from denying His divinity, His prayer life reveals His role as the Second Adam who succeeds where the first Adam failed (Romans 5:19).5.Jesus’ “Goodness” and the Claim of DivinityThe passage “Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone” (Mark 10:18) is not a denial of His deity. Rather, Jesus challenges the questioner to reflect on the implications of calling Him “good”—a divine attribute. If the questioner truly understood Jesus’ identity, he would recognize that Jesus is indeed “good” because He is God (see John 10:11, “I am the Good Shepherd”).6.Authority and the GiverMatthew 28:18 states that “all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.” This is not a denial of Christ’s divinity, but a proclamation of His exaltation post-resurrection (Philippians 2:9-11). The eternal Son, in union with the Father and Spirit, has all authority intrinsically; as the God-Man, He receives authority as the last Adam and universal Lord.7.Jesus as Prophet, Servant, and ManActs 2:22 and 1 Timothy 2:5 affirm the true humanity of Jesus. Orthodox Christian doctrine holds that Jesus is fully Godandfully man (the hypostatic union, John 1:14). To call Him a prophet or servant does not deny His divinity, but acknowledges the mystery of the incarnation.8.The Death of Christ and Divine ImmortalityThe objection “Jesus died — but God is immortal” is answered by the doctrine of the two natures of Christ. The divine nature did not die, but the human nature suffered death; this is the core of Christian soteriology (see Hebrews 2:9-14).9.Jesus’ Direct Claims to DeityMuslim apologists ignore or distort the many direct and indirect claims to deity by Jesus:John 8:58:“Before Abraham was, I AM.” (cf. Exodus 3:14)John 10:30:“I and the Father are one.”John 20:28:Thomas declares, “My Lord and my God!” and Jesus accepts the title.Revelation 1:17-18; 22:13:Jesus identifies Himself as the Alpha and Omega—the eternal God.Early Church Evidence:The earliest Christian hymns and prayers (Philippians 2:5-11; Colossians 1:15-20) ascribe worship and divine titles to Jesus. The apostolic witness is unequivocal:“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God... And the Word became flesh.” (John 1:1, 14)ConclusionThe argument that “according to the Bible, Jesus is not God” is a misrepresentation born from reading the text without reference to context, doctrine, or the totality of biblical revelation. Nowhere does Jesus deny His divinity; rather, He affirms it consistently, both in word and deed. The Christian confession that “Jesus is Lord” (Romans 10:9; Philippians 2:11) remains the foundation of Christian faith and is irrefutable from the biblical text.In contrast, the Quran never refers to Allah as “Father,” nor does it capture the intimate, ontological relationship between the Father and the Son as revealed by Jesus Christ. This unique revelation is at the heart of the Christian gospel.ReferencesBauckham, Richard.Jesus and the God of IsraelWright, N.T.Jesus and the Victory of GodKelly, J.N.D.Early Christian DoctrinesThe Nicene Creed (325 AD)The Bible: John 1:1-14; John 5:18; John 8:58; John 10:30-38; Philippians 2:5-11; Colossians 2:9; Hebrews 1:3-8; Revelation 1:8, 17-18; 22:13By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteOpening StatementIslamic tradition, as preserved in various hadith collections, raises significant questions about the theological standing and spiritual agency of women in Islam. One such hadith, found inSunan Ibn Majah950, asserts:\"Muhammad said the prayer is annulled by the passing of a dog, a donkey, or a woman.\"This statement not only equates a woman’s presence with animals considered impure in Islamic law but also implies that her very presence can invalidate a man’s communication with Allah. This foundational assumption brings forth deep theological dilemmas regarding the spiritual equality and ultimate fate of Muslim women. This article, structured as a debate, challenges Muslim scholars and believers to offer coherent answers to the following pressing questions.Point 1: The Contradiction in Worship – Are Women’s Prayers Heard?Challenge:If the mere presence of a woman can annul a man’s prayer, as indicated by the hadith, what does this imply about the efficacy and validity of a woman’s own prayer? Can a woman, whose existence is said to disrupt the worship of men, be assured that her own acts of worship are accepted by Allah? How can Muslim women maintain faith that their prayers will be heard, if the Prophet of Islam declared their presence inherently problematic to the act of prayer?Scholarly Counterpoint:Islamic orthodoxy claims both men and women are obligated to pray, and the Quran commands all believers—male and female—to engage in worship and obedience to Allah (Quran 33:35). However, the hadith presents a contradiction. If a woman can nullify a prayer simply by being present, does her prayer not risk nullification from her own existence or the presence of other women? How does Islamic theology reconcile this inconsistency?Point 2: Islam—A Religion for Men Alone?Challenge:Is Islam, at its core, a religion that centers men and marginalizes women? The testimony of the hadith above, along with many others, seems to relegate women to a spiritual status inferior to men—where her presence, voice, or even body is regarded as a source of fitnah (temptation) or spiritual pollution. Is this the egalitarian vision claimed by many apologists, or does Islam fundamentally prioritize men’s access to the divine?Scholarly Counterpoint:Proponents may argue that Islam honors women and affords them spiritual rights. Yet, the ritual exclusion in mosques, the secondary status in public prayers, and the legal disadvantages in matters of testimony, inheritance, and divorce paint a different picture. How does Islamic tradition justify these practices while claiming to uphold equality before God?Point 3: Promises of the Akhirah—What Awaits Muslim Women?Challenge:According to popular hadith and the broader Islamic eschatological imagination, righteous men in Paradise are promised 72 virgins (houris) as part of their reward (Sunan al-Tirmidhi 2562). But what is the reward for Muslim women in the afterlife? Is there a comparable promise, or does the vision of paradise cater exclusively to male desires? Does the Quran or authentic hadith literature ever promise believing women any concrete, individual reward that parallels what is described for men?Scholarly Counterpoint:Islamic scholars often claim that women will \"be satisfied\" in paradise and receive what their \"hearts desire\" (Quran 41:31). However, the texts are strikingly silent on details or specific promises for women, while being explicit for men. Does this not reveal a patriarchal conception of salvation and bliss, in which women are largely invisible or, at best, accessories to male pleasure?Point 4: The Double Standard of Ritual PurityChallenge:If women annul men’s prayers by their mere passage, does this principle apply in reverse? Can a man’s presence annul a woman’s prayer? If not, what is the theological rationale for this double standard? Does the presence of a man carry intrinsic spiritual purity denied to women? Does this not contradict the claim of universal spiritual equality before Allah?Scholarly Counterpoint:There is no parallel tradition where men’s presence is said to invalidate women’s prayers. This asymmetry points to a theological anthropology in Islam where men are normative and spiritually authoritative, while women are sources of ritual defect and pollution. How can this be reconciled with the Quranic assertion that \"the most honored of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous\" (Quran 49:13), regardless of gender?Conclusion: The Challenge for Muslim ApologistsThe foregoing questions present a profound challenge for Islamic theology:How can Muslim women have confidence in their prayers if their very presence is considered an impediment to men’s prayers?Why does Islamic eschatology privilege men with explicit sensual rewards, while offering women vague promises of satisfaction?What justification is there for the double standard of ritual purity and prayer validity?Call for Response:We call upon Muslim theologians, scholars, and apologists to respond with clear, textually grounded answers. Let them demonstrate, using the Quran and authentic hadith, that Islam provides true spiritual equality for women, both in this life and in the life to come. Until such answers are offered, the questions of spiritual agency, ritual participation, and the destiny of women in Islam remain unresolved and deeply problematic.By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThe intersection between religious revelation and scientific knowledge is a point of continuous discussion within theology, philosophy, and the natural sciences. Islam, through the Quran and Hadith, claims to present ultimate truth regarding human existence, including matters of creation and procreation. However, a critical examination of these sources—specifically, Surah At-Tariq (Quran 86:6-7) and Sahih Muslim 2644—reveals fundamental scientific errors that undermine such claims. This article seeks to provide a scholarly theological analysis alongside a scientific evaluation of these texts, illustrating why the Quran and the teachings of Muhammad lack scientific validity in this domain.Quranic Statement on Human Procreation: Surah At-Tariq 86:6-7“He was created from a fluid, ejected, emerging from between the backbone and the ribs.”— (Quran 86:6-7, Sahih International)Theological ContextClassical and contemporary Islamic commentators have interpreted this passage as describing the origin of human reproductive fluid (sperm). The \"backbone and the ribs\" (min bayni al-sulbi wa al-tara'ib) have been understood by many to refer to anatomical regions of the human body, often taken literally by classical exegesis.Scientific AnalysisModern biology and embryology have thoroughly mapped the processes of human conception:Origin of Sperm:Sperm is produced in the testicles (testes) of the male, which are anatomically located in the scrotum, not between the backbone and ribs.Origin of Ova:The female gamete (egg) is produced in the ovaries, which are also not located between the ribs and the backbone but rather in the pelvic region.Location of Fertilization:Fertilization typically occurs in the fallopian tubes, which are anatomically distant from both the backbone and the ribs.No modern anatomical or physiological source equates the production or ejection of reproductive fluids with the area \"between the backbone and the ribs.\" This is a clear misrepresentation of human biology.Hadith Statement on Sperm in the Womb: Sahih Muslim 2644\"When the drop of (semen) remains in the womb for forty or forty-five nights, the angel comes...\"— (Sahih Muslim 2644)Theological ContextThis hadith claims that after semen remains in the womb for 40 or 45 days, an angel descends to decree the future characteristics of the embryo—its fate, actions, lifespan, and sustenance.Scientific AnalysisModern science provides the following facts:Lifespan of Sperm:Sperm can survive inside the female reproductive tract for a maximum of 5-7 days under optimal conditions. After this, all sperm cells die.Embryological Development:Within 24 hours of fertilization, the sperm cell and egg cell combine to form a zygote, which then begins rapid cell division. By day 40, the embryo has already undergone significant development, including organogenesis (the formation of organs).Implantation:The embryo implants in the uterine wall approximately 6-10 days after fertilization—not after 40 or 45 days.The idea that sperm or a \"drop\" of semen remains unchanged in the womb for 40 or 45 days is unequivocally false according to embryology. No credible scientific source supports this claim.Combined Theological and Scientific Critique1. Theological Inerrancy versus Scientific ErrorIf, as Muslims claim, the Quran and authentic Hadith are the literal words of Allah and the infallible teachings of Muhammad, then scientific errors contained therein are deeply problematic. The infallibility claimed by Islam cannot be reconciled with demonstrable errors in anatomy and embryology.2. Consequences for Islamic Claims of Scientific MiraclesSome modern Islamic apologists attempt to reinterpret such verses metaphorically or claim they \"miraculously\" anticipated modern discoveries. However, the plain language of these passages, as well as classical exegesis, reveals that the original understanding was literal and in line with ancient pre-scientific beliefs.3. Comparison with Modern ScienceQuran:Claims sperm originates from a region between the backbone and ribs—scientifically false.Hadith:Claims sperm remains in the womb for 40/45 days—scientifically false.Science:Demonstrates clear, observable, and repeatable biological processes that contradict the above.Conclusion: Islam and Scientific ReliabilityThe examples analyzed above from both the Quran and Hadith demonstrate a fundamental disconnect from the realities discovered by modern science. Far from providing advanced knowledge or scientific miracles, these texts reflect the limited understanding of ancient peoples.Therefore, the Quran and the teachings of Muhammad cannot be considered reliable sources of scientific knowledge about human procreation. Instead, they serve as historical documents revealing the pre-scientific context of 7th-century Arabia.This realization challenges Islamic claims of divine scientific insight and calls for honest reflection within the theological and academic community regarding the nature and limits of religious texts.References:Quran 86:6-7 (Sahih International)Sahih Muslim 2644 (USC-MSA English Reference)Moore, K.L., Persaud, T.V.N., & Torchia, M.G.

    "full_content": "Where Are the Names of the Disciples of Isa bin Maryam in the Quran?An Academic Challenge to Islam, Allah, and the QuranBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThe Quran asserts its role as a confirmation of the previous scriptures, specifically the Torah (Tawrat) and the Gospel (Injeel). This claim is foundational in Islamic theology, where Muslims believe that the Quran verifies, protects, and clarifies the earlier revelations. However, a close academic scrutiny reveals significant omissions, particularly concerning key details about Isa bin Maryam (Jesus), whose ministry and followers are richly documented in the canonical Gospels. This article raises a direct challenge:Where are the names of the twelve disciples (apostles) of Isa bin Maryam in the Quran?The Theological Foundation1. The Claim of Quranic Completeness and ConfirmationThe Quran boldly declares itself as a “clear explanation of all things” (Quran 16:89) and “confirming what was before it of the Scripture” (Quran 5:48). Muslims are taught that the Quran provides guidance, light, and a criterion for judgment. If this is so, it must preserve or at least acknowledge the foundational facts that the Injeel (Gospel) records without ambiguity.2. The Names of the Apostles in the BibleIn the Christian Scriptures, the twelve apostles are individually named in multiple places (e.g., Matthew 10:2-4, Mark 3:16-19, Luke 6:14-16, Acts 1:13). Their names—Peter, James, John, Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot—are historical, unambiguous, and verifiable within the biblical record.The Quranic Silence1. Absence of Names in the QuranWhile the Quran mentions the “Hawariyyun” (disciples) of Isa (Quran 3:52, 5:111-115, 61:14), it never lists their names, nor does it provide any biographical details. This is a stunning omission, especially considering the Quran’s claim to confirm previous revelation and provide “clarification of all things.”2. The Islamic DilemmaIf the Quran confirms the Injeel, why does it not confirm this basic and universally recognized detail—the names of Jesus’s closest companions? Are the names not important to God? Or was this knowledge unavailable to Muhammad, the purported recipient of the Quranic revelation?3. Theological ImplicationsThe absence is not a trivial gap; it strikes at the heart of the Quran’s claim to completeness and divine authorship. If Allah truly revealed the Injeel and then sent down the Quran to confirm it, the expectation is that at least such fundamental historical truths would be preserved. Instead, the Quran only alludes vaguely to the “disciples” without identifying them.Scholarly ChallengeTo Muslim scholars, apologists, and clerics: Provide the twelve names of the disciples of Isa bin Maryam from the Quranic text.Cite the chapter (surah) and verse (ayah) where these names are found.Show how the Quran fulfills its own standard of confirming the Gospel.If such names cannot be produced from the Quran, then:How can one maintain that the Quran confirms the Gospel?Is the Quran truly “complete” as it claims (Quran 6:115, 16:89)?Or does this omission prove that the Quran is a man-made document, lacking essential historical details known to all biblical and historical sources?The Bible’s Superiority in Preserving RevelationIn contrast, the Christian Bible—both Old and New Testaments—has preserved detailed genealogies, names, places, and historical facts across centuries. The specificity of the biblical record stands in stark contrast to the generalities and omissions of the Quran.ConclusionThe inability of the Quran to provide the names of the twelve disciples of Isa bin Maryam is not merely an academic oversight but a theological indictment. It exposes the incompleteness and human origin of the Quran, which falls short of the standard it claims for itself.Unless verifiable evidence from the Quran is produced, this silence stands as proof that the Quran is not the infallible Word of God, unlike the Bible.References:Quran 3:52, 5:111-115, 61:14 (on the Hawariyyun)Matthew 10:2-4, Mark 3:16-19, Luke 6:14-16 (on the names of the apostles)Quran 5:48, 6:115, 16:89 (on Quranic claims to completeness and confirmation)By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThe doctrine of the attributes of Allah stands as one of the most complex and, at times, controversial aspects within Islamic theology, especially within Sunni orthodoxy. While Muslims affirm that Allah is unique, uncreated, and eternal, they also affirm that Allah possesses attributes—such as speech, knowledge, power, hand, face, and others—that are likewise described as uncreated and eternal. However, Sunni theologians also emphasize that these attributes are “not Allah Himself.” This paradox has generated profound debates throughout Islamic history, and yet the internal logic of this position demands rigorous philosophical and theological scrutiny.The Sunni Doctrine ExplainedSunni Islamic theology, particularly as articulated by the Ash’ari and Maturidi schools, holds the following positions:Allah Exists, Is Uncreated and Eternal:Allah is the unique, necessary, uncreated, and eternal being.Attributes Are Uncreated and Eternal:Allah’s attributes (Sifaat) are likewise uncreated and eternal, existing “with” Allah, but are not Allah Himself.Attributes Are Not Identical to Allah:While Allah cannot exist without His attributes, these attributes are ontologically distinct—they are not Allah, yet neither are they separate beings.Attributes Must Not Be Anthropomorphized:Muslims are forbidden to liken Allah to creation, even when the attributes (such as “hand,” “face,” “speech”) are described using anthropomorphic terms in the Qur’an and Hadith.The Critical QuestionsThis doctrine raises several crucial philosophical and theological questions, which will be posed as part of this debate:A. Can Something Exist, Be Uncreated and Eternal, Yet Not Be God?If the attributes of Allah—such as His knowledge, speech, or face—are themselves uncreated, eternal, and exist alongside Allah, are we not then positing multiple eternals? Islamic monotheism (tawhid) is uncompromising: there can be no partner, associate, or “second eternal” alongside Allah. Yet, if Allah’s attributes are not Allah but are uncreated and eternal, then we are presented with a kind of plurality within the divine essence. How does Sunni theology reconcile absolute divine unity (tawhid) with the real existence of multiple uncreated and eternal attributes that are not identical to Allah?B. Can Allah Exist Without His Attributes?The Quran and Hadith often speak of Allah’s hand, face, speech, knowledge, and will. If Allah’s attributes are not Allah, can Allah exist without them? If not, does it not follow that what is “not Allah” is nevertheless necessary for Allah’s very being? This undermines the classical doctrine of divine simplicity and unity. Are Muslims then claiming that the essence of Allah is dependent on what is “not Allah”?C. If Allah’s Attributes Are Not Allah, What Remains When They Are Removed?This is the heart of the analogy presented above. If every attribute—knowledge, will, power, hand, face, speech, etc.—is “not Allah,” then what is left that constitutes Allah? The logical conclusion is that nothing identifiable or knowable remains. Without attributes, an entity cannot be described, known, or even conceptualized. Are Muslims left worshipping a void, a “zero,” if all attributes are “not Allah”?Philosophical and Theological Implications1. The Problem of Divine PluralityIf all of Allah’s attributes are uncreated and eternal, but “not Allah,” Islamic theology is forced into a problematic position: either these attributes are themselves divine (leading to a kind of polytheism or “divine plurality”), or they are created (which Sunni Islam rejects). This tension mirrors, and in fact, exacerbates, the very objection that Muslims have historically raised against the Christian doctrine of the Trinity—namely, that it introduces plurality within the divine essence. Yet, classical Christianity maintains one essence with three persons, not multiple uncreated “not-Gods” alongside God.2. The Doctrine of Divine SimplicityClassical theism (Jewish, Christian, even many early Islamic philosophers like Ibn Sina) affirms that God is absolutely simple—there are no parts, components, or composition in God. However, the Sunni doctrine of the attributes introduces a real distinction between Allah and His attributes. This undermines the simplicity and unity that tawhid claims to preserve.3. The Knowability of GodIf Allah’s attributes are not Allah, yet these are the only means by which Allah is described, related to, or known, then Allah becomes utterly unknowable. All meaningful language about Allah, in this system, refers not to Allah Himself but only to things that are “not Allah.” This is a deep problem for any claim of divine self-revelation, worship, or relationship.Conclusion: The Dilemma SummarizedThe Sunni assertion that Allah’s attributes are “not Allah” but are uncreated and eternal leads inevitably to one of the following theological dilemmas:Either: There exists a multiplicity of eternals alongside Allah, undermining the very heart of Islamic monotheism.Or: Allah is ultimately unknowable, without any positive attributes, making worship and relationship with Allah impossible.Or: The doctrine is internally inconsistent and cannot sustain rational or theological scrutiny.In summary, if every attribute by which Allah is known is “not Allah,” what, then, is left that can be called “Allah”? Is this not an admission that the Allah of such theology is, in fact, a philosophical abstraction—an empty zero—rather than the living God revealed in Scripture and encountered in worship?Invitation to Muslim ScholarsThis article is written not as a polemic but as a challenge and invitation to Muslim scholars and laypersons alike:Can you present a coherent and rational account of Allah’s attributes that preserves true monotheism, divine simplicity, and the knowability of God? Or does this doctrine collapse into logical and theological incoherence?Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

Names encode historical, theological, and linguistic continuity across texts and centuries. The abrupt appearance of “Yahya” (يحيى) in the Quran, purportedly as the equivalent of the biblical John the Baptist, demands a rigorous linguistic investigation. The evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that “Yahya” is a uniquely Islamic fabrication, with no credible linguistic, historical, or textual precedent prior to the Quran.A. Semitic Transmission of the Name “John”The name John the Baptist enters Arabic through a continuous and well-documented chain of Semitic languages and biblical translations:Hebrew:The original name, יוֹחָנָן (Yochanan), meaning “Yahweh is gracious,” is widely attested in the Hebrew Bible and post-biblical literature.Greek:This becomes Ἰωάννης (Ioánnēs) in the Septuagint and New Testament Greek manuscripts.Syriac:In the Syriac Peshitta—a foundational Christian text for the Middle East—the name is rendered ܝܘܚܢܢ (Yuḥanan), closely mirroring the Hebrew original.Arabic (Pre-Islamic and Early Christian):When Christianity spread into the Arabic-speaking world, early translators rendered the name as يوحنا (Yūḥannā), a direct linguistic descendant of the Hebrew and Syriac forms.1This transmission is attested in ancient biblical manuscripts, liturgical texts, and hagiographies used by Arab Christians long before the rise of Islam. The “Yūḥannā” form is confirmed in the Arabic versions of the Gospels, in inscriptions, and in the works of pre-Islamic Arab poets familiar with Christian themes.2B. The Absence of “Yahya” in Pre-Islamic TraditionNo evidence exists for “Yahya” as a personal name in pre-Islamic Arabia, in any Jewish, Christian, or pagan records. Neither the Dead Sea Scrolls, rabbinic literature, early Arabic poetry, nor Christian liturgy record any prophet or notable figure by this name.Early Arabic Christian texts—such as the Sinai Arabic Codex 151 (9th century, based on earlier traditions), Arabic lectionaries, and the Diatessaron—uniformly use “Yūḥannā.”3Not a single extant document predating the Quran or contemporary with its earliest period refers to John the Baptist as “Yahya.”Even Islamic sources, such as Al-Tabari and Al-Qurtubi, acknowledge the name’s novelty and attempt to justify it theologically, rather than linguistically or historically.4Their explanations are apologetic, not evidential, relying on the idea of divine invention rather than etymological continuity.C. Theoretical Origins: Misinterpretation and Linguistic ErrorSeveral modern scholars propose that Muhammad, with limited exposure to Christian doctrine and the Hebrew-Aramaic scriptures, may have misunderstood the context of the name John. The Hebrew root חיה (ḥ-y-y), meaning “to live,” occasionally features in honorific titles or descriptions of spiritual status (e.g., “he lives before the Lord” or “living in the Spirit”).5It is conceivable that Muhammad or his informants (sometimes called \"Waraka ibn Nawfal\" or unnamed storytellers in Islamic tradition) confused such an epithet with a proper noun and coined “Yahya.”Other Quranic examples of apparent misrenderings or conflations support this hypothesis:The confusion of Mary, the mother of Jesus, with Miriam, the sister of Moses and Aaron (Quran 19:28).[6]The appearance of “Haman” as a minister of Pharaoh in Egypt, though Haman is a Persian character in the Book of Esther.[7]The unique Arabic rendering of Enoch as “Idris,” unattested in biblical or Jewish tradition.[8]These linguistic innovations are not evidence of authentic transmission but of a secondary, derivative, and often erroneous borrowing from biblical tradition.D. Quranic Claim of Uniqueness: Historical and Linguistic ErrorThe Quranic assertion in Surah Maryam 19:7—“We have not assigned to any before [this] name.” (Quran 19:7)—is not merely a claim to novelty but is a historically and linguistically demonstrable error. The name John (Yochanan/Yūḥannā) was not only well known but highly venerated in all relevant linguistic and religious communities for centuries before Muhammad.6The introduction of “Yahya” is thus an unmistakable break in the tradition of name transmission—a rupture that cannot be explained by any process of natural linguistic evolution or scriptural fidelity.E. Testimony of Arabic LexicographyClassical Arabic lexicons compiled before and after the Quran make no mention of “Yahya” as a name, outside the Quranic context.7Edward William Lane’s monumentalArabic-English Lexiconrecords “Yūḥannā” as the Christian name for John and only lists “Yahya” as the Islamic name for the Quranic prophet—derivative, not original.8F. Modern Academic ConsensusLeading contemporary scholars confirm that the Quranic “Yahya” is an invented form:Sidney H. Griffith states: “The Arabic Yūḥannā is the only form attested for John the Baptist among the Christian Arabs; Yahya is a Quranic innovation.”9Gabriel Said Reynolds notes: “The introduction of ‘Yahya’ in the Quran is unprecedented and appears to be a product of confusion with the verb ḥ-y-y (to live), rather than any known tradition.”10G.

Its introduction represents a rupture in the careful transmission of prophetic names—a rupture that points unmistakably to the Quran’s status as a secondary, often erroneous, reimagining of biblical tradition. The name’s uniqueness is not a sign of divine revelation, but of Muhammad’s unfamiliarity with the traditions he sought to appropriate.Footnotes and ReferencesWould you like this expanded into a full academic paper format (with abstract, introduction, etc.), or would you like to focus on further linguistic examples, additional philological details, or more interfaith citations?

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThe critical examination of the Islamic conception of Allah, especially in comparison to the biblical revelation of God, reveals substantial theological dissonance. One of the most controversial attributes ascribed to Allah in the Qur’an is that he is the \"best of deceivers\" (Arabic:makr). In Christian theology, the title \"deceiver\" is reserved for Satan, the adversary of God and man. The present article seeks to expose, through scholarly critique and theological exposition, how the Qur’anic portrayal of Allah aligns more closely with the biblical description of Satan than with the God of the Bible, thereby raising serious doubts about the credibility of Islam.1. The Biblical Identity of Satan as the DeceiverThe Bible is unequivocal in its depiction of Satan as the deceiver. Jesus Himself identifies Satan as “a liar and the father of lies” (John 8:44). In Revelation 12:9, Satan is described as “the great dragon… that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, who leads the whole world astray.” The very character of Satan is deception; his mission is to mislead humanity away from the truth of God.Relevant Biblical References:John 8:44: “You belong to your father, the devil… there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.”2 Corinthians 11:14: “And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.”Revelation 12:9: “…Satan, who leads the whole world astray.”2. Allah as “The Best of Deceivers” in the Qur’anThe Qur’an describes Allah as the “best of planners” or “best of deceivers” (khayru al-makirin). The Arabic wordmakrspecifically refers to cunning, plotting, and deceptive strategy.Qur’anic Evidence:Surah Al-Imran 3:54:“And they (the disbelievers) planned, but Allah planned. And Allah is the best of planners (makirin).”Surah Al-Anfal 8:30:“And [remember] when those who disbelieved plotted against you… but Allah plotted. And Allah is the best of planners.”Islamic exegesis (Tafsir)often admits thatmakrdenotes plotting or cunning, even deception.3. Allah Praying: The Crisis of Divine Self-SufficiencyAs cited in the provided evidence (Al-Adab Al-Mufrad 643), Islamic sources report that “Allah prays” for or upon Muhammad. This is theologically problematic:To whom does Allah pray?Prayer, by definition, is the act of supplication or worship directed to a higher power. If Allah prays, he is necessarily acknowledging one greater than himself, which undermines his supposed transcendence and omnipotence.Biblical God Never Prays:The God of the Bible receives prayer but never prays or supplicates. He is the eternal, self-sufficient “I AM” (Exodus 3:14), the uncreated Creator.4. Theological Implications: Allah and Satan—A Comparative AnalysisA. Shared Attributes of DeceptionBiblical Satan:Master deceiver, father of lies, seducer, and opposer of the truth.Qur’anic Allah:Declares himself the “best of deceivers,” admits to plotting and misleading, even permitting the use of lies (taqiyya) for self-preservation.B. The Incompatibility with Biblical TheologyThe God of the Bible is described as “Light, and in Him there is no darkness at all” (1 John 1:5).He “cannot lie” (Titus 1:2).Deception is utterly contrary to His nature.If the god of the Qur’an openly claims attributes that, according to the Bible, belong to Satan, then it follows that:Allah is not the God of the Bible.Islam is predicated upon a foundation that is theologically antithetical to biblical revelation.Islam, therefore, cannot be trusted as a divine faith, for it enshrines the very qualities the Bible condemns.5. Historical and Doctrinal RamificationsThroughout history, religions have been judged by the character of their deity. A god who is deceitful, who prays to another, and who aligns with the qualities ascribed to the enemy of humanity in Christian doctrine cannot be considered the true God. This exposes Islam as, at best, a human or even satanic fabrication designed to mislead.Supporting Scholarly ReferencesIbn Kathir (Tafsir):Acknowledges that “makr” means cunning and deception.Theological Lexicon of the New Testament (Ceslas Spicq):Contrasts biblical and Quranic conceptions of God’s character.6. Conclusion: Islam as a Fraudulent FaithIn light of the foregoing, the Qur’anic Allah's self-declaration as a deceiver and the admission that he “prays” (thereby acknowledging a higher power) presents a theological crisis that is insurmountable. By biblical standards, Allah's attributes are those of Satan, not the true God. Therefore, Islam, being based on such a conception of deity, is revealed as a fraud, unworthy of trust or faith.Final Scriptural Warning:“Do not be deceived: God is not mocked.” (Galatians 6:7)By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteReferences:The Holy Bible, NIV.The Qur’an, Saheeh International.Al-Adab Al-Mufrad, Book 31, Hadith 643.Ibn Kathir, Tafsir.Theological Lexicon of the New Testament.This article is for scholarly and theological debate purposes and invites critical engagement from all religious and academic communities.",

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThe value and dignity of women have been central questions throughout human history and across religions. The Islamic tradition, particularly as articulated in certain hadiths, has often been critiqued for its portrayal of women in ways that seem to denigrate their moral and spiritual status. One such narration is found inSahih Muslim 1403a, which states:“The woman advances and retires in the shape of a devil, so when one of you sees a woman, he should come to his wife, for that will repel what he feels in his heart.”(Sahih Muslim 1403a, sunnah.com)This article aims to challenge this narrative, analyzing it in light of biblical theology, Christian ethics, and reasoned academic discourse. We contrast it with the teachings of Christ and the broader Christian tradition regarding the human person, sexuality, and the intrinsic worth of women.1. The Islamic Hadith: Context and ImplicationsThe cited hadith from Sahih Muslim presents several theological and ethical problems:Reduction of Women to Objects of Temptation:Women are portrayed as agents of temptation, likened to the devil, whose mere presence is a cause for male lust and a threat to spiritual integrity.Blame Shifting and Moral Evasion:The responsibility for a man's lust is shifted away from the man and onto the woman, suggesting that the antidote to temptation is the act of marital intercourse, rather than personal moral discipline or spiritual renewal.Spiritual Devaluation:The hadith implicitly denies women spiritual agency, reducing their role to a test or a snare rather than co-bearers of the image of God.These implications run contrary to the ethical, psychological, and theological advances made in both modern scholarship and ancient Judeo-Christian traditions.2. The Biblical and Christian Worldview: Women, Temptation, and the MindContrast the above with the Christian Scriptures, which uphold a radically different vision for women and human sexuality:A. Women as Image-BearersFrom the beginning, Scripture affirms the full dignity and equality of women:Genesis 1:27:\"So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.\"Here, both men and women are declared bearers of the Imago Dei, possessing inherent value and moral agency.B. The Heart of Temptation: Responsibility and RenewalJesus’ teaching is both searching and liberating. He does not externalize the source of temptation, nor does He blame women:Matthew 5:27–28:\"Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.\"The locus of sin is within—the heart and mind—not in the body of another. This is a radical internalization of ethical responsibility. Lust is not provoked by the mere presence or form of a woman, but by the condition of the human heart.C. The Discipline of the MindPaul the Apostle further clarifies the Christian approach to intrusive or sinful thoughts:Romans 12:2:\"And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind...\"Philippians 4:8:\"Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest... think on these things.\"2 Corinthians 10:5:\"...bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ...\"The Christian ethic is not to flee to a physical remedy (such as intercourse) but to actively renew the mind and bring thoughts into submission to Christ.D. The Prayer for PurityPsalm 139:23–24:\"Search me, O God, and know my heart... And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.\"The pursuit of purity is a spiritual journey of inward transformation, not an external circumvention of temptation.3. Academic and Ethical Critique of the Islamic NarrativeA. Psychological AnalysisModern psychology affirms that sexual temptation originates internally. External stimuli may trigger, but never cause, lustful thoughts; responsibility lies within the individual. The Islamic hadith, by externalizing the blame, stunts personal growth and moral maturity.B. Historical and Theological ContextThe Quran itself at times upholds the dignity of women (e.g., Quran 33:35), yet the hadith literature—compiled centuries later—often undermines this by introducing misogynistic elements inconsistent with the Quran’s loftier principles and utterly alien to biblical revelation.C. The False Prophet and the Dignity of WomenJesus, regarded in Islam as a prophet, but in Christianity as Lord and Savior, never spoke of women in such dehumanizing terms. The fruits of the so-called “final prophet’s” teachings in the hadith betray a moral and spiritual regression.Isaiah 26:3:\"Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee.\"Peace and purity are the results of a mind anchored in God, not of fleeing to carnal remedies or blaming others.4. Conclusion: Towards a Theological Recovery of Human DignityA theology that reduces women to objects of temptation and blames them for men’s failings is not merely antiquated—it is fundamentally contrary to the gospel of Christ and to reason. True spiritual life, according to Christian revelation, is a matter of inward transformation by the Spirit, personal responsibility, and the mutual upholding of the dignity of all people—men and women alike.The Christian tradition calls us to:Reject misogynistic narrativesthat demonize women.Embrace inward renewaland personal accountability for our thoughts and actions.Affirm the equal dignity and spiritual potentialof both sexes, as co-heirs of grace (1 Peter 3:7).In the final analysis, only a renewed mind, submitted to the Lordship of Christ and rooted in the knowledge of God, can overcome the “carnal mind” and lead to life and peace (Romans 8:6).Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteReferencesSahih Muslim 1403a (sunnah.com/muslim:1403a)The Holy Bible (KJV): Genesis, Psalms, Isaiah, Matthew, Romans, 2 Corinthians, Philippians, 1 PeterThe Quran (33:35)Scholarly works on psychology of temptation and gender ethics",

    "full_content": "A Critical Theological and Logical Analysis of Inconsistencies in Islamic DoctrineBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionOne of the most foundational claims in Islam is that it is not a new religion but the very faith of all prophets from Adam to Muhammad. The Qur’an frequently asserts that “Islam” (submission to God) is the primordial and only valid religion in the eyes of Allah, and that all prophets were “Muslims.” Yet, a deep reading of the Qur’anic text produces a remarkable conundrum: multiple prophets, at different times, are each called “the first Muslim.” This apparent contradiction is not merely a superficial textual overlap, but rather, strikes at the core of Islamic self-understanding and scriptural coherence.In this article, I challenge Islamic scholars and apologists to provide clarity on a matter that, on its face, demonstrates profound internal inconsistency in Islamic doctrine. If Adam was the first human being—and also the first Muslim—how can Moses, Abraham, and Muhammad each also claim the status of “the first Muslim” in their respective eras? This inquiry is vital, not only for the intellectual integrity of Islamic theology but also for those who seek the truth in the Abrahamic traditions.The Qur’anic PassagesLet us examine the Qur’anic verses cited in the attached illustration:Adam: “The First Muslim”Quran 20:115: “And We had already taken a promise from Adam before, but he forgot; and We found not in him determination.”Note: This verse does not explicitly call Adam the first Muslim, but Islamic exegesis often does.Noah, Abraham, and Moses: “The First Muslim”Abraham: Quran 2:132: “And Abraham instructed his sons... ‘Indeed Allah has chosen for you this religion, so do not die except while you are Muslims.’”Moses: Quran 7:143: “And when Moses came at the appointed time and his Lord spoke to him, he asked... I am the first of the believers (Muslimin).”Noah: Quran 10:72: Noah is also described as submitting to Allah, sometimes rendered as “Muslim.”Muhammad: “The First Muslim”Quran 39:12: “And I am commanded to be the first of the Muslims (awwala al-muslimeen).”Logical and Theological Problems1.Chronological InconsistencyIf Adam is truly the first human—and by extension, the first “Muslim”—it is logically impossible for later figures such as Abraham, Moses, or Muhammad to also be the “first” Muslims. The term “first” is absolute, not relative. Once a position is occupied, it cannot be claimed by another, unless the designation is entirely symbolic or contextually limited, which itself undermines any claim to absolute theological truth.2.Contextual AmbiguityIslamic apologists sometimes argue that each prophet is “the first Muslim”of their own people or time. However, the Qur’an does not consistently use qualifying language to support this. Instead, the statements are often universal:Moses: “I am the first of the believers.” (Quran 7:143)Muhammad: “I am commanded to be the first of the Muslims.” (Quran 39:12)This lack of specificity introduces theological ambiguity. If each prophet is only “the first Muslim” in a restricted sense (i.e., within their own era or community), then the title loses its doctrinal weight and devolves into a meaningless redundancy, applicable to any prophet at any time.3.The Nature of Islamic ContinuityIslam claims that its message is unchanged from Adam through Muhammad. If all prophets are Muslims, then Adam is not only the first human but necessarily the first Muslim. Subsequent prophets, being his descendants, are by default following the path already laid out. To retroactively call Abraham, Moses, or Muhammad “the first Muslim” creates a contradiction: it cannot be both that Adam was the first and that others after him can also be the first. If they are “first” in restoring a lost faith, then Islam is not a continual revelation, but an intermittent, revivable tradition—which contradicts the Islamic claim of unbroken continuity.4.Textual Eisegesis and Doctrinal InflationIslamic tradition often reads later doctrine into earlier scripture (eisegesis). The term “Muslim” in Arabic simply means “one who submits.” While it can be used generically, Islam claims it as the exclusive identity of all who follow its tenets. However, the Qur’anic application of “the first Muslim” to different figures appears more as a rhetorical flourish than a precise theological term. If so, the very claim that all prophets were “Muslims” is rendered linguistically and doctrinally suspect.5.Implications for Islamic Salvation HistoryIf the Qur’an’s terminology cannot withstand logical scrutiny, what does this mean for its reliability as a divinely revealed text? If “the first Muslim” can mean multiple things, or apply to multiple people at different times without clear contextual boundaries, then the theological framework of Islam suffers from internal incoherence.Conclusion: A Call for Honest ReappraisalThe question of “Who was the first Muslim?” is not a mere academic curiosity, but a fundamental test of scriptural integrity and doctrinal consistency. The fact that Adam, Abraham, Moses, and Muhammad are all called “the first Muslim” at various points in the Qur’an is not a trivial matter—it exposes a core inconsistency at the heart of Islamic self-definition.I call upon Islamic theologians, apologists, and believers to confront this contradiction with intellectual honesty. How can Islam claim to be the primordial faith if it cannot even maintain consistency in designating its first adherent? Does this multiplicity of “first Muslims” point to a deeper confusion about the nature of Islamic revelation and history?Until such questions are satisfactorily addressed, the claim that Islam is a seamless, internally consistent faith cannot be credibly sustained.Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

    "full_content": "A Theological and Historical DebateBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThe claim that Islam is both the oldest and fastest-growing religion in the world is frequently asserted in Muslim apologetics. Islamic tradition contends that Adam, the first human being, was a Muslim, thereby extending the roots of Islam back to the very beginning of humanity—approximately 6,000 years ago. In contrast, Christianity, as per Muslim narratives, was founded only 2,000 years ago, yet it currently has more adherents worldwide. This article aims to critically examine and debate the veracity of Islamic claims regarding the age and growth of Islam in comparison to Christianity, employing historical data, demographic trends, and theological perspectives.1. Islamic Claims: Islam from Adam?Islamic doctrine asserts that all prophets, from Adam to Muhammad, preached \"Islam\" (submission to the one God). The Qur’an claims,“He [Allah] has chosen you and has not placed upon you in the religion any difficulty. It is the religion of your father, Abraham”(Qur’an 22:78), and further,“Indeed, the religion in the sight of Allah is Islam”(Qur’an 3:19). On this basis, many Muslims maintain that Islam is not merely 1,400 years old (from Muhammad), but as old as humanity itself.Critical AnalysisThis theological assertion, however, is problematic when scrutinized through the lens of historical and textual criticism. No credible archaeological or textual evidence exists to demonstrate that Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, or Jesus practiced Islam in the sense understood today (Shahada, Salat, Zakat, Sawm, Hajj). Rather, these figures are situated in different cultural, historical, and theological contexts, each with distinct beliefs, rituals, and scriptures. The retrojection of Islam onto all previous prophets is a theological assertion, not a historical fact.2. Christianity: Historical Growth and ImpactChristianity, according to most historians, began in the first century AD, with Jesus of Nazareth and his disciples, and rapidly spread throughout the Roman Empire and beyond. Unlike the Islamic narrative, Christianity’s origins and explosive growth are well-documented in both secular and ecclesiastical history.Statistical EvidenceChristianity has approximately2.9 billion adherents(Pew Research Center, 2024), making it the largest religion on earth.Islam, with around1.9 billion adherents, is the second largest.Christianity achieved this growthin less than 2,000 years, compared to Islam’s claim of 6,000 years of existence.3. The Fallacy of the \"Fastest-Growing Religion\" ClaimMuslims often claim that Islam is the \"fastest-growing religion.\" This statement is misleading for several reasons:A. Historical Longevity vs. MembershipIf Islam has truly existed since Adam (6,000 years), why does it lag behind Christianity, which is demonstrably younger, in total adherents? Logically, a religion with a 4,000-year head start should have more followers, not fewer. The numbers do not support the narrative of continuous, uninterrupted Islamic faith from Adam onward.B. Growth Rate MisconceptionsClaims about Islam being the fastest-growing religion often conflate natural population growth in Muslim-majority countries with actual religious conversions. Most demographic studies reveal that the primary driver of Muslim population growth isbirth rate, not conversion.A 2015 Pew Research Center report states:\"Muslims are projected to grow more than twice as fast as the overall world population between 2015 and 2060. But much of this is due to higher fertility rates, not mass conversions.\"C. Christianity’s Global SpreadUnlike Islam, Christianity’s growth is marked by massive global missionary efforts and conversions, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America. In terms of cross-cultural adoption and religious transformation, Christianity has had the most dramatic impact in human history.4. Theological and Philosophical ObjectionsA. Redefining \"Islam\"Muslim apologists redefine \"Islam\" as \"submission to God,\" then retroactively apply it to all righteous figures. But this is not what is meant by \"Islam\" today—a faith defined by the Qur’an, the Sunnah, and specific rituals. Historical Judaism, Christianity, and the ancient faiths of the Near East had fundamentally different beliefs and practices.B. Contradictions in the Islamic NarrativeIf Islam was the original and universal faith, why do we seeno evidence of Islamic practices before Muhammad—no mosques, no Qur’an, no record of the Shahada, no Ramadan, no Hajj to Mecca among ancient Israelites or Christians? To claim continuity without evidence is to make an untestable assertion.5. Conclusion: A Call for Intellectual HonestyThis debate reveals a fundamental weakness in the Islamic apologetic narrative:Historically, Christianity is younger yet outpaces Islam in both adherents and global influence.Demographically, Islam’s growth is primarily due to higher birth rates, not conversions.Theologically, the claim that all prophets were \"Muslims\" is unsupported by evidence and amounts to anachronistic revisionism.Therefore, if the criterion for a \"fastest-growing\" religion is based on total adherents over time, Christianity—not Islam—holds that distinction.I challenge my Muslim counterparts to present verifiable evidence, not mere assertions, if they wish to maintain their claim. Until then, the logical, historical, and statistical case rests solidly with Christianity.Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteReferences:Pew Research Center, “The Future of World Religions: Population Growth Projections, 2010-2050,” 2015; updated data, 2024.The Qur’an, Surah 3:19, 22:78.The Bible, Acts 2:41-47; Matthew 28:19-20.Academic literature on religious demographics and historical origins.",

    "full_content": "An Academic Analysis of Quran 33:50 and Its Societal ImpactBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis article presents a critical theological and scientific analysis of the Islamic allowance of consanguineous marriages, as derived from Quran 33:50 and the prophetic practices of Muhammad. Through exegetical engagement with Islamic texts and interdisciplinary consultation with genetic science, this paper aims to challenge the doctrinal and practical legitimacy of intra-family marriages, highlighting the resultant negative consequences for contemporary Muslim societies.1. IntroductionMarriage customs are foundational to the ethical, cultural, and biological health of societies. Across history, religious traditions have shaped the parameters of permissible marital unions. In Islam, the Quran and the Hadith corpus provide explicit guidelines concerning the permissibility of marrying relatives, a practice embodied by Muhammad himself. This article critically interrogates the theological rationale behind these allowances and presents a comprehensive analysis of the deleterious effects of such practices, particularly in the light of modern genetics and global health.2. Quranic Permission for Consanguineous MarriageQuran 33:50states:“O Prophet! Verily, We have made lawful to you your wives to whom you have paid their dowries, and those whom your right hand possesses out of the prisoners of war whom Allah has assigned to you, and the daughters of your paternal uncles and aunts, and the daughters of your maternal uncles and aunts, who emigrated with you…”(Sahih Internationaltranslation)This verse explicitly permits Muhammad to marry his cousins and by extension, it has shaped Islamic jurisprudence regarding the lawfulness of cousin marriage (consanguinity). Islamic law (fiqh) remains distinctive among world religions for its wide acceptance of intra-familial unions, especially first-cousin marriages (see:Sahih Bukhari 62:27). Muhammad’s own marriage to Zaynab bint Jahsh, his paternal cousin (see Quran 33:37), established a direct prophetic precedent.3. Theological Implications: A Comparative CritiqueWhile Islam authorizes cousin marriages, both Judaism and Christianity, particularly in their later doctrinal and canonical developments, imposed increasing restrictions on such unions. For instance,Leviticus 18:6-18enumerates prohibited degrees of kinship for marriage, based on the principle ofkedushah(holiness/separation). The Christian tradition, especially post-early church councils, further expanded prohibitions on consanguinity to protect both spiritual and physical well-being.This theological divergence is not arbitrary; it reflects a teleological concern for the integrity and flourishing of the human family as an image-bearing community (Genesis 1:27; 2 Corinthians 6:17). The Islamic position, as reflected in both scripture and prophetic practice, appears more permissive, arguably due to the tribal social structure of 7th-century Arabia, yet this raises ethical and theological questions in the context of God’s design for human health and diversity.4. Muhammad’s Example and Its Enduring InfluenceThe personal example of Muhammad, who married Zaynab bint Jahsh (his cousin), serves as the behavioral model for Muslims, as Muhammad is described asuswa hasana—the “beautiful pattern” (Quran 33:21). This prophetic endorsement has perpetuated the practice among Muslims globally. According to the United Nations Population Fund,consanguineous marriage rates in Muslim-majority countriesremain significantly higher than in non-Muslim regions, with cousin marriages comprising up to 50% of all unions in some communities (UNFPA, 2022).5. Scientific and Biological Consequences of ConsanguinityModern genetics offers a stark warning regarding the practice of marrying close relatives. Consanguineous marriages dramatically increase the risk of congenital disorders and genetic diseases due to the increased probability of inheriting autosomal recessive conditions.5.1 Genetic RisksHigher Incidence of Birth Defects:Research shows that children born to first-cousin unions have a 2–3 times higher risk of congenital malformations, intellectual disability, and hereditary diseases (Bittles, A.H., 2001,The Lancet).Increased Infant Mortality:Studies indicate higher infant and child mortality rates among populations practicing regular consanguinity.Long-Term Health Burden:Communities with persistent intra-family marriage exhibit higher rates of genetic illnesses (e.g., thalassemia, cystic fibrosis, spinal muscular atrophy).5.2 Societal and Ethical ImpactThe social normalization of consanguineous marriages in Muslim-majority countries perpetuates a cycle of genetic illness and poses ethical questions about the stewardship of human life and health. The World Health Organization and medical ethicists recommend against cousin marriages due to these well-documented risks.6. Conclusion: Theological and Scientific ResponsibilityThe Quranic allowance for cousin marriage (Quran 33:50), modeled by Muhammad, has had a lasting and measurable impact on the health of Muslim societies. From a theological perspective, this raises questions about the nature of divine legislation and its consonance with the well-being of humanity. Scientifically, the evidence is unequivocal: intra-family marriages carry grave genetic risks that are neither compatible with the biblical ethos of life preservation nor with modern principles of bioethics.A Call to ReconsiderationFor the sake of public health, theological integrity, and future generations, it is incumbent upon religious scholars, community leaders, and policymakers to reconsider and reformulate marital norms in light of both scriptural evidence and scientific reality. True religion should not perpetuate harm but should uphold the flourishing of the human family in all its diversity.ReferencesThe Holy Quran, 33:50, 33:37, 33:21Sahih Bukhari 62:27The Holy Bible, Leviticus 18:6-18, Genesis 1:27, 2 Corinthians 6:17Bittles, A.H.

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThroughout history, the nature and character of God have been central to the world’s great monotheistic faiths. However, while both Islam and Christianity profess belief in one God, the conception of God’s character, particularly regarding truthfulness and deception, diverges significantly between the Bible and the Qur’an. This article offers a rigorous theological critique of the Islamic concept of Allah in light of key biblical doctrines, exposing critical incompatibilities and affirming the unique deity of Jesus Christ as revealed in Scripture.I. The God of the Bible: The Impossibility of DeceitIn biblical theology, God’s truthfulness is not merely an attribute but an essential aspect of His very being. The Bible insists repeatedly that God cannot lie or act contrary to His own righteous nature:“God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?”Numbers 23:19, KJV1Paul reiterates this foundational truth:“In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began.”Titus 1:2, KJV2The writer of Hebrews declares the impossibility of God lying:“…in which it is impossible for God to lie…”Hebrews 6:18, ESV3These verses collectively reveal that truthfulness is intrinsic to the divine identity. The impossibility of deceit is not a voluntary limitation, but a logical necessity of God’s nature as the ultimate moral being.II. The Qur’anic Depiction of Allah: The “Best of Deceivers”?A profound challenge to the biblical doctrine arises in the Qur’an, which describes Allah using terms associated with deception. Consider Surah 3:54:“And they (the disbelievers) planned, but Allah planned. And Allah is the best of planners.”Qur’an 3:54, Sahih International4The key Arabic word here ismakara, which has a semantic range that includes “to plot,” “to scheme,” “to deceive,” or “to act with guile.” Notably, more literal translations render it:“And they cheated/deceived and Allah cheated/deceived, and Allah is the best of the cheaters/deceivers.”Qur’an 3:54, M. A. Samira5Classical Islamic commentaries do not dispute the usage of makara in this sense; rather, they interpret Allah’s “deception” as a righteous response to the deception of others. However, from a biblical perspective, such attribution of deceit—even in response to evil—stands in direct contradiction to the holy nature of God.Other Qur’anic passages echo this troubling attribute:“And (the unbelievers) schemed, and Allah schemed against them: and Allah is the best of schemers.”Qur’an 8:30, Pickthall6The repeated use ofmakarafor Allah’s actions raises critical theological questions: Can the one true God ever justifiably engage in deception? Does moral relativism apply to the divine nature?III. Satan: The Biblical Paradigm of DeceptionIn stark contrast to the Qur’anic depiction, the Bible ascribes all deception, cunning, and falsehood to Satan, the great adversary of God and humanity:“…that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world…”Revelation 12:9, KJV7Jesus further clarifies the origin of all lies:“You are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks out of his own character, for he is a liar and the father of lies.”John 8:44, ESV8Scripture is consistent and absolute: deception is wholly incompatible with the holy nature of God and is the very signature of Satan.IV. The Uniqueness of Jesus Christ: Sinlessness and DivinityRemarkably, both the Bible and the Qur’an bear witness to the sinlessness and unique holiness of Jesus Christ:Biblical Testimony“He committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth.”1 Peter 2:22, ESV9“Which of you convicts me of sin?”John 8:46, ESV“…Holy, innocent, unstained, separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens.”Hebrews 7:26, ESVQur’anic Testimony“He said: ‘I am only a messenger of thy Lord, to announce to thee the gift of a holy son.’”Qur’an 19:19, Yusuf Ali10No other prophet—neither Moses, Abraham, Muhammad, nor any other—is described as “holy” or sinless in such absolute terms in either scripture.Jesus, furthermore, declares Himself to be the personification of truth:“I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no one comes to the Father except through me.”John 14:6, ESV11If perfect truthfulness is the mark of God, and Jesus alone fulfills this without the stain of sin or deceit, then by biblical and Qur’anic testimony, Jesus alone is qualified to be called God.V. Theological Implications and Critical ReflectionThe Qur’an’s depiction of Allah as the “best of deceivers” presents a profound theological crisis. If the standard of deity is set by the biblical revelation—utter moral perfection and incapacity for falsehood—then the Qur’anic Allah cannot be identified as the same God as YHWH, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The God of the Bible cannot lie. The Qur’anic Allah can and does.This contrast is not a matter of semantics but of the very essence of God. As C.S. Lewis argued, “If God is not good, then He is not God at all.”12Any being who deceives, regardless of motivation, cannot be the God of truth and light.Furthermore, the evidence points unerringly to Jesus Christ, who, according to both sacred texts, is uniquely sinless and absolutely true. As such, the only logical and theological conclusion is that Jesus is indeed God incarnate, and that the standard of deity is met in Him alone.ConclusionThe integrity of God’s character stands or falls on the issue of truthfulness. The biblical God is a God who cannot lie; the Qur’anic Allah is described as a deceiver. By the standards set in Scripture, only Jesus Christ—the sinless, holy, and truthful Son—is truly God. To worship any other is to exchange the truth of God for a lie.By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteFootnotesFor further engagement or scholarly dialogue, please contact Shimba Theological Institute.Would you like further expansion on any specific subtopic, additional rebuttals to common Islamic objections, or more references from classical Islamic sources?FootnotesNumbers 23:19, King James Version (KJV).↩Titus 1:2, KJV.↩Hebrews 6:18, English Standard Version (ESV).↩Qur’an 3:54, Sahih International.

This article explores the Qur’anic narrative of this metaphor and compares it with its treatment in the words of Jesus Christ, aiming to uncover deeper theological meanings regarding the nature and limits of divine power.1Qur’anic Perspective: The Inaccessibility of Paradise for Deniers of God’s SignsLet us begin by examining the relevant passage from the Qur’an, Surah Al-A‘raf (7:40):\"Indeed, those who deny Our signs and are arrogant towards them—the gates of heaven will not be opened for them, nor will they enter Paradise until the camel passes through the eye of the needle. Thus do We recompense the criminals.\"(Qur’an 7:40, Saheeh International)2This passage asserts that those who reject Allah’s signs will categorically be denied access to Paradise, a prohibition described as so absolute that it would only be reversed if a camel could pass through the eye of a needle—an event that is, by all human reckoning, impossible. The Qur’anic metaphor thus emphasizes the utter impossibility of salvation for those who persistently reject divine revelation.3The New Testament: Divine Omnipotence in the Teachings of Jesus ChristIn contrast, the New Testament presents the same imagery in a different theological light. Jesus uses the phrase in His teachings about the difficulty of a rich man entering the kingdom of God:Mark 10:25: \"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.\"4Luke 18:25: \"Indeed, it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.\"5Matthew 19:24: \"Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.\"6However, Jesus immediately follows this metaphor with a critical theological assertion regarding divine possibility:Mark 10:27: \"Jesus looked at them and said, ‘With man it is impossible, but not with God. For all things are possible with God.’\"7This key distinction establishes that, while human effort is insufficient to achieve what is metaphorically impossible, God’s omnipotence transcends all human limitations.8Theological Implications: Divine Power in Christianity versus IslamThe Qur’anic statement in Surah Al-A‘raf presents an impossibility as an insurmountable barrier, even by divine decree.9Conversely, the Christian Scriptures, while affirming the impossibility of the task for humans, assert unequivocally that for God, nothing is impossible (see alsoEphesians 3:20: \"Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us.\"10). This claim serves as a cornerstone of Christian faith in the absolute omnipotence of God manifested in Jesus Christ (cf.Titus 2:1311).ConclusionA careful comparison of these texts highlights a significant doctrinal divergence between Islam and Christianity regarding the limits—or lack thereof—of divine ability. The Qur’anic text sets an absolute limit for certain sinners, while the New Testament proclaims a God who is unconstrained by any impossibility. Thus, the person of Jesus Christ is presented as possessing the power to accomplish what is otherwise unachievable, affirming His divinity and omnipotence.12Shalom,Dr. Maxwell ShimbaServant of Jesus Christ, the Most High God (Titus 2:13)References & FootnotesIf you need this in a different citation style (e.g., APA, Chicago footnotes, SBL), or would like expanded academic references, please specify!FootnotesFor a broader treatment of comparative monotheism, see: Parrinder, Geoffrey.Jesus in the Qur’an.

For adherents, the prophet's moral and personal life sets a paradigm of spiritual conduct. In Islamic tradition, Muhammad is held as al-Insan al-Kamil (“the perfect human”). However, when subjected to historical scrutiny and theological analysis, significant inconsistencies and moral deficiencies emerge, challenging his claim to prophetic perfection.Historical Testimony: Muhammad’s Eating HabitsCiting the historical workKitabu cha Historia ya Mtume Muhammadby Mohammed Riday of Mombasa, Kenya (p.176, paragraph 5), we read:\"Prophet Muhammad would not eat until he was overtaken by hunger, and even when he did eat, he was never satisfied…\"\"This is a prophet of Allah, who, when eating, never seemed to be satisfied, often eating until he was overfull. Beyond this, he was described as selfish in his habits.\"Such descriptions from Muslim historical sources themselves point to a portrait of Muhammad that diverges significantly from the traditional narrative of asceticism and generosity. The implication of selfishness and insatiability in a prophet, especially regarding food, demands serious theological reflection.Quranic Evidence: Restriction and Social ConductSurah Al-Ahzab 33:53 provides further insight:“O you who believe! Do not enter the Prophet’s houses—except when you are permitted for a meal, without waiting for its readiness. But when you are invited, then enter; and when you have eaten, disperse, without seeking to remain for conversation. Verily, that would cause annoyance to the Prophet, and he would be shy of you; but Allah is not shy of [telling you] the truth... And it is not [right] for you to offend the Messenger of Allah, nor to marry his wives after him, ever. Indeed, that would be an enormity in the sight of Allah.”(Qur'an 33:53)This verse reveals a Prophet who, far from being hospitable, is so troubled by the presence of guests and extended conversation that divine revelation is invoked to regulate social conduct around his home. The instruction is clear: do not linger after eating, do not engage in casual conversation, and do not “annoy” the Prophet. The Quran, in this context, appears to serve the Prophet’s personal comfort rather than any divine or communal ethical ideal.Theological Analysis: Selfishness as an Unprophetic TraitTheologically, selfishness is universally recognized as a vice, not a virtue. In the Judeo-Christian tradition, selfishness is associated with sin and even with Satan. The Bible, for instance, teaches selflessness, hospitality, and generosity as marks of true godliness (see Matthew 25:35; Hebrews 13:2). By contrast, the characteristics described in both historical sources and the Qur’anic text attribute to Muhammad behaviors that contradict prophetic ideals.Selfishness is a trait of Satan, not of a true Prophet of God.Implications for Islamic TheologyIf the Prophet of Islam is depicted as greedy, never satisfied, and selfish—even necessitating divine revelation to shield himself from his own followers—how can such a figure serve as the model of righteousness for humanity? How does this comport with the Islamic claim that Muhammad was the best example (uswa hasana) for mankind (Qur’an 33:21)?Furthermore, the contrast with Jesus Christ is profound. Jesus is consistently depicted in the Gospels as generous, self-sacrificing, and inviting all—even to the point of washing his disciples’ feet (John 13:1-17) and feeding the multitudes (Matthew 14:13-21), never using divine revelation to serve his own convenience or personal comfort.ConclusionThe evidence from Islamic history and the Qur’an itself presents Muhammad as a prophet whose actions and revelations often served personal interests and comfort, not higher moral ideals. This challenges the claim of his moral perfection and raises serious questions for those who seek to follow him as the exemplar of human conduct.Selfishness and insatiability are not prophetic qualities, but rather marks of spiritual deficiency. If these are the characteristics of Muhammad, then serious reconsideration is required regarding his status as a prophet of the living God.To my Muslim friends, I ask: Can you truly claim that selfishness and personal comfort—traits more aligned with Satan than with the prophets—should be emulated as a model of divine life?References:Mohammed Riday,Kitabu cha Historia ya Mtume Muhammad, Mombasa, Kenya, p. 176.Qur’an, Surah Al-Ahzab 33:53.The Holy Bible, Matthew 25:35; Hebrews 13:2; John 13:1-17; Matthew 14:13-21.",

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThe claim that the Bible is both corrupted and yet useful as evidence for the Qur’an presents a logical and theological contradiction within Islamic apologetics. This article critically examines the practice of referencing the Bible within Islamic discourse, highlighting the inherent inconsistency and challenging Muslims to reconcile this contradiction in the light of their own scripture and theological framework.1. Introduction: The Paradox of Scriptural ReferenceIslamic polemics and apologetics frequently utilize the Bible as a reference to support the Qur’an or the prophethood of Muhammad. Yet, a central tenet in Islamic doctrine is the claim that the Bible (both Old and New Testaments) has been corrupted (tahrif). This raises a fundamental question:Why would Muslims quote from a text they consider unreliable, altered, and no longer trustworthy?The use of a “corrupt” text as authoritative evidence is, at best, problematic; at worst, it undermines the very foundation of the Islamic critique against Christian doctrine.2. The Qur’anic Position: Appeal to Previous ScriptureThe Qur’an itself addresses the relationship between the revelation given to Muhammad and the earlier scriptures:“So if you are in doubt, [O Muhammad], about that which We have revealed to you, then ask those who have been reading the Scripture before you.”(Qur’an 10:94)This verse is critical. It demonstrates that Muhammad is instructed to consult the “People of the Book”—Jews and Christians—about the authenticity and understanding of the Qur’anic message. If, at the time of Muhammad, the Bible was already corrupted, why would Allah direct Muhammad to seek verification or clarification from the possessors of a corrupted text? The Qur’an presupposes the reliability of the existing scriptures, at least at the time of its own revelation.3. The Hadith and Early Muslim AttitudesMuslim tradition, as seen in theHadith literature, reflects uncertainty regarding the use of previous scriptures:Narrated Ubaidullah: Ibn `Abbas said, \"Why do you ask the people of the scripture about anything while your Book (the Qur'an) which has been revealed to Allah's Apostle is newer and the latest?”(Sahih al-Bukhari Vol. 9, Book 87, Hadith 111)Here, Ibn Abbas criticizes the consultation of Jewish and Christian scriptures, suggesting the superiority and sufficiency of the Qur’an. This reveals an inherent tension in early Islamic thought: If the Qur’an is truly the final revelation and the Bible is allegedly corrupt, what possible apologetic value can there be in quoting the Bible to support Islamic claims?4. The Christian Position: The Integrity and Permanence of the BibleChristian theology asserts the incorruptibility and divine preservation of scripture:“All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness.”(2 Timothy 3:16)“Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will never pass away.”(Matthew 24:35)From a Christian perspective, the Bible is the unchanging, inspired Word of God. Its textual transmission and preservation are attested by historical manuscript evidence and the internal testimony of scripture itself. The claim of corruption is not only unsupported by historical evidence but also inconsistent with the Qur’an’s own references to the earlier scriptures as reliable.5. The Logical DilemmaThe act of quoting the Bible while denouncing it as corrupted is akin to using a broken compass to prove your map is accurate. If the Bible is truly unreliable, any appeal to its authority is self-refuting. Conversely, if the Bible is reliable, as the Qur’an initially affirms, then its testimony concerning the divinity of Christ, the crucifixion, and the gospel message must be seriously considered—yet these core doctrines are denied by Islam.Thus,Muslims are faced with a logical trilemma:If the Bible is corrupted, quoting it proves nothing.If the Bible is not corrupted, Islam must be judged by its witness.If Islam needs the Bible to validate itself but the two contradict, then the Islamic position collapses under its own inconsistency.6. Conclusion: An Invitation to ConsistencyFor meaningful interfaith dialogue and authentic theological inquiry, consistency is paramount. If Muslims truly believe the Bible is corrupted, they should refrain from quoting it as proof for Islamic claims. If they find the Bible reliable, intellectual honesty demands a serious engagement with its teachings—even when these challenge or contradict Islamic doctrine.“If the Bible is corrupted, stop quoting it. If it’s not, follow it.”ReferencesQur’an 10:942 Timothy 3:16Matthew 24:35Sahih al-Bukhari Vol. 9, Book 87, Hadith 111Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

However, Qur’an 33:53 (al-Ahzab) provides an intriguing case where the distinction between divine revelation and personal interests becomes blurred. A close reading exposes internal evidence that suggests Muhammad, rather than Allah, is the true author behind this verse.The Content and Context of Qur’an 33:53Qur’an 33:53(Sahih International translation):“O you who have believed, do not enter the houses of the Prophet except when you are permitted for a meal, without awaiting its readiness. But when you are invited, then enter; and when you have eaten, disperse without seeking to remain for conversation. Indeed, that was troubling the Prophet, and he is shy of you. But Allah is not shy of the truth…”Here, the verse is directed to the believers, instructing them on etiquette regarding the Prophet’s house. But a peculiar admission emerges:“Indeed, that was troubling the Prophet, and he is shy of you. But Allah is not shy of the truth.”This admission raises critical questions:Who is Troubled?The verse openly says it is Muhammad (“the Prophet”) who is troubled by people lingering in his house after meals.Who is Shy?The text admits Muhammad is “shy” about telling people to leave, but “Allah is not shy of the truth,” implying that Allah is supposedly intervening where Muhammad is too embarrassed to speak.Who is the Speaker?The style shifts abruptly from instructing the people, to explaining Muhammad’s feelings, then providing justification for what is presented as Allah’s direct words.Logical Analysis: Who is Really Speaking?A. The Human Element in Divine SpeechIf this verse is the word of Allah, then why does it center on Muhammad’s personal feelings (“he is shy of you”), his comfort, and his social awkwardness? Is it befitting for the eternal God to interrupt the flow of divine revelation to address the social discomforts of a single individual, especially in such a mundane context?B. The Speaker’s IdentityA logical reading asks: Who is narrating here? Is Allah narrating Muhammad’s emotions to the believers? Or is Muhammad, feeling shy to address his guests, claiming divine sanction for his personal need? The narrative voice becomes inconsistent—at times Allah, at times Muhammad’s own inner thoughts.C. The Absence of Universal ApplicationDivine revelation, in all monotheistic traditions, provides principles that are universal and transcend the prophet’s personal needs. Yet this verse is a personal solution for Muhammad’s inconvenience, not a moral or spiritual law.Theological Critique: Contradiction to Divine AttributesImpersonal Decree vs. Personal ConvenienceIf Allah is almighty, why would He reveal a verse simply to manage Muhammad’s household inconvenience?Does God become the mouthpiece for Muhammad’s personal comfort, or does Muhammad use God’s authority to resolve his own social anxieties?The Voice of the VerseThroughout the Qur’an, Allah speaks in the first person or commands via the second person. In this verse, the narrative switches awkwardly to comment on Muhammad’s emotions, something expected from a human narrator, not a divine one.Prophetic Model in Previous ScripturesNowhere in the Hebrew Bible or New Testament do we find God intervening solely to protect a prophet’s personal comfort from guests, let alone admit the prophet is too shy to speak. Prophets such as Moses, Elijah, or Jesus are often bold and forthright, their human needs never dressed up as divine revelation.The Critical QuestionIf this verse is truly Allah’s word, then why does it serve only Muhammad’s immediate, mundane need, and why does it admit the prophet is too shy to confront his own guests?Did Allah appear and directly speak to the people to resolve Muhammad’s shyness, or is this Muhammad himself, using “Allah” as a rhetorical tool to command respect and privacy?Who was actually speaking “mouth to mouth and face to face” to the people here? The verse suggests an observer aware of Muhammad’s emotional discomfort, which is inconsistent with a transcendent, omnipotent God.ConclusionBy examining Qur’an 33:53 in its literary, logical, and theological context, it becomes evident that this verse is best explained as Muhammad’s own words, articulated for his personal benefit and codified under divine authority. The verse reveals a human author who is too embarrassed to ask guests to leave, and thus attributes his wish to God. This raises profound doubts about the claim that the Qur’an is purely the word of Allah and not the word of Muhammad.Unless Muslims can demonstrate that it was truly Allah—speaking directly and not just Muhammad’s self-interest—who dictated this passage, the evidence from the verse itself remains damning:the Qur’an, at least in this instance, is the word of Muhammad, not the word of God.References:Qur’an 33:53 (al-Ahzab)Various classical and modern Islamic exegesis (tafsir)Comparative analysis with the prophetic voice in the BibleBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological Institute",

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis article critically investigates the claim of Allah’s omnipotence (all-powerful nature) within Islamic theology, focusing on the historical incident of Muhammad’s poisoning at Khaibar. It argues that the inability of Allah to prevent, heal, or answer the prophetic prayers of Muhammad undermines the assertion of Allah’s unlimited power. By scrutinizing the Islamic primary sources and theological claims, this report demonstrates that Allah’s power is, at best, a claim without consistent demonstrable evidence—particularly in the life and death of Islam’s own prophet.1. IntroductionThe doctrine of divine omnipotence is foundational to the concept of God in both Islamic and Christian theology. However, the real test of such an attribute is not merely in claims but in the historical and empirical manifestations of that power—especially towards the most favored and chosen prophets. In Islam, Muhammad is considered the “Seal of the Prophets,” and thus the manner of his life and death reflects directly on the character and ability of Allah. The poisoning incident at Khaibar (as recorded in multiple hadith sources) presents a severe challenge to the Islamic claim that Allah is all-powerful and attentive to the prayers of His prophets.2. The Incident at Khaibar: A Brief Historical AccountAccording to Sahih al-Bukhari and other major Islamic sources, after the conquest of Khaibar, a Jewish woman offered Muhammad poisoned meat (specifically, a roasted sheep). Muhammad consumed the meat, realized it was poisoned, and reportedly suffered lingering effects until his death years later.Sahih Bukhari 4428:\"When the Prophet was poisoned at Khaibar, he said: ‘I feel the effects of that poison from this very moment.’”(See also: Sunan Abu Dawood 4512, Sahih Muslim 5840.)Muhammad is reported to have prayed for healing, yet, the poison remained effective, ultimately contributing to his death. This fact is unambiguous in classical Islamic sources.3. Theological Implications: Allah’s Power in Question3.1. Why Didn’t Allah Save Muhammad?If Allah is all-powerful (Qur’an 2:20, 2:106, 6:61), why did He not prevent His final prophet from ingesting poison? The omnipotent deity, by definition, should have the capability to intervene in any circumstance—especially to protect His chosen messenger from harm. The failure to do so casts doubt on the absoluteness of Allah’s power.3.2. Why Did Muhammad’s Prayers Fail?The Qur’an repeatedly claims that Allah answers the prayers of His prophets:“When My servants ask you concerning Me, I am indeed close: I listen to the prayer of every suppliant when he calls on Me.”—Qur’an 2:186Yet, in the case of Khaibar, Muhammad’s supplications for healing were not answered. If even the greatest prophet’s prayers went unanswered, does this not suggest a limitation—either in Allah’s willingness, power, or both?3.3. Allah’s Inaction: Absence of EvidenceDivine omnipotence must be evidenced by consistent acts of deliverance and intervention, particularly for God’s own messengers. The Khaibar incident offers no such evidence, only a claim that is not substantiated by reality. Allah’s supposed power remains abstract, unmanifested in crucial moments.4. Comparative Theology: The Biblical God vs. AllahThe God of the Bible consistently demonstrates power by protecting, rescuing, and sometimes even resurrecting His prophets (Daniel 6:22, 1 Kings 17:21-22). Jesus, in particular, declares that He lays down His life of His own accord (John 10:18)—not at the mercy of human schemes or poison. The impotence of Allah in Muhammad’s final crisis stands in stark contrast to the Biblical model of divine omnipotence.5. The Omnipotence Claim: Philosophical and Logical Evaluation5.1. The Problem of Selective PowerA deity whose power is manifest only in select, unverifiable circumstances, but is absent in the most vital instances (such as the protection of His own prophet), cannot logically be called omnipotent.5.2. Internal Contradiction in the Qur’anWhile the Qur’an asserts Allah’s omnipotence, it also narrates stories where Allah’s power is either absent or conditional, contradicting the definition of absolute power (Qur’an 8:17 vs. 69:44-46).6. Conclusion: Allah’s Omnipotence—A Claim Without EvidenceThe incident of Muhammad’s poisoning exposes a critical flaw in Islamic theology. If Allah was unable (or unwilling) to save or heal his prophet, then Allah’s power is either limited or unreliable. This is not the mark of an omnipotent deity, but of a being whose power exists only in unsubstantiated claims and dogmatic assertions.A God who cannot, or does not, save His own messenger from such an ignoble and painful death cannot be trusted as all-powerful, nor as the true God worthy of ultimate allegiance.ReferencesSahih al-Bukhari 4428Sahih Muslim 5840Sunan Abu Dawood 4512The Qur’an: 2:20, 2:106, 6:61, 2:186, 8:17, 69:44-46The Bible: Daniel 6:22, 1 Kings 17:21-22, John 10:18By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

While many Muslim polemicists have accused Paul of corrupting the message of Jesus, an examination of classical Islamic exegesis, especially on Surah Ya-Sin (Qur’an 36:13-17), reveals a dramatically different tradition—one in which Paul (Bulus) is actually recognized as a messenger (rasūl) sent by Allah, associated with the Messiah (al-Masīḥ, i.e., Jesus). This article explores the evidence from primary Islamic sources—Qur’an, Tafsir, and Hadith—that confirm the respected status of Paul in early Islamic thought.1. Paul in the Qur’an and Tafsir Literature1.1 Qur’an 36:13-17: The Three Messengers to AntiochSurah Ya-Sin verses 13–17 narrate the story of a city that received three messengers, yet rejected them. The Qur’an itself does not name these messengers, but the major classical exegetes do.Your provided screenshot fromTafsir Ibn Kathir(see attached andonline reference) directly states:“The names of the first two Messengers were Sham‘un and Yuhanna, and the name of the third was Bulus (Paul), and the city was Antioch (Antakiyah).”– Ibn Kathir, Tafsir on Surah Ya-Sin 36:14.Bulusis the Arabic name for Paul, andAntakiyahis the Arabic for Antioch—a known center of early Christianity and a place historically associated with Paul’s missionary journeys (Acts 13:1-3). The same is confirmed in other tafsir works, such as Tafsir al-Tabari and Tafsir al-Qurtubi.1.2 The Messengers as Disciples of JesusThe exegesis further states:“Qatādah bin Di‘āmah claimed that they were messengers of the Messiah, peace be upon him, sent to the people of Antioch.”This directly contradicts the polemical view that Paul corrupted the message of Jesus. Instead, Paul is seen in these Islamic sources as a true emissary of Christ, appointed and sent to spread his message.1.3 Multiple Sources Confirming PaulOther Tafsir works:Tafsir al-Tabari (20:500):Echoes the names Sham‘un (Simon Peter), Yuhanna (John), and Bulus (Paul) as the messengers.Tafsir al-Qurtubi:Also narrates the story with the same names.Contemporary Islamic scholarsrarely mention this tradition, but it is clear that the earliest and most authoritative commentators on the Qur’an identified Paul as a genuine, divinely appointed messenger.2. Support from Hadith and Early Islamic Historians2.1 Historical Traditions (Akhbar)Early Islamic historians and hadith transmitters recorded similar narrations:Al-Tabari,Tārīkh al-Rusul wa’l-Mulūk(History of Prophets and Kings):“Jesus sent to Antioch two of his disciples, Simon and John. When they were opposed, he sent a third, Paul, to support them.”Ibn Ishaq (as cited by Ibn Kathir):The disciples of Jesus, who spread his message after his ascension, included Sham‘un (Simon Peter), Yuhanna (John), and Bulus (Paul), among others.2.2 Hadith LiteratureAlthough there is no direct sahih (authentic) hadith mentioning Paul by name as a disciple, numerous hadith collections affirm that Jesus had disciples (al-Hawariyyūn) who spread his message:Sahih Muslim 302:“The Prophet (Muhammad) said, ‘Both in this world and in the Hereafter, I am the nearest of all the people to Jesus, the son of Mary. The prophets are paternal brothers; their mothers are different, but their religion is one.’”This hadith, while general, supports the notion that the mission and succession of messengers after Jesus—including his disciples—were part of a continuous divine plan, which, as the tafsir shows, included Paul.3. Refuting the Polemic: Paul as “Corruptor” versus “Messenger”Modern Muslim polemicists, often unaware or dismissive of classical exegesis, assert that Paul corrupted the message of Jesus. However, the earliest and most authoritative Islamic sources held the opposite view:Paul isnamedandhonoredas a messenger of the Messiah.He is placed in the same category as Peter (Sham‘un) and John (Yuhanna), who are universally recognized as disciples of Jesus.The story is affirmed across multiple classical tafsir works and histories.This demonstrates a significant dissonance between early Islamic tradition and later polemical developments. Any assertion that Paul is absent or denigrated in Islamic sources is a distortion of the historical record.4. Archive and VerificationFor those who wish toverifythese claims, original sources are available:Tafsir Ibn Kathir Archive: See the section on Surah Ya-Sin, verses 13–17.QuranX Tafsir: English translation and commentary.Your attachedscreenshotprovides a faithful reproduction of the printed work, confirming this tradition for posterity.ConclusionThe evidence from the Qur’an, classical tafsir, and historical traditions unambiguously demonstrates that Paul (Bulus) is recognized as a legitimate messenger of Jesus in Islam’s earliest and most authoritative sources. Far from being a corrupter, Paul was understood to be amessenger of the Messiahto Antioch, working alongside Peter and John.This challenges both popular misconceptions within Islamic polemics and offers a basis for deeper interfaith dialogue. Scholars and students alike are encouraged to consult the primary sources and recognize the complex, interconnected legacy of Paul in the Abrahamic faiths.ReferencesTafsir Ibn Kathir, Surah Ya-Sin 36:13-17,QuranX.Tafsir al-Tabari20:500.Tafsir al-Qurtubi(on Surah Ya-Sin).Sahih Muslim, Book 30, Hadith 5836.Al-Tabari,Tārīkh al-Rusul wa’l-Mulūk.Ibn Ishaq, as cited in Ibn Kathir,al-Bidāya wa’l-Nihāya.Ibn Kathir Archive,Internet Archive.Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological Institute",

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThe traditional Islamic narrative asserts that Muhammad was “ummi”—often interpreted as “illiterate.” However, a careful reading of the Hadith and early Islamic sources presents a more nuanced and, at times, contradictory picture. This article critically examines the hadithic evidence concerning Muhammad’s literacy, evaluates the meaning of “ummi” in historical context, and addresses the theological implications of affirming Muhammad’s ability to read and write.IntroductionMuslim orthodoxy frequently holds that the Prophet Muhammad was illiterate, unable to read or write Arabic. This assertion, rooted in the term “ummi” as used in the Qur’an (Qur’an 7:157-158), is often cited as evidence of the miraculous nature of the Qur’an, believed to be revealed to an unlettered prophet. However, hadith literature and early Islamic historical sources provide compelling evidence challenging this claim. This article explores these sources, interrogating the theological and historical implications of Muhammad’s literacy.I. Linguistic and Contextual Analysis of “Ummi”The word “ummi” (أُمِّيٌّ) in Arabic traditionally translates as “illiterate” or “unlettered.” However, scholars such as W. Montgomery Watt and Alfred Guillaume have argued that “ummi” may refer to “gentile” (one who is not Jewish or Christian) or one not formally instructed in the scriptures, rather than simply illiterate (see Watt,Muhammad at Mecca, 1953).Qur’anic UsageThe Qur’an refers to Muhammad as “the unlettered prophet” (النَّبِيُّ الْأُمِّيُّ), but the same root is used in the Qur’an to describe “ummiyeen” (gentiles, or non-Jews) in 2:78. Thus, the term does not necessarily denote an inability to read and write.II. Hadithic Evidence: Muhammad’s Literacy1. Treaty of Hudaybiyyah: Writing His NameTheSahih al-Bukhari(2731; also see 3186, 4199, 4832) narrates that during the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah, Muhammad participated in the drafting of the document. When the Quraysh emissary objected to the title “Messenger of Allah,” Muhammad asked for the phrase to be erased. The narration in some versions states:“The Prophet took the document though he did not know how to write, and he wrote, ‘This is what Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, has agreed to.’”(Sahih Bukhari 3186, 4199, 4832; also Sahih Muslim 1784)Some narrations include, “The Prophet wrote,” and others clarify that he “asked Ali to write,” but the persistence of narrations where Muhammad himself “wrote” or made corrections is notable.2. Muhammad’s Signature and SealTheSahih al-Bukhari(4425) describes the Prophet’s use of a ring inscribed with “Muhammad Rasul Allah,” which he used as a seal for correspondence. InSahih Muslim(2092), it is stated:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) intended to write to the Persians, Romans, and Abyssinians. It was said, 'They will not accept any letter unless it is stamped with a seal.' So he took a silver ring and had (the words) Muhammad, Messenger of Allah engraved on it…”Here, the act of sending written letters is ascribed directly to Muhammad, with historical records indicating these letters were preserved and read by their recipients.3. The Incident at the DeathbedA famous episode inSahih al-Bukhari(114, 4431) recounts that as Muhammad lay dying, he asked for writing materials to record a statement:“Bring me a (pen and paper) so that I may write for you a statement after which you will not go astray.”This incident suggests familiarity with writing and the expectation that he could dictate or author documents.4. Hadith of Mu’awiyah bin Al-HakamSahih Muslim 537narrates a story of a slave girl, where Muhammad asks her, “Where is Allah?” and “Who am I?” Some versions of this hadith mention that Muhammad “wrote” (kataba) instructions or words, highlighting a potential for literacy.III. Early Islamic Historical AccountsIbn Ishaq’s SiraIbn Ishaq (d. 767 CE), in hisSirat Rasul Allah, narrates multiple occasions where the Prophet read, corrected, or dictated letters and contracts. There are also accounts of his business dealings in Mecca, which would have required basic literacy in record-keeping.IV. Theological ImplicationsMiraculousness of the Qur’anIf Muhammad could read and write, the apologetic argument that the Qur’an’s literary merit is miraculous due to his illiteracy is weakened. However, the miracle could then be ascribed to the substance and content of the revelation, not merely the mode.Integrity of TransmissionAcknowledging Muhammad’s literacy does not diminish the message but rather enhances the plausibility of accurate transmission of revelation, as the Prophet could oversee, review, and authenticate written documents.“Ummi” as GentileIf “ummi” means gentile rather than illiterate, then Qur’anic inerrancy is maintained, and the hadith evidence harmonizes with the historical context.V. Counterarguments and ReconciliationSome Muslim scholars argue that narrations suggesting Muhammad’s writing are metaphorical or refer to dictation. However, the prevalence and multiplicity of hadith mentioning his direct engagement with writing cannot be easily dismissed. The argument that Muhammad was initially illiterate but later learned to read and write is also present in some early tafsir (see al-Tabari, Tafsir al-Tabari, on Qur’an 29:48).ConclusionThe hadithic and historical evidence reveals that Muhammad’s relationship to literacy was more complex than traditional narratives suggest. Theological insistence on his illiteracy is not required by the evidence and may arise from later apologetic concerns. An honest reading of hadith and sira demonstrates occasions where Muhammad read, wrote, or corrected written materials. Reinterpreting “ummi” as “gentile” reconciles Qur’anic language with these traditions, suggesting that the Prophet Muhammad possessed at least functional literacy, a fact that aligns with his role as a statesman, leader, and communicator.ReferencesSahih al-Bukhari:Hadiths 2731, 3186, 4199, 4832, 114, 4431, 4425.Sahih Muslim:Hadiths 1784, 2092, 537.Ibn Ishaq,Sirat Rasul Allah, tr.

    "full_content": "A Scholarly and Theological CritiqueBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroduction: The Tenth Commandment in Biblical TheologyThe Tenth Commandment, as found in Exodus 20:17 and Deuteronomy 5:21, reads:“You shall not covet your neighbor’s house. You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, or his male or female servant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.”Coveting is fundamentally an issue of the heart—a desire for what rightfully belongs to another. This commandment is unique in its inward focus, emphasizing not just action but internal intent and desire. In Christian tradition, coveting is seen as the root of many outward sins, linking the Tenth Commandment to the spirit of all others.Islamic View: Desire, Possession, and Prophetic PrivilegeIslam, as taught in the Qur’an and Hadith, also warns against envy (hasad) and excessive worldly desire. However, the prophetic biography of Muhammad presents several narratives that raise important theological questions for interfaith dialogue. The core question is:Did Muhammad, as described in Islamic sources, transgress the heart and spirit of the Tenth Commandment?Debate Framework: Comparative AnalysisAffirmative Position: Evidence That Muhammad Broke the Tenth CommandmentThe Incident of Zayd and Zaynab (Qur’an 33:36-40)Biblical Parallels:The most direct challenge arises from Muhammad’s marriage to Zaynab bint Jahsh, formerly the wife of his adopted son, Zayd bin Harithah. Early Islamic sources (seeSahih al-Bukhari,Sahih Muslim,Tafsir Ibn Kathir) record that Muhammad saw Zaynab and was struck by her beauty. Subsequently, Zayd divorced her and Muhammad married her by divine command (Qur’an 33:37).Theological Critique:Critics argue this event exemplifies coveting another’s wife, violating the Tenth Commandment’s explicit prohibition. While Islam permits marriage after divorce, the sequence of admiration, divorce, and remarriage raises suspicion of covetous intent.Moral and Prophetic Example:In the Bible, King David’s coveting Bathsheba leads to condemnation and judgment (2 Samuel 11–12). Should not Muhammad, as the “Seal of the Prophets,” be held to the same moral standard?Prophetic Privileges and Possession (Qur’an 33:50)Sexual and Material Privileges:The Qur’an grants Muhammad unique privileges regarding women and property not afforded to other Muslims (Qur’an 33:50, 4:3; Hadith inSahih MuslimandSahih al-Bukhari). Critics claim these privileges reflect a desire for what others possess and institutionalize covetousness at the highest level.Envy or Divine Exception?Detractors argue that invoking divine sanction for personal benefit is a spiritual violation of the Tenth Commandment’s prohibition against covetousness.Spoils of War and Property (Qur’an 8:41; 59:6-7)Distribution of Spoils:Muhammad’s share of war spoils (fay’) is outlined in Qur’anic verses, often favoring the Prophet himself. Critics see this as further evidence of covetous acquisition, justified by revelation.Negative Position: Islamic Defense and ContextualizationIslamic Ethics on Desire and JusticeDistinction Between Desire and Action:Islamic jurisprudence distinguishes between fleeting desire (which is not blameworthy) and acting upon sinful covetousness. Defenders argue that Muhammad’s actions were governed by divine instruction, not personal greed.Marriage to Zaynab:Muslim scholars maintain that the marriage to Zaynab was divinely ordained to abrogate the Arab taboo against marrying an adopted son’s former wife, not driven by lust or covetousness. The Qur’an presents it as a legal reform, not personal desire (Qur’an 33:37).Prophetic Infallibility:Islamic theology posits the infallibility (ismah) of prophets, asserting that any act is by Allah’s will and beyond moral reproach by human standards.Differentiating Old Testament and Qur’anic LawNo Identical Prohibition:Some apologists assert that while the Qur’an warns against envy and injustice, it does not codify the Tenth Commandment as found in the Torah. Thus, Muhammad cannot be measured by Biblical standards alien to the Islamic worldview.Ethical Context:The socio-historical context of 7th-century Arabia differs from that of Israel under Moses. Actions taken by Muhammad must be understood within their historical and legal context.Critical Evaluation: Which Standard Applies?Universal Moral Law or Relative Ethics?The debate hinges on whether the Tenth Commandment represents a universal moral law binding on all true prophets, or whether prophetic actions are contextually exempt under new dispensations.The Problem of Prophetic Example:If Muhammad’s example contradicts the ethical standard given by previous prophets (such as Moses and Jesus), what does this say about his claim to be the final and greatest messenger?Spiritual Integrity:The commandment against coveting is ultimately about the alignment of the heart with God’s will. Did Muhammad, by his actions as preserved in Islamic tradition, demonstrate or contradict this standard?Conclusion: An Invitation to Further DialogueThis analysis, rooted in both scriptural comparison and historical critique, challenges the Islamic position on prophetic conduct and the integrity of Muhammad’s example regarding the Tenth Commandment. For Christians, the issue is not merely legalistic, but profoundly spiritual—centered on whether the prophetic heart reflects God’s character.Questions for Debate:Should Muhammad’s actions be judged by the ethical standards of the Ten Commandments?Do the incidents recorded in Islamic tradition constitute a breach of the Tenth Commandment?Is divine privilege a valid exemption from moral law, or does it expose a theological double standard?References:The Holy Bible: Exodus 20:17; Deuteronomy 5:21; 2 Samuel 11–12The Qur’an: 4:3, 8:41, 33:36-50, 59:6-7Sahih al-Bukhari,Sahih Muslim,Tafsir Ibn Kathir,Al-TabariJonathan A.C.

    "full_content": "A Theological and Scholarly CritiqueBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThe Eighth Commandment, found in Exodus 20:15, is a pillar of Judeo-Christian morality:“You shall not steal.”This commandment upholds the sanctity of private property, condemning theft in all its forms. The question arises: Did Muhammad, the founder of Islam, uphold this commandment, or do his actions and teachings—documented in Islamic sources—constitute a violation? This article explores this question in depth, inviting scholarly debate and comparative analysis.I. The Biblical Standard: The Eighth CommandmentThe commandment “You shall not steal” (Exodus 20:15; Deuteronomy 5:19) is unambiguous. In the Torah and throughout the Bible, theft is condemned, whether it is robbery, fraud, kidnapping (Exodus 21:16), or even withholding fair wages (Leviticus 19:13).Jesus affirmed this law(Matthew 19:18), and Paul warned: “Let the thief no longer steal, but rather let him labor, doing honest work with his own hands” (Ephesians 4:28). Property rights and respect for others' belongings are integral to biblical faith.II. Muhammad’s Actions in Light of the Eighth CommandmentA. Raids and Distribution of Spoils (Ghanima)Islamic historical sources describe Muhammad’s participation in caravan raids and battles, particularly after the Hijra to Medina.The Raid at Nakhla:Early Muslims, under Muhammad’s command, attacked a Meccan caravan during a sacred month, seizing goods and captives (Ibn Ishaq,Sirat Rasul Allah).The Battle of Badr and Distribution of Booty:After victory at Badr, Muhammad divided spoils among his followers and kept a portion for himself (Quran 8:1, 8:41;Sahih al-Bukhari 4273).Scholarly Debate:Defenders of Islamargue that these actions were not “theft” but acts of war, sanctioned by revelation, in the context of Arab tribal warfare.Critics and non-Muslim scholarsargue that, regardless of justification, seizing the property of others without consent constitutes theft by biblical and universal moral standards.B. Quranic Sanction for PlunderThe Quran addresses the question of spoils:“They ask you (O Muhammad) about the spoils of war. Say: The spoils are for Allah and the Messenger...” (Quran 8:1)“And know that whatever of war-booty that you may gain, verily one-fifth (1/5th) thereof is assigned to Allah, and to the Messenger...” (Quran 8:41)This institutionalizes the distribution of seized property. The Hadith further details how Muhammad allotted portions to his family and followers (Sahih Muslim 1758).C. The Case of FadakAfter the Jewish tribe of Banu Nadir was expelled from Medina, Muhammad took possession of their lands without battle (Sahih Muslim 1757). He also took the oasis of Fadak, which became his personal property.III. Theological Debate: Was This Stealing?A. The Islamic ViewMuslim theologians contend that:The context of war justifies seizure of enemy property.Actions sanctioned by “divine command” are not theft but legitimate spoils.The pre-Islamic Arabian context normalized raids.B. The Judeo-Christian and Universal Ethical PerspectiveThe commandment “You shall not steal” is absolute, not subject to context.Seizing property, land, or goods by force or without due process is theft, regardless of religious justification.Jesus and the apostles taught radical love for enemies, not plundering them (Matthew 5:44; Romans 12:17-21).C. Modern Scholarly AnalysisW. Montgomery Wattnotes, “The early Muslim raids, though justified in Islamic tradition, would be considered acts of brigandage by contemporary standards” (Muhammad at Medina, 1956).Alfred Guillaumehighlights the pragmatic and economic motivations behind the raids.IV. Case Study: The Execution of Banu Qurayza and Property SeizureAfter the execution of the Banu Qurayza, Muhammad and his followers divided the women, children, and property ([Ibn Ishaq,Sirat Rasul Allah];Sahih Bukhari 3043).Biblical Law:Condemns the unjust taking of property, even in war (Deuteronomy 20:10-15 sets standards for war but still expects mercy and restraint).Question:Can divine sanction be invoked for acts universally recognized as theft?V. Conclusion: A Call to Honest DebateDid Muhammad break the Eighth Commandment?Islamic tradition claims divine sanctionoverrides human law, but from the perspective of the Bible and universal ethics, the taking of property by force is theft.Christianity’s ethicforbids stealing, justifying violence or theft by divine right is rejected.Final Questions for Debate:Does divine command ever justify theft, or is the commandment absolute?Should morality be context-dependent or universal?If Muhammad is claimed to be a prophet in the biblical line, should his actions be held to the standard of the Ten Commandments?References:The Holy Bible (Exodus 20:15, Ephesians 4:28)The Quran (8:1, 8:41, 59:6-7)Sahih al-Bukhari, Sahih MuslimIbn Ishaq,Sirat Rasul AllahW.

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroduction: The Sixth Commandment in Judeo-Christian TraditionThe Sixth Commandment, as recorded in Exodus 20:13, is explicit:\"You shall not murder.\"This divine mandate stands as a cornerstone of Judeo-Christian ethics, emphasizing the sanctity and inviolability of human life. Jesus Christ, in affirming the Decalogue, reiterated the necessity of adhering to these commandments as a prerequisite for inheriting eternal life (see Matthew 19:16-19, Luke 18:18-20). When asked about attaining eternal life, Christ underscored,\"You shall not murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal...\"— making these commandments central principles of the Kingdom of God.Scholarly Investigation: Muhammad and the Violation of \"You Shall Not Murder\"This article examines, from a theological and historical perspective, how Muhammad—founder of Islam—stands in direct violation of the Sixth Commandment, not only by sanctioning but also by personally ordering acts of violence, murder, and brutality, including against the elderly and defenseless women.Case Studies from Islamic Sources1.The Killing of the Elderly: Umm QirfaAfter the conquest of the Kaaba, Muhammad dispatched his close companion, Zayd ibn Haritha, to suppress a tribe that had resisted conversion to Islam. Zayd’s forces attacked, capturing women and children, and specifically targeting the elderly:“We attacked them from all sides, fighting fiercely near their wells. We killed some of our enemies and took others captive. I saw a group fleeing, including women and children. I feared they would reach the mountain before me, so I shot an arrow, which landed in front of them, causing them to surrender. I herded them back like livestock.”(Sahih Muslim 4345)Among the captives wasUmm Qirfa, an elderly woman, who was executed in a gruesome manner. Zayd ibn Haritha ordered her execution by tying each of her legs to a camel and having the camels pulled in opposite directions, tearing her apart.(Ibn Ishaq/Hisham 980)Her daughter, Umm Qirfa Fatima, was taken as a captive and later gifted as a slave to Abu Bakr, then eventually claimed by Muhammad himself.(Sahih Muslim 4345)2.The Assassination of Abu Afak (Aged 120)Abu Afak, an elderly man (reportedly 120 years old), was killed for his poetry criticizing Muhammad’s actions in battle:Muhammad asked, “Who will deal with this rascal for me?” One of his followers volunteered and murdered Abu Afak in his sleep.(Ibn Ishaq/Hisham 995)3.The Killing of an Elderly MeccanAfter the conquest of Mecca, Muhammad reportedly ordered the execution of any non-Muslim who resisted Islam. TheSahih Bukharirecords:“The Prophet recited Surah Najm while lying down. The others did the same except for an old man who took a handful of earth and placed it on his head, saying, ‘This is enough for me.’ Later, I saw him killed as a disbeliever.”(Bukhari 19:173)Analysis: Theological and Ethical ImplicationsSuch actions, documented within respected Islamic sources, present a profound ethical and theological challenge. Unlike the teachings of Jesus—who rebuked violence and called for love even toward one’s enemies (Matthew 5:44)—Muhammad’s actions as chronicled in these incidents directly contradict the spirit and letter of the Sixth Commandment.The murder of non-combatants, the elderly, women, and critics—often in particularly brutal ways—cannot be harmonized with the commandment, “You shall not murder,” nor with the Christian moral tradition. Instead, these events expose a pattern wherein religious authority was used to justify acts that the biblical God, and Christ Himself, explicitly condemned.Further Scholarly ContextWhile some Muslim apologists attempt to contextualize or allegorize these events, the historicity of these incidents is affirmed in the earliest Islamic sources (Ibn Ishaq, Sahih Muslim, Sahih Bukhari). The consensus among historians and scholars of Islamic studies is that these acts were not only permitted but commanded by Muhammad, thus presenting a significant theological divergence from the ethics of the Decalogue.ConclusionIt is, therefore, evident that Muhammad, by both precept and example, violated the Sixth Commandment—\"You shall not murder\"—through his actions and directives involving the killing of the defenseless and elderly. This stands in stark contrast to the teachings and example of Jesus Christ and the foundational ethical code of the Judeo-Christian Scriptures.References:Exodus 20:13; Matthew 19:16-19; Luke 18:18-20Sahih Muslim 4345Ibn Ishaq/Hisham 980, 995Sahih Bukhari 19:173Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteFor Max Shimba Ministries Org ©2016.

    "full_content": "A Theological and Scholarly DebateBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThe Ten Commandments, central to the moral code of Judaism and Christianity, are considered by many as divine laws directly revealed by God to Moses on Mount Sinai. TheFourth Commandment, as found in Exodus 20:8, reads:“Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.” (Exodus 20:8, NKJV)This commandment was given not only as a religious ordinance but as an everlasting covenant (Exodus 31:16–17). It is a test of obedience and reverence towards God, with profound spiritual and communal implications.The Sabbath in the BibleThe Sabbath, observed from Friday sunset to Saturday sunset, is deeply rooted in the act of creation (Genesis 2:2–3) and reaffirmed in the Decalogue (Exodus 20:8–11; Deuteronomy 5:12–15). The Sabbath was intended as a day of rest, worship, and sanctification.Muhammad’s Stance on the SabbathThe Qur’an acknowledges the Sabbath:\"And you had already known about those who transgressed among you concerning the Sabbath, and We said to them, 'Be apes, despised.'\" (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:65, Sahih International)In this verse, Allah refers to a group among the Jews who violated the Sabbath, resulting in divine punishment. The Qur’an recognizes the sanctity of the Sabbathbutparadoxically, neither Muhammad nor his followers observed the Sabbath as a holy day. Instead, Islam institutedFriday (Jumu'ah)as the special day of communal prayer (Qur’an 62:9).The Shift from Sabbath to Jumu'ahIslamic tradition holds that the \"best day\" is Friday, not Saturday (Sahih Muslim 854). This deliberate move is not found in the Torah, the Prophets, nor the New Testament, where Jesus Himself kept the Sabbath (Luke 4:16).Debate Point:If the Sabbath was never abrogated in Scripture and was reinforced by the prophets and Jesus, what theological basis did Muhammad have to nullify its observance and replace it with Friday?Scholarly and Theological Critique1.Consistency with Divine LawBiblical Consistency:The Sabbath is a sign between God and His people \"forever\" (Exodus 31:16–17). Nowhere in the Bible does God authorize a change of the Sabbath.Islamic Inconsistency:While the Qur’an rebukes those who break the Sabbath, Muhammad himself neither observed nor commanded the keeping of the Sabbath, instead creating a new sacred day. This constitutes a break from the pattern established by Moses and observed by Jesus.2.Historical PerspectiveJewish Tradition:The Sabbath is a perpetual covenant (see also Ezekiel 20:12, 20).Christian Practice:While some branches of Christianity moved worship to Sunday, this was centuries after Christ and is a subject of considerable theological debate (seeBacchiocchi, S.,\"From Sabbath to Sunday\", 1977).Islamic Rejection:Islam claims to be a continuation of Abrahamic faith, yet rejects the Sabbath—central to Abrahamic law—demonstrating a rupture rather than continuity.3.Qur’anic Admission of the SabbathIslam’s own scriptures testify to the seriousness of breaking the Sabbath (Surah 4:154, Surah 7:163–166), recounting the story of the Jews who were transformed into apes for Sabbath violations. Yet, Muslims today do not rest or worship on Saturday, nor did Muhammad command them to do so.Contemporary Questions for MuslimsIf Allah considered Sabbath-breaking a grievous sin, why do Muslims not observe the Sabbath?On what authority did Muhammad change the designated day of worship from Saturday to Friday?Can Islam be considered a faithful continuation of the Mosaic law when it abrogates or alters one of the Ten Commandments?Scholarly ReferencesBacchiocchi, S.From Sabbath to Sunday: A Historical Investigation of the Rise of Sunday Observance in Early Christianity. Rome: Pontifical Gregorian University Press, 1977.Samuele Bacchiocchi,Divine Rest for Human Restlessness, Biblical Perspectives, 1998.The Holy Bible, Exodus 20:8–11; Deuteronomy 5:12–15; Ezekiel 20:12, 20; Luke 4:16.The Qur’an, Surah Al-Baqarah 2:65, Surah An-Nisa 4:154, Surah Al-A'raf 7:163–166, Surah Al-Jumu'ah 62:9.Hadith Collections:Sahih Muslim 854; Sahih Bukhari 893.ConclusionThe evidence indicates that Muhammad broke the Fourth Commandment by neither observing nor commanding the observance of the Sabbath,thereby contradicting the eternal law given by God in the Torah. While Islam claims reverence for previous prophets, this fundamental departure raises theological and scholarly challenges about Islam’s claim to continuity with the Abrahamic tradition.Final Debate ChallengeIs it possible for a prophet who claims to restore the true faith to disregard such a central command of God, or does this action mark a significant theological deviation? Scholars and students of comparative religion must honestly confront this question in the pursuit of truth.Shalom,Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

    "full_content": "A Scholarly Challenge to the Quran’s Claims in Light of Pre-Islamic Gospel EvidenceBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThe Qur’an makes several assertions about Jesus (ʿĪsā) that are not only absent from the canonical Gospels but, in many cases, contradict the historical and textual evidence available from pre-Islamic Christian sources. Qur’an 19:30 presents Jesus as speaking from the cradle, declaring, “Indeed, I am the servant of Allah.” This article invites a rigorous academic debate and challenges Muslim scholars, apologists, and theologians to provideverifiable, pre-Islamic, non-Quranic textual exhibitswhere Jesus refers to himself as the \"servant of Allah,\" calls Allah his \"Father,\" or in any way substantiates the specific Islamic claims about his identity and mission.1.Text of Qur’an 19:30 and Its Claim“He [Jesus] said: ‘Indeed, I am the servant of Allah. He has given me the Scripture and made me a prophet.’”(Qur’an 19:30, Sahih International)This verse ascribes to Jesus the explicit statement that he is the “servant (ʿabd) of Allah” (عبد الله), a theological construct central to Islamic Christology. The same surah continues to outline Islamic teachings about Jesus, none of which are present in the Gospel record.2.The Challenge: Where in the Gospel Did Jesus Ever Say This?A. Examining the Pre-Islamic Christian TextsCanonical Gospels:In all four Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John), Jesus never uses the phrase “I am the servant of Allah.”The New Testament Greek uses “theos” (God), and Jesus consistently refers to God as “Father”—not as “Allah.”No passage records Jesus speaking from the cradle or making prophetic pronouncements as an infant (a motif unique to later apocryphal traditions and the Qur’an).Non-Canonical Early Christian Writings (Before Islam):No extant Gospel or apostolic tradition pre-dating the Qur’an contains the phrase “Jesus is the servant of Allah,” or Jesus calling God “Allah.”Early apocryphal texts (e.g., Infancy Gospel of Thomas, Gospel of James) include legendary infancy narratives but never use Islamic terminology, nor do they present Jesus as the “servant of Allah.”B. On the Use of “Allah” as God’s Name in Christian ScriptureThe term “Allah” is the Arabic rendering of “God,” but its theological content in Islam is distinct from the Judeo-Christian understanding of God as “Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.”In the earliest Syriac and Aramaic Christian communities, God is called “Alaha” (ܐܠܗܐ) or “Elohim” (אֱלֹהִים) but never “Allah” in the precise Qur’anic sense.C. Jesus’ Own Words About His Relationship with GodJesus refers to God as “Father” over 165 times in the New Testament (see John 5:17-18, Matthew 6:9, Mark 14:36).Jesus says, “I and the Father are one” (John 10:30).Jesus never says, “I am the servant of Allah.”Nowhere does Jesus refer to “Allah” as his Father.D. Historical and Linguistic IncongruitiesThe Quran’s retroactive ascription of Islamic terminology and concepts to Jesus is anachronistic, as the word “Allah” was not used in first-century Palestine by Jews or Christians in the way it is employed in Islam.The Gospels are rooted in a Jewish monotheistic context that used “Abba” (Father) and “YHWH” (the LORD), not “Allah.”3.Qur’an as an Ahistorical Rewriting? A Call for Muslim ExhibitsA. Challenge to Islamic ApologeticsIf the Qur’an is truly a continuation of prior revelation, there must bepre-Islamic, extra-Qur’anic, textual exhibitswhere Jesus explicitly makes these claims.Where is the evidence from any manuscript, papyrus, parchment, or Christian oral tradition prior to the 7th century that Jesus declared himself “the servant of Allah” or called Allah his Father?B. Review of Early Christian WritingsPatristic Writings:Church Fathers such as Ignatius, Polycarp, Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, and Tertullian, who were closest in time to Jesus and the apostles, never mention such words attributed to Jesus.Jewish Historical Records:Josephus and other first-century Jewish historians do not record Jesus making such declarations.Roman Sources:No Roman or Greek historian prior to Islam attributes to Jesus a servant relationship to Allah.4.Analysis: Are the Quranic Claims Fabricated?A. Fabrication or Borrowed Legends?The assertion that Jesus spoke as an infant is found only in late, non-canonical apocryphal texts (e.g., Arabic Infancy Gospel, written centuries after Christ and likely after the rise of Islam).The Qur’an’s depiction of Jesus often mirrors and sometimes modifies these legendary sources, which lack apostolic authority and were never recognized by mainstream Christianity.B. Theological ImplicationsInvented Testimony:If the Qur’an cannot produce a single pre-Islamic exhibit for its claims about Jesus, then it stands as a book promoting narratives unsupported by historical evidence.Contradiction of the Gospel Record:The core Christian confession about Jesus’ identity (as Son, not merely servant) is not only different but irreconcilable with the Islamic claim.5.Conclusion and Debate: The Qur’an as a False Doctrine Promoting InventionsA. SummaryNo pre-Islamic Gospel, canonical or apocryphal, records Jesus as the “servant of Allah.”No manuscript or oral tradition predating the Qur’an calls Allah the Father of Jesus, nor does Jesus call God “Allah.”The claims in Qur’an 19:30 and related verses have no historical, textual, or theological precedent outside of the Qur’an itself.B. The Scholarly ChallengeWe challenge Muslim apologists and scholars to produce:Any documented Gospel or historical Christian source written before the birth of Muhammad, containing Jesus’ own declaration as the “servant of Allah.”Any pre-Islamic Christian record of Jesus referring to Allah as his Father.Any verifiable, objective exhibit that supports the Qur’an’s claims about Jesus outside of Islamic scripture.If such evidence cannot be produced, it is intellectually honest and academically necessary to conclude:The Qur’an has fabricated claims about Jesus that are not rooted in history.Islamic Christology is built on retroactive invention, not revelation.Therefore, the Qur’an must be critically examined and exposed as a doctrine that promotes legends as truth, without verified historical evidence.ReferencesThe Holy Bible, New Testament (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John)Infancy Gospel of Thomas; Protoevangelium of James (non-canonical)Early Church Fathers: Ignatius, Polycarp, Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, TertullianJosephus, Antiquities of the JewsBruce, F.F.,The Canon of Scripture.Reynolds, Gabriel Said,The Qur’an and Its Biblical Subtext.Cragg, Kenneth,Jesus and the Muslim: An Exploration.By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteThis article is an open invitation to academic debate.

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThe phrase “weeping and gnashing of teeth” appears multiple times in the New Testament as a vivid warning from Jesus Christ Himself regarding the eternal fate of those who reject Him. While Muslims honor Jesus (Isa) as a prophet, Islam categorically denies His divine Sonship, atonement, and saving Lordship. This article challenges Muslims, in the spirit of academic and theological inquiry, to reconsider the claims of Jesus Christ in light of both biblical testimony and eschatological warnings, for the sake of their own eternal destiny.I. The Biblical Concept: Weeping and Gnashing of TeethIn the Gospels, Jesus repeatedly warns of a place or condition where there will be “weeping and gnashing of teeth” (Greek:klauthmos kai brugmos tōn odontōn) for those cast out of God’s kingdom:Matthew 8:12: “But the sons of the kingdom will be cast out into outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”Matthew 13:41-42: “The Son of Man will send out His angels… and will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.”Matthew 22:13;24:51;25:30: Similar warnings are repeated in parables and eschatological discourse.Luke 13:28: “There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, and yourselves thrust out.”The imagery is of deep regret, conscious torment, and exclusion from the presence and blessings of God. Theologically, it signifies the final judgment upon all who refuse to acknowledge and confess Christ as Lord (cf.Romans 10:9-10; John 14:6).II. Islamic Denial of Jesus’ Sonship and the ConsequenceThe Qur’an explicitly denies that Jesus is the Son of God (Qur’an 4:171; 5:72, 116), calling it “blasphemy” and equating it with shirk (associating partners with Allah). Yet, the Bible proclaims:“Whoever denies the Son does not have the Father either; he who acknowledges the Son has the Father also.” (1 John 2:23)“Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God.” (1 John 4:15)By refusing to confess Jesus’ divine Sonship, Muslims (and all others who deny Him) remain outside the covenant of salvation. The stark warning of Jesus is thus highly relevant:Unbelief leads to outer darkness, to “weeping and gnashing of teeth.”III. The Reality of Judgment and JehannamThe biblical concept of “weeping and gnashing of teeth” parallels the Islamic notion of Jahannam (Hell), described in the Qur’an as a place of fire, regret, and eternal punishment (Qur’an 2:206; 3:191; 39:16; 67:6-11). However, thekey differenceis the means of escape:In the Bible, salvation is by faith in Christ(cf.John 3:16-18).A. Jesus’ Exclusive Claim“I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.” (John 14:6)“Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.” (Acts 4:12)These words are exclusive and final. No prophet, ritual, or law can substitute for the redemptive work of Christ.B. The Universal CallJesus calls all, including Muslims, to come to Him:“Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.” (Matthew 11:28)The offer is open, but the warning is also clear: rejection brings everlasting regret and separation.IV. A Theological Challenge to Muslims: Re-Examine Your BeliefsHonest Inquiry: The Qur’an itself encourages seeking the truth and consulting the “People of the Book” (Qur’an 10:94; 5:47). Are you willing to examine the Gospels and the testimony of Jesus Himself?Historical Testimony: The New Testament, written within a generation of Jesus’ ministry, affirms His crucifixion, resurrection, and divinity—facts acknowledged by secular historians (Tacitus, Josephus) and early Christian martyrs.Salvation’s Assurance: Islam offers no assurance of forgiveness; the Bible offers full pardon and eternal life to all who confess Jesus as Lord and believe in their heart God raised Him from the dead (Romans 10:9-13).V. Invitation: Accept Jesus and Escape the Coming JudgmentThe warnings of “weeping and gnashing of teeth” are not mere metaphors, but solemn declarations from the mouth of Christ. For Muslims and all who have not yet confessed Jesus as the Son of God, the time for repentance is now.Dear Muslim reader, examine the evidence, seek the truth, and consider Jesus’ words:“He who believes in the Son has everlasting life; and he who does not believe the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.” (John 3:36)Confess Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior. Escape the destiny of regret and outer darkness. Enter into the joy, peace, and light of God’s Kingdom.ReferencesThe Holy Bible, New King James Version (NKJV)The Qur’an, translations by Yusuf Ali and Saheeh InternationalF.F.

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThe conventional Islamic narrative claims that Prophet Muhammad was “ummi,” usually translated as “illiterate.” This dogma undergirds much of the apologetic argument for the Qur’an’s miraculous nature, positing that an illiterate man could not have produced such a text unaided. However, a closer examination of canonical hadith literature challenges this assertion. Multiple authentic narrations—ranging from the famous deathbed incident to reported actions involving reading and writing—suggest that Muhammad possessed at least a basic proficiency in literacy. This article presents the evidence, explores the theological implications, and questions the motives for modern Muslim apologetic evasions of these sources.I. Introduction: The Myth of Muhammad’s IlliteracyMuslim tradition asserts the Prophet Muhammad could neither read nor write, citing the Qur’anic epithet “al-ummi” (الأمي). However, a thorough and honest reading of the hadith corpus exposes a more nuanced reality. Several narrations, considered authentic by major Islamic authorities, demonstrate both his ability to write and to command the written word. This article will analyze these hadiths and pose a theological challenge to the continued perpetuation of the illiteracy claim.II. Primary Hadith Evidence of Muhammad’s LiteracyA. The Deathbed Incident (Sahih al-Bukhari 114, 4431)One of the most explicit and frequently cited proofs of Muhammad’s literacy occurs during his final illness. Sahih al-Bukhari records:Narrated Ibn ‘Abbas:\"When the Prophet was on his deathbed and in the house there were men among whom was 'Umar ibn al-Khattab, the Prophet said, 'Come, let me write (أكتب / aktub) for you a statement after which you will not go astray.'\"(Sahih al-Bukhari, 114; also see 4431)The verb “aktub” here unambiguously means “to write.” The Prophet’s request for pen and paper implies he could physically write, not merely dictate. If he were genuinely illiterate, such a request would be absurd.B. The Slave Girl and Writing in Sahih Muslim (537)The narration of Mu’awiyah bin Al-Hakam involves a slave girl questioned by Muhammad:The Prophet asked her, “Where is Allah?” and “Who am I?” Some versions note that the Prophet “wrote” (kataba) instructions or words—again, directly associating Muhammad with the act of writing.(See Sahih Muslim 537; variant readings and commentaries)C. Muhammad’s Treaties and LettersMultiple hadith and early Islamic sources report that Muhammad sent written letters to the kings and rulers of his era, with his own seal. For example, Sahih al-Bukhari (Hadith 2938, 4424) reports:“The Prophet wrote (kataba) a letter to Caesar...”The consistent use of the verb \"kataba\"—meaning “wrote” rather than “dictated”—is linguistically significant. Even if scribes were involved, the Prophet’s engagement with writing and written correspondence demonstrates at minimum a familiarity with written language.D. The Treaty of HudaybiyyahSahih al-Bukhari 2731, 3183, 4195, and Muslim 1784 recount Muhammad's role in the writing of the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah. In some reports, the Prophet corrects scribes and is involved in editing the text, indicating at least some functional literacy.\"Take it out, erase it, and write: ‘This is what Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, has agreed with...’\"(Sahih al-Bukhari, 2731)III. Theological Debate: Why Elude the Evidence?If the Prophet could read and write, why has the doctrine of his illiteracy become so essential in Islam? Several theological motivations can be identified:To Bolster the Qur’an’s Miraculous Status:The doctrine claims the Qur’an’s literary excellence is impossible from an unlettered man, thereby proving divine origin.To Fulfill Misinterpreted Prophecies:Some claim “al-ummi” refers to a prophet foretold in the Torah as “the unlettered prophet.”To Shield from Christian and Jewish Critique:By portraying Muhammad as illiterate, apologists avoid accusations of scriptural borrowing from the Bible and Jewish texts.Yet the hadith evidence itself is undeniable and canonical. If Muslims trust the hadith for doctrine and law, why evade or reinterpret those that contradict a convenient narrative? Is faith so fragile that it must reject its own traditions to maintain apologetic coherence?IV. Additional Hadith and Historical EvidenceBeyond the above, further sources underscore Muhammad’s engagement with reading and writing:Signing and Stamping Documents:Muhammad’s personal seal was affixed to letters; reports indicate he supervised or sometimes wrote himself (see Ibn Sa’d, “Tabaqat,” and other sira literature).Reading Jewish Scriptures:Several traditions mention Muhammad reading or examining written documents from Jews and Christians, sometimes calling for them to bring their scriptures (see Sunan Abu Dawud 4449).V. Conclusion: The Call for Intellectual HonestyThe evidence from sahih hadith and early Islamic tradition compels us to admit the strong likelihood that Muhammad possessed at least basic literacy. The continued denial of this fact—despite authentic narrations—is a distortion of Islamic history for apologetic purposes. If faith is based on truth, then the tradition must confront its own sources with honesty.Questions for Muslim Apologists:Why are these explicit hadiths elided or explained away in modern discourse?If the Prophet could write, what is lost for Islamic faith? Or is the fear that such admission would undermine cherished dogma?Should not the true mark of faith be the courage to follow the evidence, even when it challenges tradition?ReferencesSahih al-Bukhari 114, 4431, 2731, 3183, 4195Sahih Muslim 537Sahih al-Bukhari 2938, 4424Sunan Abu Dawud 4449Ibn Sa’d, “Tabaqat al-Kubra”Other canonical hadith and early Islamic historiographyBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteFor theological inquiry and critical engagement with Islamic tradition.",

However, the Prophet of Islam—Muhammad—never once spoke to God. This fundamental difference raises a pressing question: if Muhammad never conversed with the One who allegedly sent him, how can his claim to prophethood be trusted?Let us consider the biblical standard for a prophet:Prophets Who Spoke Directly With GodMoses–“God called to him from within the bush, ‘Moses! Moses!’”(Exodus 3:1-21)Elijah– Engaged in conversation with God repeatedly (1 Kings 19, entire chapter).Jeremiah–“Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you...”(Jeremiah 1:5)Jonah–“The word of the Lord came to Jonah a second time...”(Jonah 3:2)Paul– The Lord Jesus appeared and spoke to Paul (Acts 18:9); Paul affirms his apostleship as being “sent, not from men nor by a man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead” (Galatians 1:1).Scripture is clear: every biblical prophet had direct, personal encounters with God. Paul himself was chosen, called, and sent by God—not by a mere intermediary.Romans 1:1– “Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle and set apart for the gospel of God.”Contrast this with Muhammad, who—according to Islamic sources—received his messages not from God Himself, but through the angel Jibril (Gabriel). Even the Qur’an and Hadith literature admit: Muhammad never met or spoke with Allah directly.The Disturbing Origins of Muhammad's “Prophethood”Let us examine Muhammad’s background as recorded in Islamic sources:1. His Birth and Early LifeAccording to Abu Huraira, “The Prophet Muhammad was accompanied by a devil since birth” (Fat’hul Baary, Vol. 6, p. 389). Is there any evidence that this demon was cast out? If so, Muslims should present it.2. His First “Revelation” in the CaveWhen Muhammad first received his “call” in the cave, he was seized with terror and ran to his wife, Khadija, confessing he feared for his mind and sanity, and that he was being afflicted by evil spirits (SeeThe Life of Prophet Muhammadby Sheikh A. Farsy, p. 17).Questions:If Gabriel came from Allah, why did Muhammad believe he was tormented by demons after this encounter?Why did Muhammad confess that Gabriel confused and disturbed his mind?3. His Experience with SorceryMuhammad’s wife Aisha narrated that a Jewish man named Labiid bin Al’answan cast a spell on Muhammad, causing him to hallucinate and behave irrationally (Sahih Muslim, Vol. 4, pp. 38-39).Questions:Can a true prophet of God be bewitched and lose control of his faculties?Where was Allah when Muhammad was bewitched?Where is the record of deliverance from this spell?The Unique and Problematic Nature of Muhammad’s ProphethoodIs it reasonable to believe that God, the Sovereign Creator, would appoint a messenger whose life was so entangled with demonic oppression, confusion, and sorcery? No biblical prophet ever displayed such characteristics or confessed such experiences.Key Differences:Muhammad never spoke directly to the God who supposedly sent him.He was accompanied by a demon from birth (according to Hadith).He confessed to being afflicted by demons at the onset of his prophethood.He admitted to being mentally disturbed and manipulated by spirits.He acknowledged being bewitched and incapacitated by sorcery.If any prophet or apostle in the Torah, Psalms, or Gospel exhibited such disturbing traits, let Muslims produce the evidence. None exists.Conclusion: Only Jesus is the True WayDear reader, Muhammad does not qualify as a true prophet of God according to biblical standards. I invite you to turn to Jesus Christ, the only Way, the Truth, and the Life—the only one through whom we can truly approach the living God.Shimba Theological InstituteDr. Maxwell ShimbaMax Shimba MinistriesFeel free to use or adapt this post for your theological blog or publications.",

While many Muslims today reject Paul’s apostleship, claiming he was a false teacher and not a true messenger, this perspective is both theologically and historically uninformed. By examining the Scriptures—both the Bible and the Qur’an—as well as classical Islamic scholarship and the hadith, we can gain a deeper understanding of Paul’s divine mission.How Do Messengers Receive Revelation?We begin with the foundational understanding of how prophets and apostles receive divine revelation. InNumbers 12:6, the Almighty declares the nature of prophetic communication. Was Paul among those who received revelation in such a manner?Acts 16:9tells us, \"During the night Paul had a vision...\" Clearly, Paul was a recipient of divine visions, aligning with the criteria for messengers outlined in the Hebrew Scriptures.To Whom Was Paul Sent?God explicitly states Paul's commission inActs 9:15:\"But the Lord said to Ananias, 'Go! This man is my chosen instrument to proclaim my name to the Gentiles and their kings and to the people of Israel.'\"Further confirmation is found inActs 13:2:\"While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, 'Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.'\"Paul himself affirms his apostleship inGalatians 1:1:\"Paul, an apostle—sent not from men nor by a man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead.\"And again inColossians 1:1:\"Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother.\"Here, Paul stands firm, not as a self-appointed leader, but as one commissioned directly by Christ and God Himself.The Requirement of Faith in All MessengersIslamic faith, as summarized in the classical creed (Swifat ul I’iman Mufaswalu), is built on six articles:Belief in AllahBelief in His AngelsBelief in His BooksBelief in His MessengersBelief in Divine DestinyBelief in the Last DayOur focus is on the fourth article: faith in the messengers. Islam teaches there have been approximately 124,000 prophets, but only 25 are explicitly mentioned in the Qur’an.Surah 4:164states:\"Of some messengers We have already told you the story; of others We have not—and to Moses Allah spoke directly.\"Surah 2:136likewise commands:\"Say: 'We believe in Allah and what has been sent down to us and what was sent down to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the descendants, and what was given to Moses and Jesus, and what was given to the prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and to Him we submit.'\"Paul himself, as he testifies inPhilippians 3:5, was an Israelite of the tribe of Benjamin—a direct descendant of Jacob (Ya’qub). Therefore, the Qur’an implicitly includes Paul among those whom Muslims are called to respect as a true messenger.The Testimony of the Qur’an and the Early Muslim ScholarsIt is crucial to recognize that the rejection of Paul as an apostle is a recent development in Islamic polemics. InSurah 36:13-14 (Ya-Sin), we read:\"And set forth to them the parable of the people of the city, when the messengers came to it. When We sent to them two messengers, but they denied them both, so We strengthened them with a third; and they said, 'Indeed, we have been sent to you as messengers.'\"Many respected Qur’anic commentators, such as Sheikh Balwani and Yusuf Ali, identify this city asAntiochand name the three messengers as John, Simon, and Paul (Yuhanna, Shim‘on, and Boulos). Ibn Kathir, a renowned Islamic scholar, affirms in his tafsir (Qur’anic commentary) that these messengers, including Paul, were sent to the people of Antioch.Additionally, in Ibn Hisham’s biography of the Prophet Muhammad (Sirat Nabawiya, vol. 4, p. 140), the Prophet is recorded as listing Paul among the apostles of Jesus, specifically sent to the Romans.The Qur’an’s Directive for GuidanceWhen Muslims have doubts regarding matters not explicitly detailed in the Qur’an, they are instructed inSurah 10:94:\"So if you are in doubt about that which We have revealed to you, then ask those who have been reading the Scripture before you...\"Thus, the Qur’an itself encourages Muslims to consult the People of the Book—Jews and Christians—about the prophets, most of whom are found in the Bible.Conclusion: Rejecting Paul is Rejecting the FaithRejecting Paul’s apostleship is not only a departure from biblical revelation but also from the plain teachings of the Qur’an and classical Islamic scholarship. To oppose Paul is to oppose the faith itself and, ultimately, to challenge the wisdom of God. Satan uses subtle snares to divert believers from the truth. Instead of following contemporary polemics, we are called to heed the testimony of Scripture, the guidance of the Qur’an, and the consensus of early Muslim scholars.Shalom.This theological reflection affirms that both the Bible and the Qur’an, along with the earliest Islamic scholars, recognize the apostleship of Paul. Contemporary opposition is a modern innovation, not rooted in sacred Scripture or tradition.",

Abstaining from pork and unclean foods was commanded for all Israelites long before Islam existed.Key Point:Jesus followed Jewish kosher laws, not Islamic halal laws. Kosher pre-dates halal by over a millennium.Furthermore, in Mark 7:18-19, Jesus began to reveal that it is not food but what comes from the heart that defiles a person. This shift is entirely non-Islamic.(2)Was Jesus Circumcised According to Islamic Custom?Muslim Claim:Muslims highlight that Jesus was circumcised, a practice also found in Islam.Biblical Truth:Jesus was circumcised on the eighth day (Luke 2:21), in fulfillment of the covenant God made with Abraham (Genesis 17:10-12), as all Jewish males were.Key Point:Circumcision is a sign of the Abrahamic covenant, not a marker of Islam. It is foundational to Jewish identity and predates Islam by two thousand years.(3)Is “Messiah” Just Another Term for Prophet in Islam?Muslim Claim:Islam acknowledges Jesus (Isa) as al-Masih (the Messiah), but only as a prophet, not the divine Son of God.Scriptural Reality:In the Bible, “Messiah” (Hebrew:Mashiach, Greek:Christos) means “Anointed One,” and refers to the Savior promised to Israel, not merely a prophet.Key Point:Jesus fulfilled specific Messianic prophecies (see Isaiah 9:6, Micah 5:2, Daniel 9:25-26).The New Testament presents Jesus as Son of God and Redeemer, not just a messenger (see John 1:1-14, John 20:31).The Quranic “Isa” is fundamentally different from the Jesus of the Bible, stripped of His divinity, atoning death, and resurrection.Accepting Jesus only as a prophet is to deny His true identity and mission.Summary and Final ThoughtsJesus’dietary practicesandcircumcisionwere thoroughly Jewish, rooted in the Torah, not in later Islamic law.Thetitle “Messiah”is deeply Messianic and redemptive in the Bible—far beyond the Islamic concept of a prophet.Islamic attempts to appropriate Jesusrely on retroactive claims and redefinitions that strip Him of His biblical identity and mission.Jesus is the Messiah, Son of God, and Savior—not a Muslim prophet.Shalom,Dr Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

    "full_content": "THE ISLAMIC DILEMMA: A THEOLOGICAL AND HISTORICAL ANALYSISBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThe interplay between the Qur’an and the Gospels presents a significant theological conundrum within Islam, often referred to as the “Islamic Dilemma.” This dilemma centers on the Qur’an’s affirmation of the previous Scriptures—specifically the Gospel (Injil)—and its subsequent contradictions with the actual teachings found within those Scriptures. This article critically examines the dilemma, referencing Islamic texts, Christian scriptures, and scholarly interpretations to demonstrate the theological and logical inconsistencies inherent in Islamic claims regarding the integrity and authority of the Gospels. The analysis further exposes the resultant predicament for Muhammad and Islamic doctrine.1. IntroductionIslamic theology claims continuity with the Abrahamic tradition, asserting that Allah revealed the Torah to Moses, the Psalms to David, the Gospel to Jesus, and the Qur’an to Muhammad. This claim, however, is fraught with contradictions when the actual content of the Gospels is compared with Islamic doctrine. The \"Islamic Dilemma\" emerges from the Qur’an's simultaneous affirmation and rejection of the foundational Christian claims about Jesus Christ.2. The Qur’an’s Affirmation of the GospelThe Qur’an repeatedly affirms that the Gospel was revealed by Allah as a source of guidance and light:Surah 3:3:“He has sent down upon you, [O Muhammad], the Book in truth, confirming what was before it. And He revealed the Torah and the Gospel.”Surah 5:46:“And We sent, following in their footsteps, Jesus, the son of Mary, confirming that which came before him in the Torah; and We gave him the Gospel, in which was guidance and light and confirming that which preceded it of the Torah as guidance and instruction for the righteous.”Surah 5:47:“So let the people of the Gospel judge by what Allah has revealed therein.”Here, the Qur’an not only recognizes the Gospel as divinely inspired but commands Christians to judge by it, suggesting the Gospel’s continued validity during Muhammad’s era.3. The Contradictions: Christology in the Gospels vs. the Qur’an3.1. Jesus in the GospelsThe Gospels emphatically declare the divinity and sonship of Jesus Christ:John 8:58:“Before Abraham was, I am.”Mark 3:11:“Whenever the impure spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, ‘You are the Son of God.’”John 1:1, 14:“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God… The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us.”3.2. Jesus in the Qur’anIslam categorically denies the divinity and sonship of Christ:Surah 4:171:“The Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, was no more than a messenger of Allah... So believe in Allah and His messengers, and do not say ‘Three’; desist—it is better for you. Allah is only one God. Far be it from His glory that He should have a son.”Surah 5:72:“They have certainly disbelieved who say, ‘Allah is the Messiah, the son of Mary’… Allah has forbidden him Paradise, and his refuge is the Fire.”Thus, while the Gospel proclaims Jesus as God and the Son of God, the Qur’an rejects these central Christian tenets. This irreconcilable contradiction is at the heart of the Islamic dilemma.4. The Islamic Response: Corruption TheoryFacing this contradiction, Muslim apologists typically assert that the Gospels have been corrupted (tahrif). Yet, the Qur’an explicitly states:Surah 6:115:“And the word of your Lord has been fulfilled in truth and in justice. None can change His words...”Surah 18:27:“And recite what has been revealed to you of the Book of your Lord. None can change His words…”If, according to the Qur’an, none can alter the words of Allah, it becomes theologically incoherent to argue that the Gospel—which the Qur’an recognizes as Allah’s Word—has been corrupted.Furthermore, the Qur’an challenges the Jews and Christians to judge by their own scriptures (Surah 5:47, 5:68), implying the continued authenticity of these texts during Muhammad’s time.Manuscript EvidenceModern textual criticism reveals that the manuscripts of the Gospels predate Muhammad by centuries, and there is no evidence of a widespread post-Christian corruption. The content Christians had in the 7th century is virtually identical to what exists today. (See Bruce Metzger,The Text of the New Testament, and F.F. Bruce,The Canon of Scripture.)5. The Lost Gospel ArgumentSome Muslims contend that the original Gospel was lost. However, the Qur’an itself contradicts this notion by referencing the Gospel in the possession of Christians at the time of Muhammad, commanding them to judge by it:Surah 5:47:“So let the people of the Gospel judge by what Allah has revealed therein.”This passage presupposes the accessibility and authenticity of the Gospel among the Christian communities of the 7th century.6. The Muhammad Dilemma: The Prophet’s Reliance on the GospelMuhammad’s references to the Gospel and his affirmation of its authority raise serious theological dilemmas. If the Gospel was corrupted or lost, then Muhammad’s command to Christians to follow it becomes either ignorant or deceptive—attributes inconsistent with prophethood. If the Gospel was intact and true, then Islam’s denial of its central message (Christ’s divinity, crucifixion, and resurrection) renders Islam a self-contradictory faith.7. Logical Flow of the DilemmaIf the Gospels are true:Islam is false, because its core claims contradict the Gospel (e.g., Christ’s divinity and atonement).If the Gospels are false:The Qur’an is false, because it affirms the Gospels as revelation.If the Gospels are corrupted:The Qur’an is false, because it teaches no one can change Allah’s words.If the Gospels are lost:The Qur’an is false, because Muhammad affirmed the existence and validity of the Gospel among Christians of his time.Either way, Islam cannot stand without undermining its own foundational claims.8. Conclusion: The Inescapable DilemmaThe so-called “Islamic Dilemma” is an unavoidable theological predicament for Islam and for Muhammad as its prophet. If the Qur’an is to be believed, the Gospels were once the Word of God, but their content irreconcilably contradicts Islamic doctrine. The standard Muslim response—the corruption theory—lacks Qur’anic support and is refuted by manuscript evidence. The only resolution for Muslims is to reject either the integrity of their own scripture or the legitimacy of Christian claims, but not both.The academic and theological challenge is clear: Islam cannot both affirm and deny the Gospel. Any attempt to reconcile the two results in internal contradiction, exposing the dilemma of Muhammad’s teaching and, by extension, the doctrinal integrity of Islam itself.ReferencesThe Qur’an: Surahs 3:3, 4:171, 5:46-47, 5:68, 6:115, 18:27The Bible: John 1:1, 1:14, 8:58, Mark 3:11Metzger, B.

Yale University Press.Sahih Muslim, Book 1, Hadith 367 (affirming Gospel as revelation).For further study, students are encouraged to examine primary source manuscripts, the history of textual transmission, and patristic references to the Gospel predating Islam. The tension between the Qur’an’s recognition of the Gospel and its rejection of Christian doctrine remains a profound theological and historical challenge for Islamic apologetics.By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

Such a report is not merely a matter of historical curiosity; it stands as a profound theological concern that raises serious questions about Muhammad’s claim to prophethood and his representation of the Almighty God.Translation of the Original StatementThe honorable Prophet (s.a.w.w.) set his eyes upon and lusted after another man’s wife (a married woman) (Na’uzubillah—God forbid). [Tafsir Fath al-Qadir, Volume 4, page 404]Theological Expansion and CritiqueThe behavior attributed to Muhammad in this account starkly contrasts with the character of God as revealed in the Scriptures. The God of the Bible is holy, just, and pure—He abhors covetousness, adultery, and every form of moral compromise. The Ten Commandments explicitly state: “You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife” (Exodus 20:17). Jesus further deepens this ethic by teaching, “Anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart” (Matthew 5:28).How then can a true prophet of the Almighty, one who claims to represent the will and character of the living God, act in direct contradiction to the most basic moral standards set by God Himself? The prophets of the Bible, though human and fallible, were called to a higher standard of holiness, serving as exemplars of God’s righteousness to His people. The very office of a prophet demands integrity, self-control, and an unwavering commitment to the commands of God.This account of Muhammad not only exposes a serious moral flaw but also undermines his prophetic credentials. It suggests that Muhammad’s behavior was guided by personal desire rather than by the Spirit of the Most High. Such conduct cannot be reconciled with the nature of God, who is described as “of purer eyes than to behold evil and cannot look on wickedness” (Habakkuk 1:13).Furthermore, this episode stands in stark contrast to the character of Jesus Christ, who not only resisted temptation but also taught and modeled the highest standards of sexual purity and sacrificial love. Jesus never desired what belonged to another, nor did He seek to gratify His flesh at the expense of God’s commandments. His life was the perfect reflection of the holiness of God, making Him the true and ultimate Prophet, Priest, and King.ConclusionThe incident of Muhammad coveting another man’s wife, as preserved in Islamic sources, is not a trivial matter. It is one of many evidences that Muhammad’s life and teachings do not reflect the holiness, love, and justice of the Almighty God. Rather, it exposes him as a man led by personal passions, and thus, by biblical standards, a false prophet. As Christians, we are called to discern the true from the false by examining the fruit and character of those who claim to speak for God (Matthew 7:15-20; 1 John 4:1).For this reason, Muhammad cannot be regarded as a true messenger of the Most High, for his actions fail to manifest the unblemished holiness and righteousness that are the very essence of the Almighty.References:Tafsir Fath al-Qadir, Volume 4, p. 404Exodus 20:17Matthew 5:28Habakkuk 1:13Matthew 7:15-201 John 4:1If you want this adapted for other uses (infographic, debate, or a book chapter), let me know!",

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis article explores the biblical Second Commandment in relation to Islamic ritual and tradition as established by Muhammad. By engaging biblical, Qur’anic, and Hadith sources, as well as critical academic scholarship, the discussion seeks to demonstrate that several core Islamic rituals represent a continuity of pre-Islamic idolatrous practice, thereby constituting a violation of the Second Commandment from a Judeo-Christian theological perspective. This analysis is contextualized within the history of religions and comparative theology.IntroductionThe Second Commandment, which prohibits the making and veneration of images or physical objects in worship (Exodus 20:4-5; Deuteronomy 5:8-9), is fundamental to biblical monotheism. The command is clear and categorical:\"You shall not make for yourself a carved image... You shall not bow down to them nor serve them\" (Exodus 20:4-5, NKJV).Historically, the struggle against idolatry is a central theme in the Old Testament (e.g., Leviticus 26:1; Deuteronomy 27:15; 2 Kings 17:12-16; Isaiah 44:9-20; Jeremiah 10:1-16). The New Testament continues this prohibition, warning that \"flee from idolatry\" (1 Corinthians 10:14; cf. Acts 17:29-30; 1 John 5:21).In contrast, Islamic tradition, as practiced in the rites of the Hajj and Umrah, enshrines certain acts—such as circumambulating, kissing, and bowing before the Black Stone (Hajar al-Aswad), and the Sa’i between Safa and Marwah—which are both physical and symbolic. This essay interrogates these rituals in light of the Second Commandment and argues that they constitute a form of religious syncretism and a re-adoption of pre-Islamic Arabian religiosity.Islamic Rituals: Continuity With Pre-Islamic Practices1.The Black Stone (Hajar al-Aswad)The Black Stone embedded in the eastern corner of the Kaaba is not only touched and kissed by millions of Muslim pilgrims but also given special veneration. The Hadith literature confirms this as a sunnah of Muhammad:\"I saw the Messenger of Allah touch the (Black) Stone and then place his lips on it and wept for a long time.\" (Sunan Ibn Majah 2944; cf. Sahih Bukhari 1520).Further, the Prophet is reported to have said, “Touching them (the Black Stone and the Yemeni Corner) atones for sins” (Tirmidhi 959; Ibn Majah 2950). This confers a redemptive value to the act, transforming it from a symbolic gesture to one of theological import.Historical Origins:Prominent Islamic historians, such as Al-Azraqi (Akhbar Makkah, 9th c.), and Western scholars (Patricia Crone, Gerald Hawting), document that the Black Stone and the Kaaba were objects of veneration in Arabia centuries before Muhammad. Al-Azraqi notes that pagan Arabs performed tawaf and touched the Black Stone, regarding it as a sacred relic.W. Montgomery Watt, inMuhammad at Mecca(1953), writes:“Most of the features of the pre-Islamic pilgrimage were retained by Islam, with only slight modifications.”Similarly, Karen Armstrong inIslam: A Short History(2000), admits:“Many of the customs associated with the Hajj, such as running between Safa and Marwah and the stoning of the devil, were pre-Islamic.”2.The Ritual of Sa’i: Safa and MarwahThe Qur’an (2:158) validates the running between Safa and Marwah, describing them as “symbols of Allah.” Yet, these hills were ancient sites of idol worship. As documented in Sahih Bukhari (vol. 2, hadith 711), the Companions themselves were uncomfortable with these rituals because of their association with Jahiliyyah (the Age of Ignorance), but were reassured by Muhammad.As Karen Armstrong further observes:“Even though the idols were removed, the sites themselves remained objects of veneration, given new religious meaning by Islam.”3.The Stoning of Satan at MinaThis act is based on the legend that Abraham was tempted by Satan at these spots and drove him away by throwing stones. The ritual is found in both Hadith (Sahih Muslim 1219) and Sira literature. But, as John L. Esposito notes inIslam: The Straight Path(1998), such rituals are “pagan in origin, Islamized by the Prophet but essentially retained in their outward form.”Biblical Counterpoint:Christianity rejects the notion of combating spiritual evil through physical acts (Ephesians 6:10-18), instead emphasizing spiritual resistance through faith, prayer, and adherence to the word of God.Scholarly Arguments and Critical Perspectives1.Syncretism and Religious Innovation (Bid‘ah)Despite Islamic claims of pure monotheism (tawhid), Islamic practice displays unmistakable elements of syncretism. As G. R. Hawting argues inThe Idea of Idolatry and the Emergence of Islam(1999), the boundaries between monotheism and inherited Arabian religiosity in early Islam were far from clear.Ignaz Goldziher, a pioneer in Islamic studies, noted:“The Muhammadan cult… is based on a foundation of ancient heathen rites which were practiced by the Semitic races from time immemorial.” (Introduction to Islamic Theology and Law, 1981).2.Scriptural Contradictions and the Problem of AuthorityIslamic sources claim the Black Stone is from Paradise (Tirmidhi 877) and that it will testify for those who touch it on Judgment Day. This quasi-miraculous status attributed to a physical object is antithetical to biblical theology, which insists that no created object can mediate divine favor (Isaiah 44:9-20; Romans 1:21-25).3.Christian and Jewish ResponsesChristian theologians, such as John Calvin (Institutes of the Christian Religion, I.xi), condemned any form of physical object veneration as the essence of idolatry. Jewish sources likewise identify the worship or veneration of stones as abominations (Deuteronomy 16:22; Mishnah Avodah Zarah 4:5).Theological Assessment: Does Islam Break the Second Commandment?While Muslim theologians have vigorously denied any accusation of idolatry (shirk), the evidence indicates that:The veneration of the Black Stone, the circumambulation of the Kaaba, and ritual acts at Safa, Marwah, and Mina are all rooted in pre-Islamic idolatrous practices.These practices confer special status on physical objects, actions explicitly forbidden by the Second Commandment.As scholar Samuel Zwemer writes inThe Cross Above the Crescent(1941):“Despite Islam’s professions of aniconism, its pilgrimages and reverence for stones, tombs, and relics reveal a deep-seated tendency towards material mediators in worship.”Jesus Christ’s words in John 4:21-24 stand as the decisive Christian answer:“...the hour is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem... God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in truth.”Conclusion: Christian Engagement and Missional ImplicationsGiven the overwhelming evidence from both Islamic and non-Islamic sources, it is clear that Muhammad’s establishment of Islamic ritual was not a total rejection of idolatry but a transformation and rebranding of existing pagan customs. For Christians, the Second Commandment remains inviolable, and true worship is entirely detached from physical objects.The Christian’s dutyis to present this biblical truth compassionately and courageously to Muslims and others, inviting them to the pure worship of the living God through Christ alone (Romans 10:9-13; Acts 4:12).BibliographyThe Holy Bible (NIV, ESV, NKJV).The Qur’an (Yusuf Ali, Pickthall, Saheeh International translations).Sahih al-Bukhari, Sahih Muslim, Sunan Ibn Majah, Jami’ at-Tirmidhi.Guillaume, A.,The Life of Muhammad(Oxford University Press, 1955).Crone, Patricia,Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam(Princeton, 1987).Watt, W.

The third commandment, in particular, underscores the seriousness with which God’s name is to be treated:“You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain, for the LORD will not hold him guiltless who takes His name in vain.” (Exodus 20:7, ESV)This commandment has historically been interpreted as a prohibition against the misuse, trivialization, or profanation of the divine name, establishing a clear boundary between what is sacred and what is secular or profane.Jewish Perspective on the Divine NameIn Jewish tradition, the reverence for the name of God (YHWH) is paramount. The Tetragrammaton is considered so holy that it is not pronounced in daily speech, replaced instead with “Adonai” (Lord) or “HaShem” (The Name). TheMishnah(Sanhedrin 10:1) andTalmud(Kiddushin 71a) elaborate on the grave sin of blasphemy or casual usage of the divine name. Rabbinic tradition interprets Exodus 20:7 as not only forbidding false oaths but also prohibiting any irreverent use of the divine name (see:Rashion Exodus 20:7;Maimonides,Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot Yesodei HaTorah 6:2).Christian Theological ReflectionChristian tradition upholds the sanctity of God’s name. The Lord’s Prayer itself begins, “Hallowed be Thy name” (Matthew 6:9), underscoring the principle that God’s name is to be revered and sanctified in all circumstances.Martin Luther, in hisLarge Catechism, writes that this commandment forbids any use of God’s name for swearing, lying, or cursing, and demands that it be invoked only in truth, prayer, and praise (Luther,Large Catechism, I. 54-56).John Calvinfurther emphasizes that any “profanation” of the divine name, especially in contexts of violence or injustice, is an affront to the divine character (Calvin,Institutes of the Christian Religion, II.8.22).Islamic Practice: The Invocation of “Allahu Akbar”Contextual Use and MisuseIn Islam, the phrase“Allahu Akbar”(“God is Greatest”) is a central liturgical formula, used in daily prayers (Salah), call to prayer (Adhan), and various rituals. However, its use is not confined to worship but extends to moments of emotional intensity—including warfare, political protest, and, regrettably, acts of violence and terrorism.Notably, radical groups have weaponized this phrase, uttering it before and during violent acts, thus tying the divine name directly to human acts of destruction.Muhammad’s PrecedentIslamic sources attribute to Muhammad numerous injunctions to invoke “Allahu Akbar” in diverse situations—including battle (see:Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 2955;Sahih Muslim, Hadith 872) and moments of surprise or distress (Riyad as-Salihin, Book 17, Hadith 1320). This habitual invocation risks desacralizing the divine name by frequent and indiscriminate use, often detached from genuine reverence.Theological Critique1. The Principle of SanctityIf “Allah” is indeed the same as the God of Abraham, Moses, and Jesus, then His name must be treated with the same reverence asYHWHin Jewish and Christian traditions. Thecasual,political, orviolentinvocation of the divine name directly contravenes the principle of sanctity established in the Ten Commandments (cf. Leviticus 19:12; Ezekiel 36:21).2. Ethical ImplicationsThe biblical God consistently condemns the use of His name for false, manipulative, or violent ends (Jeremiah 23:25-27; Matthew 7:21-23). The invocation of “Allahu Akbar” during violence not only misrepresents God’s character but weaponizes the sacred for profane ends. As Old Testament scholarWalter Brueggemannnotes, the commandment “forbids trivializing the name of the God who is holy” (Brueggemann,The Book of Exodus, p. 865).3. Comparative TheologyWhile Islamic theology asserts the transcendence and uniqueness of Allah (tawhid), it lacks the strong biblical prohibitions against misusing the divine name. The Qur’an, while prohibiting false oaths (Qur’an 2:224), does not explicitly prohibit the casual or violent use of Allah’s name. TheHadithliterature even records Muhammad encouraging repeated invocation of God’s name in various secular contexts, further weakening the distinction between sacred and profane.Scholarly and Interfaith PerspectivesThe Problem of Religious Violence and the Divine NameContemporary scholars (e.g.,Miroslav Volf,Allah: A Christian Response;Mark Durie,Revelation? Do We Worship the Same God?) argue that the invocation of the divine name in acts of violence is a critical area for interfaith reflection. Volf notes that “the name of God must never be invoked to justify what is contrary to God’s own nature as revealed in love and holiness” (Volf, 2011).Historical ExamplesThroughout history, the misuse of God’s name has been associated with religious violence—not only in Islam but also in Christian and Jewish contexts. However, the biblical commandment stands as an eternal critique of such abuses.Rabbi Jonathan Sacksremarks that “to invoke the name of God for violence is to violate the Third Commandment and to commit the ultimate blasphemy” (Sacks,Not in God’s Name, 2015).ConclusionThe expanded evidence from scriptural, theological, and historical perspectives confirms thatMuhammad’s encouragement of indiscriminate invocation of “Allahu Akbar”—especially in contexts of violence or triviality—constitutes a clear violation of the third commandment. This practice desacralizes the divine name, making it a tool for human agendas rather than a means of true worship and reverence.The God of the Bible demands that His name be kept holy, invoked only in prayer, praise, and truth, and never profaned for vain or evil purposes. Therefore, the use of “Allahu Akbar” as a slogan for violence or political gain stands condemned by the standard set forth in the Ten Commandments.Shalom,Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Servant of Jesus Christ, Our Great God (Titus 2:13)References and Scholarly SourcesPrimary Texts:The Holy Bible, Exodus 20:7; Leviticus 19:12; Matthew 6:9; Ezekiel 36:21; Jeremiah 23:25-27; Matthew 7:21-23The Qur’an: 2:224, 4:43, 16:91 (on oaths)Sahih al-Bukhari, Hadith 2955;Sahih Muslim, Hadith 872Riyad as-Salihin, Book 17, Hadith 1320Jewish Commentary:Rashion Exodus 20:7Maimonides,Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot Yesodei HaTorah 6:2Babylonian Talmud, Kiddushin 71aChristian Commentary:Martin Luther,Large Catechism, I. 54-56John Calvin,Institutes, II.8.22Scholarly Works:Walter Brueggemann,The Book of Exodus: Introduction, Commentary, and Reflections(The New Interpreter’s Bible)Timothy George,Is the Father of Jesus the God of Muhammad?(Zondervan, 2002)Miroslav Volf,Allah: A Christian Response(HarperOne, 2011)Mark Durie,Revelation?

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThe Ten Commandments represent the moral and theological foundation of the Judeo-Christian tradition, given by God to the Israelites shortly after their exodus from Egypt (Exodus 20:1-17; Deuteronomy 5:6-21). These commandments summarize the 613 mitzvot of the Old Testament Law and are divided into two categories: duties to God (the first four) and duties to fellow humans (the remaining six). Of paramount importance is theFirst Commandment, which declares:“You shall have no other gods before Me.” (Exodus 20:3, NKJV)This commandment rejects all forms of idolatry and syncretism, affirming the uniqueness and exclusivity of the God of Israel—YHWHorJehovah—as the only true God.In examining Muhammad’s teachings and claims as found in the Quran, one encounters profound theological divergences that directly contradict the biblical commandments. This paper will focus on Muhammad’s breaking of the First Commandment, thereby challenging his prophetic authenticity from a biblical perspective.The First Commandment and the Identity of GodThe God of the Bible repeatedly reveals Himself by name:“I am the LORD (YHWH); that is My name!”(Isaiah 42:8)“They will know that My name is Jehovah.”(Jeremiah 16:21)The personal name of God,YHWH, is central to biblical revelation and distinguishes Him from all false deities. Nowhere in the Torah, Psalms, or Gospel does God identify Himself as “Allah.” The assertion that the God of Israel, the Father of Jesus Christ, is the same as Allah in the Quran is theologically and historically unsupported by primary scriptural evidence.Muhammad’s Violation of the First CommandmentQuranic Syncretism and the Denial of JehovahInSurah Al-Ankabut 29:46, the Quran states:“And do not argue with the People of the Scripture except in a way that is best... and say, ‘We believe in that which has been revealed to us and revealed to you. Our God and your God is One; and to Him we are Muslims.’”Here, Muhammad proclaims that Allah is the same as the God worshipped by Jews and Christians. However, this equivalence is unsubstantiated:The Quran never refers to God asYHWHorJehovah.The biblical texts (Torah, Psalms, Gospel) never declare “Allah” as God’s name.Jesus consistently refers to “the Father” and uses the divine name “I AM” (John 8:58), never “Allah.”This Quranic claim constitutes asyncretismthat blends distinct theological identities, directly contradicting the exclusivity demanded by the First Commandment.Theological Inconsistency and the Nature of AllahThe Quran describes paradise in terms that contradict both Old and New Testament morality. For example,Surah Muhammad 47:15describes rivers of wine in paradise:“A description of the Paradise promised to the righteous: in it are rivers of unaltered water, rivers of milk, rivers of wine delicious to those who drink...”Yet,Surah Al-Ma’idah 5:90says:“O you who have believed, indeed, intoxicants, gambling... are but defilement from the work of Satan, so avoid it that you may be successful.”If wine is the “work of Satan” in one verse, why does Allah reward believers with rivers of wine in another? Such internal contradiction undermines the consistency and moral holiness attributed to the God of the Bible (cf. Isaiah 5:11, Galatians 5:19-21). The God of Scripture condemns drunkenness and promises no such sensual rewards in the afterlife.The Problem of the Divine NameIs “Allah” the Biblical God?Scholarly and intertextual evidence demonstrates thatYHWHis never rendered as “Allah” in the Hebrew or Greek scriptures. The name “Allah” is linguistically linked to the pre-Islamic Arabian pantheon, where it designated a high god among many, rather than the exclusive, covenantal God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.Nowhere in the Torah (Pentateuch) does God say, “My name is Allah.”Nowhere in the Psalms or Prophets is God addressed as “Allah.”Nowhere in the Gospels does Jesus call God “Allah.” Instead, He uses “Father” (Greek:Pater; Aramaic:Abba).This distinction is not semantic but theological—indicating a fundamentally different understanding of God’s identity, character, and revelation.Critical Analysis and Theological ImplicationsGiven these facts, the following questions arise for Muslim apologists:Where in the Torah, Psalms, or Gospel does God declare His name as “Allah”?Why does the Quran reject the name Jehovah/YHWH, if it claims to be a continuation of the Abrahamic faith?How can Allah permit what he elsewhere forbids (wine), whereas the biblical God is consistently holy and morally unchanging (Malachi 3:6)?If Muhammad taught a different God and broke the First Commandment by denying the exclusive revelation of YHWH, how can he be considered a true prophet by biblical standards?Conclusion: Muhammad as a False ProphetBy breaking the First Commandment—teaching a different deity, promoting syncretism, and contradicting biblical revelation—Muhammad stands in opposition to the commandments of God as given in Scripture. According to the biblical test of a prophet (Deuteronomy 13:1-5), anyone who leads people to worship a god other than YHWH is to be rejected, regardless of signs or wonders.As such,Muhammad’s prophetic claims are theologically invalid from a biblical perspective. He neither upholds the First Commandment nor affirms the exclusive identity of the God of Israel. Christians and Jews, therefore, are compelled by their scriptures to regard him as a false prophet.“You shall have no other gods before Me.” (Exodus 20:3)Shalom,Dr. Maxwell ShimbaServant of Jesus Christ, our Great God (Titus 2:13),Shimba Theological InstituteReferences:The Holy Bible, New King James Version (NKJV)The Quran (Sahih International Translation)Ismail, A.,The Concept of God in Islam and Christianity(2015)Peters, F.E.,The Children of Abraham: Judaism, Christianity, Islam(1982)Anderson, N.,Islam in Comparative Religion(1965)Exodus 20:1-17, Deuteronomy 5:6-21, Isaiah 42:8, Jeremiah 16:21, John 8:58, Malachi 3:6",

    "full_content": "An Academic and Theological CritiqueBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionTheNinth Commandmentis a cornerstone of Judeo-Christian ethics, demanding truthfulness and forbidding false testimony:“You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.” (Exodus 20:16, ESV)This commandment upholds the value of truth and the sanctity of reputation. In this scholarly debate, we critically examine whether the Prophet Muhammad, founder of Islam, upheld or violated this commandment in his teachings, actions, and legacy.Framing the DebateChristian Theological Position:Truth is not merely a social virtue but a divine attribute. Jesus Christ identified Himself as “the way, the truth, and the life” (John 14:6). Lying, false witness, and deception are repeatedly condemned throughout Scripture (Proverbs 12:22; Revelation 21:8).Islamic Position:The Qur’an encourages honesty (Qur’an 2:42: “And do not mix the truth with falsehood or conceal the truth while you know [it]”). However, Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) and certain hadiths introduce nuanced discussions about truth-telling and permissibility of deceit in specific circumstances.Scholarly Critique: Did Muhammad Bear False Witness?1.Use of Deception in Hadith and SiraSeveral authentic hadiths and early Islamic sources record instances where Muhammad allegedly sanctioned or utilized deception:Taqiyya and Kitman: Although more common in Shia jurisprudence, the concepts of concealing faith or intent for self-preservation or strategic advantage are referenced in Islamic tradition. Sunni sources also recognize exceptions to absolute truth-telling.Hadith Example: War and Deception“The Prophet said, ‘War is deceit.’”(Sahih Bukhari52:269;Sahih Muslim1739)Assassination of Ka’b ibn al-Ashraf:According toSahih Bukhari(Vol. 5, Book 59, Hadith 369) and Ibn Ishaq’sSirat Rasul Allah, Muhammad approved a plot in which one of his followers deceived Ka’b ibn al-Ashraf, leading to his assassination.Muhammad said: “Who will rid me of the son of Ashraf?” Muhammad bin Maslama said, “I will deal with him for you, O Messenger of Allah.” … He was given permission to lie for the sake of the mission.2.Theological Perspective: Is Deception Ever Justified?The Bible’s Standard:The Bible offers almost no exceptions for bearing false witness, even in difficult circumstances. Truth is integral to God’s nature (Numbers 23:19).Muhammad’s Example:The permission to lie in certain contexts (war, reconciliation between people, to one’s spouse) is found inSahih Muslim(Book 32, Hadith 6303):“It is not a lie to be used in war, to bring reconciliation between people, or to a wife to please her.”3.Accusations Against OthersJews and Christians:Muhammad repeatedly accused Jews and Christians of corrupting their scriptures and hiding the truth about his prophethood (Qur’an 2:75-79; 3:71), though these accusations lack corroborating historical evidence outside the Islamic narrative.Charges of Polytheism and Deception:Islamic sources allege that Jews and Christians are “people of the book” who “conceal” or “distort” the Word of God (Qur’an 4:46; 5:13-15). From a critical perspective, this could be seen as bearing false witness against whole religious communities without substantiated proof.Islamic ResponseDefenders of Muhammadargue that:Context is critical:“Deception”cited in war is akin to military strategy, not the sort of malicious lying prohibited by the Ninth Commandment.The Prophet’s general teachings emphasize truthfulness and justice (Qur’an 33:70; 4:135).The permission to lie in exceptional circumstances (war, reconciliation, family harmony) is not the same as “bearing false witness” in the legal or malicious sense.Scholarly RebuttalScriptural Consistency:The Biblical commandment makes no exception for “strategic” or “expedient” lying.Ethical Absolutism:Jesus intensifies the call to truthfulness (Matthew 5:37), and the Apostles warn against any form of lying (Colossians 3:9; 1 John 2:21).Historical Impact:Muhammad’s legacy of sanctioning deception in certain contexts has been cited by critics as a precedent for double standards within Islamic jurisprudence.ConclusionDid Muhammad break the Ninth Commandment?From a strictJudeo-Christian perspective, the answer appears to be yes: the prophetic record in hadith and sira literature shows instances where deception and false accusation were permitted or practiced.However,Islamic theologyinterprets these acts contextually, maintaining Muhammad’s integrity within its own ethical framework.Final Question for Debate:Can a prophet of God ever be justified in bearing false witness, or does true prophethood require absolute adherence to the divine standard of truth—without exception?ReferencesThe Holy Bible, Exodus 20:16; John 14:6; Proverbs 12:22; Matthew 5:37.The Qur’an: 2:42, 2:75-79, 3:71, 4:46, 4:135, 5:13-15, 33:70.Sahih Bukhari 52:269; 59:369.Sahih Muslim 1739; 6303.Ibn Ishaq,Sirat Rasul Allah.Prepared by Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological Institute.

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThe Ten Commandments, as recorded in the book of Exodus, form the ethical bedrock of Judeo-Christian civilization. Among them, the Fifth Commandment stands as a cornerstone of social stability and divine expectation:\"Honor your father and your mother, so that your days may be long in the land the LORD your God is giving you.\"(Exodus 20:12, ESV)This commandment is repeatedly emphasized throughout Scripture (Deuteronomy 5:16; Ephesians 6:2), highlighting the importance of honoring one’s parents with respect, kindness, and dignity. In contrast, the life and teachings of Muhammad, the founder of Islam, present a significant departure from this divine mandate.Muhammad’s Disregard for Parental HonorIt is a well-established fact in Islamic tradition that Muhammad was orphaned at a young age, having lost both his mother, Amina, and his father, Abdullah. However, rather than honoring their memory, the hadith literature shockingly records Muhammad condemning both parents as unbelievers (kuffar), thus consigning them to hellfire.Hadith Evidence: Muhammad Declares His Mother a DisbelieverSahih Muslim, one of the most authentic collections of hadith, records the following narration:Abu Huraira reported:The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said,\"I asked my Lord's permission to pray for forgiveness for my mother, but He did not permit me. I asked His permission to visit her grave, and He permitted me.\"(Sahih Muslim, Book 004, Hadith 2130)Classical Islamic exegesis, such as in ‘Awn al-Ma’bud, confirms the reason for this divine prohibition:“His saying, ‘He did not permit me,’ means that she was a disbeliever and it is not allowed to ask forgiveness for a disbeliever.”Thus, by Islamic sources, Muhammad’s own mother died as a “kafir”—an unbeliever—for whom even the Prophet was not permitted to pray.The Fate of Muhammad’s FatherSimilarly, Sahih Muslim also narrates:Anas reported:A man said, “O Messenger of Allah, where is my father?” He replied,“In the Fire.”When he turned away, he called him back and said,“My father and your father are in the Fire.”(Sahih Muslim, Book 001, Hadith 0398)Here, Muhammad unequivocally declares that his father, Abdullah, is in hellfire.The Theological ImplicationsFrom a Judeo-Christian perspective, this attitude is a grave violation of the Fifth Commandment. While the Bible commands believers to honor their parents regardless of their faith, Muhammad’s testimony amounts to a posthumous curse, denying them even basic dignity or remembrance in prayer. Nowhere in the New Testament do we find Jesus ever dishonoring His mother Mary, despite the hardships He faced. In fact, Jesus on the cross ensured Mary’s care (John 19:26-27).Critical Questions and Pagan AssociationsWhy does Muhammad explicitly state that both his parents are in hellfire?Why is his father named ‘Abdullah’ (servant of Allah) if he was a pagan?Does this not suggest that ‘Allah’ was worshipped in pre-Islamic pagan Arabia, even before Muhammad’s prophethood?The etymology and usage of the name ‘Abdullah’ point toward the pre-Islamic veneration of Allah as a pagan deity, sometimes identified with the moon god ‘al-ilah’ or ‘Hubal,’ widely worshipped throughout the Middle East. This pre-Islamic use of “Allah” is akin to Hebrew names honoring Yahweh (Joshua, Hezekiah, etc.), but the context for Allah is demonstrably pagan.Historical sources indicate that Abdul Muttalib, Muhammad’s grandfather, nearly sacrificed Abdullah to Allah, only to substitute him with a hundred camels—another clear example of pagan ritual practices (seeSirat Rasul Allahby Ibn Ishaq).A Tragic Contrast: Jesus and Mary vs. Muhammad and His ParentsIn the New Testament, the mother of Jesus, Mary, is presented as blessed and honored (Luke 1:48). No canonical Gospel or Christian teaching ever depicts Mary as dying in sin or being condemned by her son. By contrast, the Islamic texts assert that Muhammad’s own parents died as disbelievers—an indictment that not only tarnishes the memory of his family but directly violates the Fifth Commandment.ConclusionMuhammad’s explicit statements about his parents, recorded in authentic hadith literature, show a clear disregard for the biblical command to honor father and mother. Instead of upholding the dignity of his parents, he condemned them as kuffar, even declaring their punishment in the afterlife. This theological position not only separates Muhammad from the prophetic tradition of the Bible but exposes a fundamental divergence in the understanding of divine law and familial piety.As Christian theologians, it is critical to assess these issues with both scholarly rigor and fidelity to biblical ethics. The evidence presented here demonstrates that Muhammad, by his own testimony and by Islamic sources, broke the Fifth Commandment, and thus cannot be upheld as a moral exemplar according to biblical standards.References:The Holy Bible, Exodus 20:12; Ephesians 6:2Sahih Muslim, Book 004, Hadith 2130; Book 001, Hadith 0398‘Awn al-Ma’bud, Commentary on HadithIbn Ishaq,Sirat Rasul AllahJohn 19:26-27; Luke 1:48Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute“Looking for the blessed hope and glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ.” (Titus 2:13)",

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteMuhammad and the Violation of the Seventh Commandment: A Theological and Scholarly Critique“You shall not commit adultery.” — Exodus 20:14Introduction: The Seventh Commandment in Judeo-Christian EthicsThe Seventh Commandment, “You shall not commit adultery,” is a cornerstone of biblical morality, signifying the sanctity of marriage and sexual purity as divinely instituted values. Within both the Old and New Testaments, the prohibition against adultery is explicit and repeatedly affirmed (cf. Leviticus 18:20; Matthew 5:27-28). Its violation was considered a grave sin, incurring severe consequences under Mosaic Law.Quranic Law on AdulteryThe Qur’an equally condemns adultery. InSurah An-Nur (24:2), it is stated:“The woman and the man guilty of fornication, flog each of them with a hundred stripes. Let not compassion move you in their case, in a matter prescribed by Allah, if you believe in Allah and the Last Day. And let a party of the believers witness their punishment.”This passage demonstrates a strict legalistic approach to punishing adulterers, prescribing public flogging and calling for no mercy.The Prophet Muhammad’s Contradictions: Historical and Hadith AccountsDespite the Quran’s severe position on adultery, an analysis of Islamic sources and classical commentaries reveals multiple narratives in which the Prophet Muhammad himself appears to have transgressed this very commandment.1. The Incident with Mariyah al-QibtiyyaAccording toTafsir Ibn Kathir (Vol. 6, p. 367)and various hadith collections, there is an account involving Muhammad, his wife Hafsa bint Umar, and his Coptic concubine, Mariyah al-Qibtiyya. One day, while Hafsa was away, Muhammad engaged in an intimate encounter with Mariyah in Hafsa’s room. Upon returning and discovering the event, Hafsa confronted Muhammad, who responded by swearing never to touch Mariyah again—a vow later annulled (Qur’an 66:1-2).Despite this being an explicit case of sexual relations outside the context of marriage, neither Muhammad nor Mariyah were subjected to the Quranic punishment of flogging. This raises a significant theological question:Was Muhammad above the very law he claimed to deliver?2. Sexual Exploitation of Female SlavesSunan Abu Dawud, Book 38, No. 4458reports an instance where Muhammad’s female slave was shared sexually with another man, upon which Muhammad instructed Ali ibn Abi Talib to punish her only after her menstrual bleeding stopped, as she was found to be bleeding at the time.The use of concubines and female captives as sexual objects is explicitly allowed in the Qur’an (Qur’an 4:24), stating:“...And [forbidden to you are] married women except those your right hands possess...”This clause is used to legitimize sexual relations with captive women, outside the covenant of marriage, an idea that is entirely foreign to biblical ethics and the prophetic tradition of the Old and New Testaments (cf. Genesis 2:24; Hebrews 13:4).3. Homoeroticism and Gender Norms in HadithCertain hadiths, includingMusnad Ahmad 16245andSahih Bukhari 1:4:152, allege that Muhammad engaged in intimate acts with young boys, such as sucking their tongues or kissing their mouths, and even displaying his nakedness to them. Such reports, if authentic, point to gross violations of sexual ethics, as recognized in both biblical and natural law.4. Questionable Marital EthicsFurther, Muhammad is reported to have stated that a wife must submit to her husband's sexual demands at any time, regardless of circumstances (seeMkweli Mwaminifu, J. 1-2, Hadith No. 462, p. 204), thereby reducing women to mere sexual objects and undermining the mutual respect foundational to biblical marriage.The Qur’an and the Legitimization of Sexual DevianceThe Qur’an, in some passages, describes paradise as a place of sensual reward involving young boys and beautiful women (Qur’an 52:24; 56:17; 76:19), a depiction that stands in stark contrast to the biblical vision of heaven as a place of holiness and communion with God (cf. Matthew 22:30; Revelation 21:27).Theological and Ethical CritiqueFrom a biblical and theological perspective, Muhammad’s actions—as reported in authoritative Islamic sources—constitute a clear violation of the Seventh Commandment. The New Testament goes even further, equating lustful intent with adultery (Matthew 5:28), and upholding sexual purity as a fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23).The moral inconsistency is therefore profound:The same figure who instituted harsh penalties for adultery is himself portrayed as transgressing those boundaries without repercussion.The Quran and hadith allow for sexual relations with concubines, captives, and even hint at acceptance of same-sex acts, all of which are condemned in the Bible (Leviticus 18:22; Romans 1:26-27; Hebrews 13:4).The Prophet of Islam seems to operate above the law, violating the ethical standards he imposed on others.Biblical Response to False ProphetsJesus warned his followers:“Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves.” (Matthew 7:15)A true prophet must exemplify the law and character of God. The behaviors attributed to Muhammad in the hadith literature disqualify him by biblical standards. As Christians, we affirm that only Christ is the fulfillment of the law and the model of perfect holiness (Hebrews 4:15; 1 Peter 2:22).ConclusionA thorough, scholarly examination of Muhammad’s life—measured by the standard of the Seventh Commandment—reveals clear transgressions according to both the letter and the spirit of God’s law. Far from being above the law, a true prophet is called to embody it. The evidence from Islamic sources themselves is a powerful indictment, inviting Muslims and non-Muslims alike to reconsider the moral claims of Muhammad’s prophethood in light of biblical revelation.Shalom,Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteTitus 2:13References:The Holy Bible, NIV, Exodus 20:14; Matthew 5:27-28; Hebrews 13:4The Qur’an, 4:24; 24:2; 52:24; 56:17; 66:1-2; 76:19Tafsir Ibn Kathir, Vol. 6Sunan Abu Dawud, Book 38Musnad Ahmad 16245Sahih Bukhari 1:4:152Mkweli Mwaminifu, J. 1-2“Life of the Prophet” by Sheikh A.S.

    "full_content": "A Theological Challenge to Islamic Claims of ProphethoodBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionOne of the most striking theological contrasts between the biblical prophets and Muhammad—the founder of Islam—lies in the mode of their calling and revelation. Throughout the Hebrew Scriptures and the Christian Bible, a consistent pattern emerges: the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob calls, appoints, and converses directly with His chosen prophets. From Abraham to Moses, from Isaiah to Jeremiah, divine encounters and direct communication underscore the authenticity of their prophetic office.By contrast, Muhammad—the central figure of Islam—never claimed a single direct conversation with Allah. Instead, all of his revelations, according to Islamic sources, were mediated by the angel Jibreel (Gabriel). This peculiar pattern raises profound theological questions:Why would Allah, who claims absolute power and self-sufficiency, need an intermediary to communicate with his purported final prophet? Why is there not a single verse in the Qur’an in which Allah directly appoints or converses with Muhammad, as with the prophets of the Bible?The Quranic Admission: Allah Spoke to Moses DirectlyThe Qur’an itself admits a special status for Moses:Surah 4:164– \"Messengers we have told you about, and messengers we never told you about. And God spoke to Moses directly.\" (Rashad Khalifa translation)This verse acknowledges a unique privilege accorded to Moses, one not shared with Muhammad. If Muhammad is regarded as the ‘seal of the prophets’ and the greatest messenger, as Muslims assert, why is he denied this direct audience with Allah?The Biblical Pattern: Direct Divine AppointmentA survey of the Old Testament demonstrates that each prophet is called by God directly. Consider these examples:Abraham: \"The LORD said to Abram, 'Leave your country, your people and your father’s household...'\" (Genesis 12:1)Moses: \"God called to him from within the bush, 'Moses! Moses!'\" (Exodus 3:4)Samuel: \"The LORD called Samuel...\" (1 Samuel 3:4)Isaiah: \"Then I heard the voice of the LORD saying, 'Whom shall I send?'\" (Isaiah 6:8)Jeremiah: \"The word of the LORD came to me, saying, 'Before I formed you in the womb I knew you... I appointed you as a prophet to the nations.'\" (Jeremiah 1:4-5)In every instance, it is God Himself who initiates, commissions, and converses with the prophet. No intermediary is necessary.The Islamic Dilemma: An Absent VoiceIn stark contrast, Muhammad’s revelations were, without exception, relayed by Jibreel. The Qur’an is silent on any direct speech from Allah to Muhammad. Not only is there no record of Allah speaking directly to Muhammad, but there is also no account in the Qur’an where Allah commands Jibreel explicitly to relay a message; the claims of angelic mediation rest on tradition rather than explicit Quranic instruction.Theological Problems with MediationThis raises troubling questions for Islamic theology:If Allah is omnipotent and transcendent, why rely on a messenger to speak to Muhammad?How can Muhammad be considered the “seal” and greatest of prophets if denied what was given to Moses and others?Why would Allah, who claims not to need any partners or helpers (“Say: He is Allah, the One and Only”—Surah 112:1), consistently depend on Jibreel for the most crucial task—delivering His final revelation?Where in the Qur’an does Allah ever instruct Jibreel to deliver the message? Such explicit divine commissioning is entirely absent.The Prophetic Test: Authenticity through Divine EncounterThe office of a prophet is validated by direct encounter with God. The lack of such in Muhammad’s life challenges the very foundation of his prophethood. The prophets of old could declare with authority, “Thus says the LORD.” Muhammad, by contrast, could only claim, “Jibreel said...” This is a radical departure from the established prophetic model.Conclusion: Is Muhammad’s Prophethood Bogus?The Islamic narrative leaves us with an inescapable theological dilemma. If direct divine appointment and communication are hallmarks of true prophecy, then Muhammad’s absence of such experience, by the Quran’s own admission, renders his claim to prophethoodquestionable at best and bogus at worst. Moses and other biblical prophets were authenticated by direct encounters with God. Muhammad stands alone, never hearing the voice of Allah, never receiving a direct commission.To Muslim readers:How can you place your eternal trust in a prophet who never spoke to the God who supposedly sent him? How can Muhammad be the greatest of prophets if denied the most basic prophetic privilege?A call to reconsider:It is time to re-examine the claims of Muhammad’s prophethood with intellectual honesty and theological rigor. The evidence is clear: in the matter of divine communication, Muhammad does not meet the standard set by the biblical prophets.By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological Institute",

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteIntroductionIn interfaith dialogues and theological debates, one of the most crucial tasks is to examine claims to divine revelation with careful scrutiny. The Quran makes bold assertions regarding its relationship to previous scriptures, particularly the Bible (the Taurat and Injil). However, a critical evaluation reveals deep contradictions at the heart of Islam's claims, thus exposing the falsity of its doctrine. This post offers a theological analysis showing why Islam cannot stand as the true revelation of God.1.The Quran Affirms the Bible as Divine RevelationThe Quran repeatedly acknowledges the authority and truth of the previous scriptures given by God to the Jews and Christians:“…Those unto whom We gave the Scripture [the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] know that it is revealed from your Lord in truth…”(Quran Surah 6:114)Here, the Quran affirms that the previous revelations – the Torah and the Gospel – were genuine and divinely revealed, existing as true guidance before the coming of Muhammad. This admission is found not only in Surah 6:114 but also in Surah 3:3, Surah 5:46-48, and Surah 10:94, where Muhammad himself is told to consult “those who have been reading the Book before you” if he has any doubts.2.The Quran Claims That God’s Words Cannot Be ChangedIslamic doctrine holds that the words of Allah are unalterable:“And the Word of your Lord has been fulfilled in truth and in justice. None can change His Words. And He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower.”(Quran Surah 6:115)“There is none that can alter the words (and decrees) of Allah.”(Quran Surah 6:34)This is a foundational principle. If Allah’s words are unchangeable, then the previous scriptures – the Torah and the Gospel – remain intact and trustworthy as revelations from God.3.Islam Contradicts the Bible on Essential DoctrinesDespite the Quran’s affirmation of the Bible, it fundamentally contradicts the core message of the Gospel – the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus Christ:Quran:Denies the crucifixion of Jesus.“They killed him not, nor crucified him, but it was made to appear to them…”(Quran Surah 4:157)Bible:Affirms the crucifixion as the central act of redemption.“Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures…”(1 Corinthians 15:3-4)“They crucified Him…”(Mark 15:25)This is not a minor disagreement but a direct contradiction on the most pivotal event in the Christian faith.4.The Dilemma and the Inescapable ConclusionIf the Quran is true, then the Bible must also be true and uncorrupted, since the Quran repeatedly testifies to the authenticity and preservation of the earlier scriptures.If the Bible is true,then Islam is false because the Bible’s core message – especially the crucifixion, death, and resurrection of Jesus – is absolutely contradicted by the Quran.Yet, if Muslims argue that the Bible is corrupted, they must then admit the Quran’s error in affirming the Bible’s reliability and preservation. This undermines the Quran’s own claim of being a confirmation and guardian of previous revelations (Quran 5:48).5.Islam Is Self-RefutingThus, the logic is simple and devastating:The Quran affirms the Bible.The Quran claims God’s Word cannot be changed.The Quran contradicts the Bible on essential doctrine.Therefore, if the Quran is true, the Bible is true. But the Bible contradicts the Quran.Therefore, Islam is self-refuting.Conclusion:The internal inconsistency of Islam regarding the status of the Bible and its own contradictory teachings demonstrate that Islam cannot be a true revelation from the One True God. Christianity stands as the only faith grounded in the consistent and historical revelation of God’s Word.For more in-depth theological resources and interfaith apologetics, visit Shimba Theological Institute.By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteLet me know if you need references, graphics, or further scholarly expansion!Scholarly Expansion: The Self-Refuting Nature of Islam1.The Quran’s Witness to Previous Scriptures: A Closer ExaminationThe Quran’s testimony to the previous scriptures is not a marginal claim, but a repeated assertion that forms a core pillar of its self-identity:Surah 2:41:“And believe in what I have sent down, confirming that which is with you (the People of the Book)…”Surah 3:3:“He has sent down upon you, [O Muhammad], the Book in truth, confirming what was before it. And He revealed the Torah and the Gospel.”Surah 10:94:“So if you are in doubt, [O Muhammad], about that which We have revealed to you, then ask those who have been reading the Scripture before you…”Classical Islamic exegesis(tafsir), such as that ofIbn KathirandAl-Tabari, acknowledge these verses refer to the actual texts in the hands of Jews and Christians in the Prophet’s time—not hypothetical, lost, or secret texts. Therefore, the Quran appeals to the integrity and public presence of the Bible as then extant.2.The Doctrine of Inalterability: Scriptural and Theological WeightThe unchangeability of God’s word is affirmed emphatically:Surah 18:27:“And recite what has been revealed to you of the Book of your Lord. None can change His words…”This is not just a claim about abstract decrees, but specifically about previous “Books” (kutub), which the Quran repeatedly claims to confirm.Islamic Scholarship Admits the Challenge:Tafsir al-Jalalayn:“None can alter His words,” meaning both His promises and His revealed Books.Al-Razi:“There can be no replacement or corruption (tahrif) of God’s word.”Yet, thedoctrine of tahrif(corruption of previous scriptures) arose only centuries later among Muslim polemicists as a response to Christian and Jewish critique—contradicting the Quran’s plain statements.3.Historical and Textual Criticism: The Integrity of the BibleArchaeological and manuscript evidencedemonstrates that the Torah and the Gospels in circulation during Muhammad’s time are textually consistent with those available today:Dead Sea Scrolls (2nd century BC – 1st century AD):Demonstrate the stability of the Hebrew Bible text centuries before Christ and Muhammad.Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus (4th century AD):Show the content of the New Testament is fundamentally unchanged from the era before Islam.No credible historical evidence supports the claim that Christians or Jews corrupted the text after the Quran’s revelation.4.Central Doctrinal ContradictionsThe Crucifixion:Quran (4:157):“They did not kill him, nor did they crucify him, but it was made to appear to them.”Bible:“For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that He was buried, and that He was raised…”(1 Corinthians 15:3-4)Thehistorical consensusamong secular and religious historians—Jewish, Christian, and even most secular Islamic historians—is that Jesus was, in fact, crucified. Muslim denials have no historical support and were unknown among the earliest Christian heresies.5.Theological Implications: What Is at Stake?A. God’s Integrity and ConsistencyIf Allah truly revealed the Torah and Gospel, and if His words cannot be changed, then for the Quran to contradict those revelations is to make Allah inconsistent—or for the Quran to be in error.B. The Doctrine of Abrogation (Naskh)Some Muslims claim that later revelations abrogate (cancel) earlier ones. However, this cannot apply to previous scriptures external to the Quran itself—especially when the Quran claims toconfirmthose earlier revelations, not cancel them (see Surah 5:48).C. The Failure of Tahrif ArgumentsMuslim apologists often claim the Bible was “textually corrupted” (tahrif al-nass) or only “misinterpreted” (tahrif al-ma’na). But the Quran never clearly claims this, and the burden of proof for such claims is on the accuser—one that is not met by historical evidence.6.Scholarly Conclusions from Comparative TheologyChristianitystands on the unbroken testimony of both Old and New Testaments, corroborated by archaeology, manuscript evidence, and fulfilled prophecy.Islamself-refutes by both affirming and denying the core message of the Bible. It stands alone in world religions in claiming to “confirm” the Bible, yet systematically denying its most central truths.Therefore:If the Quran is correct about the Bible’s integrity, Islam is false due to contradiction.If the Quran is wrong about the Bible’s integrity, Islam is false due to a historical error and a failed claim to divine knowledge.7.Final Challenge and InvitationNo serious scholar—Christian, Jewish, or secular—accepts the doctrine of a wholesale textual corruption of the Bible after the 7th century.We invite all seekers of truth to examine the Scriptures and history honestly. The Christian Gospel alone stands vindicated by prophecy, history, manuscript evidence, and spiritual coherence.Islam, by its own testimony, falls.For further reading:Samuel Green, “The Gospel According to Islam”Gordon D.

In the Islamic tradition, Muhammad is upheld as the \"Seal of the Prophets\" (Qur’an 33:40), and his revelation is considered final and infallible by the majority of Muslims. Yet, critical scholarship and Islamic historical sources themselves reveal troubling episodes that cast doubt upon this claim—most notably, the so-called \"Satanic Verses\" incident. This article examines the theological, historical, and logical implications of Muhammad’s confessed encounters with Satanic influence, using Islamic sources and academic analysis to challenge the foundation of his prophethood.1. The \"Satanic Verses\" and Muhammad’s ConfessionThe \"Satanic Verses\" episode is attested in multiple early Islamic sources, includingal-Tabari’sTarikh(History), Volume 6:111, as referenced in the image above. According to these accounts, Muhammad allegedly recited verses acknowledging pagan deities (al-Lat, al-Uzza, and Manat) as \"exalted cranes whose intercession is to be hoped for\" (see al-Tabari 6:107-111; Ibn Ishaq,Sirat Rasul Allah, p. 165). Later, Muhammad claimed that these verses were not from God but were \"whispered\" to him by Satan.“I have fabricated things against God and have imputed to Him words which He has not spoken.”— Muhammad,al-Tabari 6:111This confession raises immediate concerns:If Muhammad, the supposed messenger of Allah, could be deceived by Satan, how many other revelations may have been similarly compromised?Furthermore, how can followers be confident in the authenticity of any revelation Muhammad delivered?2. Theological Problems: Can God’s Prophet Be Deceived?The Qur’an itself asserts that God's messengers are protected from Satanic influence:“And We did not send before you any messenger or prophet except that when he spoke [or recited], Satan threw into it [some misunderstanding]. But Allah abolishes that which Satan throws in; then Allah makes precise His verses. And Allah is Knowing and Wise.”(Qur’an 22:52)Ironically, this verse admits the possibility that Satan can, at least temporarily, influence even God's chosen messengers. This stands in stark contrast to the Biblical standard for prophets, wherefalse prophecy is a sign of disqualification(Deuteronomy 18:20-22).a. Did Muhammad Receive Other Verses from Satan?If the most significant Qur’anic surahs were vulnerable to corruption by Satanic suggestion, how can the Islamic community trust that other verses have not been similarly compromised? The lack of a mechanism for verifying the divine origin of each revelation, beyond Muhammad's own assertion, makes the entire corpus of the Qur’an open to suspicion.b. Why Did Allah Not Prevent This?If Allah is truly all-powerful and all-knowing, why did he allow his final prophet to be so easily deceived by Satan? Should divine omnipotence not guarantee the protection of revelation? The fact that Allah only \"abolishes\" the satanic versesaftertheir recitation does not inspire confidence in the infallibility of the process.3. The Confusion Between Gabriel and Satan: A Tragic DilemmaOne of the greatest ironies is Muhammad’s failure to distinguish between Jibreel (Gabriel), the messenger of God, and Satan, the enemy of God. If both can appear and communicate in similar ways, how can the prophet—and by extension, his followers—have any assurance of the source of revelation? This confusion undermines the credibility of all subsequent Islamic teachings.Did Jibreel and Satan look alike to Muhammad?Why did Muhammad not test the spirits as instructed in Biblical tradition?(1 John 4:1)The episode reveals atheological crisis: If even the prophet cannot reliably distinguish between divine and demonic communication, no Muslim can be certain of the Qur’an’s authenticity.4. Scholarly and Historical ReferencesAl-Tabari,The History of al-Tabari, Vol. 6(trans. W. Montgomery Watt and M.V. McDonald, SUNY Press, 1987)Ibn Ishaq,Sirat Rasul Allah(The Life of Muhammad, trans. A. Guillaume, Oxford University Press, 1955)Ibn Sa’d,Kitab al-Tabaqat al-KabirQur’an 22:52(admission of Satanic interference)Deuteronomy 18:20-22(Biblical test of prophecy)Sahih Bukhari, Volume 1, Book 1, Hadith 3(Muhammad's encounters with spirits)Numerous classical Muslim historians did not shy away from these troubling reports, though later apologetics tried to suppress or reinterpret them. Orientalist scholars such as William Muir, Alfred Guillaume, and others have discussed the devastating theological implications for Islam.5. Conclusion: A Tragedy for Islamic TheologyThe admission—found within Islam’s own canonical sources—that Muhammad could (and did) speak under the influence of Satan, fabricating words in the name of God, is afatal blow to the credibility of his prophethood. If Satan could infiltrate divine revelation once, how can the entire Qur’an or hadith corpus be trusted? Why did Allah, purportedly all-powerful, not intervene until after the event?This crisis remains unresolved. The integrity of Islamic revelation is thusirreparably underminedby its own historical tradition—a great tragedy for those seeking certainty in the words attributed to God.ReferencesAl-Tabari,The History of al-Tabari, Vol. 6, pp. 107-111Ibn Ishaq,Sirat Rasul Allah, pp. 165The Qur’an 22:52Deuteronomy 18:20-22Guillaume, A.,The Life of MuhammadMuir, W.,The Life of MahometSahih Bukhari, Vol. 1, Book 1, Hadith 3By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological Institute*For further reading, students and scholars are encouraged to review the classical Islamic commentaries (Tafsir), original historical sources, and comparative theological studies.",

This reality has profound theological implications and calls for serious reflection by anyone who seeks the truth about spiritual freedom in Christ versus bondage in other systems.80,000 Demons in the Body of MuhammadAs recorded by Daniel Mwankemwa, and echoed by former Islamic scholars, it is said:\"Muhammad was possessed by 80,000 demons who dominated, guided, and commanded him throughout his life.\"The text continues:\"Scholars maintain that when Muhammad began preaching Islam, God sent Gabriel to warn him because he was engaged in evil works. Gabriel urged Muhammad, 'Go to the Christians to learn and be saved.' But the demons within Muhammad refused to let him go and prevented him from receiving salvation through Christ.These demons were so numerous and pervasive that they blocked every avenue through which God's message could reach Muhammad: 40,000 demons settled in his spirit to block the word of God, 30,000 in his mind to blind his reasoning, and 10,000 in his eyes to obscure the truth. Thus, Muhammad was rendered spiritually deaf, blind, and resistant to the Gospel.\"(From the book\"Save Us from the Evil One, The World of Jinn\"by Joshua Kanani Chabu, a graduate of Al-Azhar University, Cairo, UK.28)The Influence of Jinn on Muslim WomenBut the demonic oppression in Islam is not limited to Muhammad alone. The same source reports that Muslim women, particularly when visiting mosques, are often \"entered by jinn.\"On page 34, a jinn named Arafu is described:\"A jinn whose task is to 'please women.' When a Muslim woman is fully committed to her Islamic faith, she may be possessed by a 'male jinn' who provides her with intense pleasure, such that for thirty days she has no desire for her husband. This jinn is one of those that entered her during her conversion to Islam. The tradition even records that when women pray in mosques, they do so without undergarments—an old custom with sinister origins. Aisha, one of Muhammad’s wives, spoke of it. Fathers are even encouraged to honor women who have been possessed by these jinn. Female jinn, on the other hand, are assigned to please Muslim men.\"The Power of Jesus Christ Over DemonsWhat a sharp contrast with the ministry of Jesus Christ! When Christ walked this earth,He gave His followers the authority to cast out demons and set the captives free:“Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy, drive out demons. Freely you have received; freely give.”(Matthew 10:8)The Gospels tell of Christ's encounter with the demoniac of the Gadarenes, a man possessed bya legion of demons(Mark 5:1–13). Jesus asked,\"What is your name?\"and the demons replied,\"Legion, for we are many.\"But with a word, Jesus cast them out and the man was set free!Theological Reflection: Why Did Muhammad Remain in Bondage?I must ask, and I invite you to ponder deeply:Why did Muhammad choose to remain tormented by 80,000 demons until his death, instead of seeking deliverance through the name and power of Jesus Christ?Even today, why do Muslim women reject Christ, knowing that they risk demonic possession, even to the extent of engaging in disturbing rituals within their places of worship?Jesus stands ready to deliver all who call upon Him. The tragedy is not only in Muhammad’s bondage but also in the millions who remain under the influence of these dark powers, refusing the freedom only Christ can offer.Reflect on this:If the spiritual foundation of Islam is so deeply entwined with demonic presence and activity, what does that mean for its message, its prophet, and its followers?Shalom,Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteMax Shimba Ministries Org.",

This article exposes the theological, scientific, and anthropological shortcomings of this hadith, challenging Muslims to reconsider the very foundation of what constitutes divine revelation.Section I: Examining the Hadith—Origins, Transmission, and Canonical StatusTextual Source:The hadith is found inAl-Adab Al-Mufrad253, a respected collection by Imam al-Bukhari, and also appears in other Sunni compilations (e.g., Sunan Ibn Majah 4183). The Arabic reads:لا تُكْثِرُوا الضَّحِكَ فَإِنَّ كَثْرَةَ الضَّحِكِ تُميتُ الْقَلْبَ\"Do not laugh a lot. Much laughter kills the heart.\"Transmission:Reported by Abu Hurayra, one of the most prolific hadith transmitters.Regarded ashasan(good) by many hadith scholars, and widely quoted in Islamic ethics.Canonical Authority:Frequently cited in Islamic sermons (khutbah), Sufi treatises on spiritual discipline, and mainstream Sunni jurisprudence.Used to promotezuhd(asceticism), somberness, and emotional restraint in piety.Section II: Comparative Scriptural Analysis1. The Biblical Testimony: Laughter as HealingThe Bible provides a radically different view, grounded in both Old and New Testament theology:Proverbs 17:22“A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones.”Ecclesiastes 3:4“A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance.”Genesis 21:6“And Sarah said, ‘God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear will laugh with me.’”Luke 6:21 (Jesus speaking):“Blessed are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh.”Analysis:Laughter is depicted as a divine gift, a natural response to God’s blessings, and essential to emotional and spiritual well-being.The “merry heart” is not a spiritual liability, but a source of resilience, healing, and communion with others.Patristic Witness:Early Church Fathers (e.g., John Chrysostom, Augustine) often affirmed the goodness of laughter in moderation, seeing joy as a fruit of the Spirit (cf. Galatians 5:22).2. Interreligious Parallels and ContrastJudaism:Rabbinic literature celebrates humor and joy as essential to study, prayer, and resilience, e.g., “When Adar enters, joy increases” (Taanit 29a).Christianity:Saints and theologians, such as Thomas Aquinas and C.S. Lewis, regard joy and laughter as signs of grace.Buddhism:Laughter is considered a sign of enlightenment in Zen traditions (“the laughing Buddha” motif).Hinduism:Laughter yoga (Hasyayoga) is a respected spiritual practice.Contrast:Only in certain strands of ascetic Islamic, monastic, or ultra-orthodox religious expression do we find strong warnings against mirth—never an absolute prohibition as in this hadith.Section III: Scientific and Medical Evidence—Laughter as Therapy1. Psychological and Physiological ResearchA. Laughter and Cardiovascular HealthAmerican Heart Association(2020): “Laughter reduces artery inflammation and increases HDL (good cholesterol).”Harvard Health Publishing(2019): “Laughter improves blood vessel function and increases blood flow, which can help protect against heart attacks.”B. Neurochemical EffectsLaughter triggers endorphin release, lowering stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline (Berk, L.S. et al., 1989).Boosts dopamine and serotonin, alleviating depression and anxiety (Mora-Ripoll, 2010).C. Immunology and LongevityStudies fromLoma Linda University(Bennett, 2003): Laughter strengthens the immune response, increasing infection-fighting antibodies.Elderly populations with a sense of humor have lower mortality rates (Martin, R.A., 2002).D. Social and Cognitive BenefitsLaughter is a social glue, facilitating trust, empathy, and group cohesion.Used therapeutically for pain management and trauma recovery (Journal of Holistic Nursing, 2011).E. World Health OrganizationWHO officially endorses “laughter therapy” as a tool in mental health programs worldwide.2. Direct Scientific Debunking of the HadithNowhere in reputable medical literatureis there any evidence that “much laughter kills the heart.”If anything, excessive laughter (such as in rare medical conditions likegelastic seizures) is a neurological disorder, not a moral or spiritual failing.The overwhelming evidence is clear:Laughter heals, it does not kill.Section IV: Historical and Sociocultural Analysis—Origins of Somberness in Islam1. The Context of Muhammad’s ArabiaThe Arabian Peninsula during Muhammad’s era was marked by frequent tribal conflict, poverty, and survivalism.Somberness was often equated with seriousness and dignity; frivolity was discouraged among tribal leaders.Many hadiths promote ascetic discipline, frowning upon music, dancing, and even smiling in excess (cf. Sahih Muslim 4925: “Do not laugh too much for much laughter deadens the heart.”).2. Later Islamic SpiritualitySufism:Despite some mystical orders advocating joy and ecstatic expressions, mainstream Islamic law (Sharia) codified this hadith into behavioral norms, especially for scholars, jurists, and mosque leaders.Legal Manuals:Ihya Ulum al-Din(al-Ghazali),Riyadh as-Salihin(an-Nawawi), andAdab al-Dunya wa’d-Din(al-Mawardi) all quote this hadith approvingly.3. Comparison to Christian and Jewish EthicsBy contrast, Christian and Jewish authorities integrated laughter into worship, liturgy, and social customs, recognizing its capacity to reflect the joy of God.Section V: Theological Debate—Questioning the Authority and Consistency of Muhammad’s Words1. Is this Divine Guidance or Human Projection?If Allah is All-Knowing and All-Wise,why would He allow His final prophet to utter and enshrine a saying that ispatently falseby the standards of reason, science, and even basic human happiness?Does this reflect divine omniscience—or merely the psychological disposition and cultural preferences of Muhammad himself?2. Internal Contradictions within IslamQuran 80:39:“Faces that Day will be joyful, laughing, rejoicing at good news.”Even the Qur’an acknowledges laughter and joy in paradise—so why would laughter be deemed “deadly” for the heart on earth?3. Apologetic Rationalizations—A ResponseModern apologists often claim the hadith means “excessive, heedless laughter” that leads to spiritual negligence—not any and all laughter. But the plain text and centuries of interpretation do not qualify it; the statement is universal, unnuanced, and absolute.This post hoc rationalization reveals anembarrassment of inconsistency—the need to reinterpret Muhammad’s words to match observable reality.Section VI: The Verdict of Revelation, Reason, and RealityThe Bible, Science, and Human Experience Are United:Laughter is not a spiritual toxin, but a God-given tonic.Scientific research affirms what Scripture has proclaimed for millennia—joy and laughter are “good medicine.”The Legacy of Prophetic ErrorMuhammad’s myth has led to centuries of cultural suppression of joy and emotional expression in large parts of the Islamic world, with measurable effects on mental health and communal happiness (see Pew Research, 2017).This is not the fruit of the Spirit, nor the intention of a benevolent Creator.Conclusion: Will Muslims Reconsider?If a religion’s teachings are found to be out of harmony with God’s creation and medical science, then the faithful must re-examine thesource of those teachings. The evidence is overwhelming: Muhammad’s statement on laughter is unscientific, unscriptural, and ultimately detrimental to the human spirit. True revelation should lead to human flourishing—not unnecessary sorrow.Will Muslims embrace the joy that God created them for, or cling to a tradition that deadens the heart in the very name of religion?ReferencesHadith and Islamic Law:Al-Adab Al-Mufrad 253, Sahih Muslim 4925, Sunan Ibn Majah 4183, Riyadh as-Salihin 362.Scriptural References:Proverbs 17:22, Ecclesiastes 3:4, Genesis 21:6, Luke 6:21, Galatians 5:22.Medical and Scientific Literature:Berk, L.S. et al.

    "content_preview": "We continue to analyze the arguments in Islamic debates:Today, let us examine the efforts of lecturers in seeking the prophecy of Muhammad, son of Abdullah, in the Bible.The Prophet Isaiah wrote: “Then the book is given to one who is illiterate, saying, ‘Read this, please,’ and he says, ‘I am not literate’” (Isaiah 29:12).When Muslims saw this verse, they thought they had found evidence that Muhammad was prophesied in the Bible because Muhammad was an unlettered person.If you follow the entire 2",
    "full_content": "We continue to analyze the arguments in Islamic debates:Today, let us examine the efforts of lecturers in seeking the prophecy of Muhammad, son of Abdullah, in the Bible.The Prophet Isaiah wrote: “Then the book is given to one who is illiterate, saying, ‘Read this, please,’ and he says, ‘I am not literate’” (Isaiah 29:12).When Muslims saw this verse, they thought they had found evidence that Muhammad was prophesied in the Bible because Muhammad was an unlettered person.If you follow the entire 29th chapter and the context that led to this verse 12, you may end up laughing, although this is not a laughing matter. What Muslims are doing is a great distortion that is leading millions of God's people to eternal destruction in the lake of fire. People are being convinced of lies and embracing them as if they were the truth.Overall, reading chapter 29 is a chapter that pronounces judgment on Ariel (Jerusalem) due to their rebellion against God's laws and commandments, Jehovah. Let us read this chapter carefully:Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city where David dwelt! Add year to year; let feasts come around.Yet I will distress Ariel; there shall be heaviness and sorrow, and it shall be to Me as Ariel.I will encamp against you all around, I will lay siege against you with a mound, and I will raise siege works against you.You shall be brought down, you shall speak out of the ground; your speech shall be low, out of the dust; your voice shall be like a medium’s, out of the ground; and your speech shall whisper out of the dust.Moreover the multitude of your foes shall be like fine dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones like chaff that passes away; yes, it shall be in an instant, suddenly.You will be punished by the Lord of hosts with thunder and earthquake and great noise, with storm and tempest and the flame of devouring fire.The multitude of all the nations who fight against Ariel, even all who fight against her and her fortress, and distress her, shall be as a dream of a night vision.It shall even be as when a hungry man dreams, and look—he eats; but he awakes, and his soul is still empty; or as when a thirsty man dreams, and look—he drinks; but he awakes, and indeed he is faint, and his soul still craves: so the multitude of all the nations shall be, who fight against Mount Zion.Pause and wonder! Blind yourselves and be blind! They are drunk, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with intoxicating drink.For the Lord has poured out on you the spirit of deep sleep and has closed your eyes, namely, the prophets; and He has covered your heads, namely, the seers.Apart from the judgments mentioned above, God continued to say that due to their rebellion, they would not understand His word. That is, they would not be able to hear or know what God is saying even if they read or heard His word. This includes those who are expected to understand this word – namely, the prophets and seers – not to mention those without knowledge of God's word, that is, ordinary people. So, He continues to say:11. The whole vision has become to you like the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one who is literate, saying, “Read this, please”; and he says, “I cannot, for it is sealed”;Then the book is delivered to one who is illiterate, saying, “Read this, please”; and he says, “I am not literate.”Now then, if indeed Muhammad is the one mentioned in Isaiah 29:12, logically, it means he is among those who understand nothing because they are under God's judgment; as we have seen, this chapter is a proclamation of God's judgment due to rebellion. Not bad, though! That is why I said that when you read this argument of the Muslims, you may end up just laughing.But look at this BOOK given to an illiterate person? Now if this book is intended to be the Quran, who are these people who gave Muhammad this book? So the Quran came from PEOPLE giving it to Muhammad?However, since Muhammad is now a prophet who understands nothing due to being under God's judgment according to the logic of this scripture, it means that the message he brought to humanity does not come from the God who created heaven and earth. Yes! Unless, deliberately, you reject the existing logic. Why then should you follow such a person?Make your decisions; your soul is precious, beloved.ShalomDr. Max Shimba, servant of Jesus Christ, the Great God. Titus 2:13",

Aisha said, \"The Prophet said, 'Indeed, your Satan has come to you today!' Aisha asked, 'O Messenger of Allah, do you have a Satan?' He replied, 'Yes, but Allah helped me against him and he became Muslim.'\"Narrated by Aisha: One night, the Prophet was missing and she thought he had gone to one of his wives. She went searching and found him praying in a tent, bowing or prostrating, and murmuring, \"Subhaanaka wa behamdika, laa ilaha illa anta\" (Glory be to You and praise be to You, there is no god except You).The Quran is a Book of Satan Because Muhammad Admitted That Allah is Satan in the Form of an Angel and His Book is the QuranIn Swahili: It is narrated by Anas Ibn Malik: \"I heard the Prophet of Allah saying, 'Allah is Satan in the form of an angel who revealed to me His verses and His book, the Quran, and I am His prophet.' (Umdah Al - Ahkaam: Volume 3, Page 460)In English: Narrated by Anas Ibn Malik: \"I heard from the Apostle of Allah that he said: 'Allah was Satan in the form of an angel that revealed to me the verses and his book, the Quran, and I am his Prophet.' (Umdah Al - Ahkaam: Volume 3, Page 460)In Arabic: رواه أنس ابن مالك: \"سمعت من رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم أنه قال \"كان الله هو شيطان في شكل ملاك كشف لي الآيات وكتابه القرآن وأنا نبي له.\" (عمدة الأحكام المجلد 3، الصفحة 460)The Quran is a Book of Devils and the Devils Work Together with Allah✔Quran 38:36-37: So We subjected the wind to him to blow by his command, gently wherever he directed, and the devils [also] We made subject to him - all kinds of builders and divers.The Quran is a Book of Satan Because Allah Put Great Enmity Between People and Does Not Want Christians to Worship in Spirit and Truth. Look, Allah Even Knows the Sects of Christians Like Roman Catholics, Protestants, and Orthodox✔Quran 5:14: And from those who say, \"We are Christians,\" We took their covenant; but they forgot a portion of that of which they were reminded. So We caused among them enmity and hatred until the Day of Resurrection. And Allah is going to inform them about what they used to do.Explanation of verse 14 to show the greatest conflict and apostasy among Christian sects such as:✔ Roman Catholics✔ Protestants (Seventh-day Adventists, Pentecostals, Anglicans, Lutherans)✔ Orthodox and othersThe Quran is a Book of Satan Because Allah and Muhammad Have Great Hatred Towards Christians and Jews✔Quran 5:51: O you who have believed, do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies. They are [in fact] allies of one another. And whoever is an ally to them among you - then indeed, he is [one] of them. Indeed, Allah guides not the wrongdoing people.The Quran is a Book of Satan Because Allah and Muhammad Have Great Hatred Towards Christians and Jews and Do Not Love Us, and They Forbid Muslims from Attending Christian or Non-Muslim Funerals or Visiting Their Graves✔Quran 9:84: And do not pray [the funeral prayer, O Muhammad], over any of them who has died - ever - or stand at his grave. Indeed, they disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger and died while they were defiantly disobedient.The Quran is a Book of Satan Because Allah Makes Devils Enemies to Prophets Who Are Not From Him. This is Proof Because He Himself is the Unknown God’s Messenger, and That's Why He Prays All the Time, Muhammad Says in Quran 33:56✔Quran 6:112: And thus We have made for every prophet an enemy - devils from mankind and jinn, inspiring to one another decorative speech in delusion. But if your Lord had willed, they would not have done it, so leave them and that which they invent.✔ Allah Prays Like Us to Another God, Muhammad Says, Therefore Allah is Not the Creator of the Heavens and Earth: Question - What is the Name of Allah's God Whom He Worships, and Muhammad's God Whom He Worships, and the God of Muslims?✔Quran 33:56: Indeed, Allah and His angels send blessings upon the Prophet. O you who have believed, ask [Allah to confer] blessing upon him and ask [Allah to grant him] peace.The Quran is a Book of Satan, We Get Proof from Your Book Called Minhajil Muslim, the Guide for Muslim Life, Written by Sheikh Abubakar Jabir Al-Jazair, Translated by Islamic Scholars, Page 589, Ibn Hazm Media Centre, and Also on Page 894, Topic 8 in Aqdu-Dhima (The Relationship Between Believers and Non-Believers)It is written:✔ \"Separating People from the Responsibility of Islam\"✔ What is the Meaning of Dhima?It is an Arabic word meaning the system of communication between human beings (some claim even between intelligent beings).The Quran is a Book of Satan Because Muhammad Commanded That Muslims Should Not Greet Christians and Non-Muslims First✔ The stance on communication for Muslims is stated by Muhammad: \"Do not initiate the greeting to Jews and Christians; if you meet any of them on the road, force them to the narrowest part of it.\" It is necessary to differentiate non-Muslims in appearance so they are recognized by this sign. It is also forbidden to bury non-Muslims in Muslim cemeteries or to stand in respect for them or to greet them, or to sit in the front row at gatherings, according to the words of Prophet Muhammad.The Quran is a Book of Satan Because Muhammad Commanded That It is Forbidden to Build Churches in All Islamic Countries and It is Forbidden to Build Buildings Higher Than the Mosques of MuhammadProhibited Acts in Ahl al-Dhimma (Non-Muslim Rights in Islamic Faith)Ahl al-Dhimma are not allowed to do the following in Islamic countries:It is forbidden to build churches in Islamic countries; this is Muhammad's command.Muhammad said, \"No church shall be built in the Islamic country, nor shall any church be rebuilt that has been destroyed.\" (Al-Mughni by Ibn Qudamah. Nayl al-Awtaar by Shawkani)\"Christians are not allowed to raise their houses higher than Islamic houses (mosques).\" (Baihaqi)This is Why Allah of the Arabs Does Not Want to Be Worshipped or Prostrated to by Any Human Being on Earth, and If You Worship and Prostrate to Allah, Prepare to Go to Hell Where He Will Also Go as per Quran 50:30✔Quran 40:60: And your Lord says, \"Call upon Me; I will respond to you.\" Indeed, those who disdain My worship will enter Hell [rendered] contemptible.The Quran is a Book of Jinn Devils; Here is the Proof. Muhammad is the Prophet of Jinn and Muslim Humans; Therefore, Jinn Devils and Muslim Humans Have Muhammad as Their Prophet and Their Book is the Quran and Their Place of Worship is the Mosque, Quran 72:1-14 and Quran 46:29✔Quran 72:1-14: Say, \"It has been revealed to me that a group of the jinn listened and said, 'Indeed, we have heard an amazing Quran.2. It guides to the right course, and we have believed in it. And we will never associate with our Lord anyone.3. And it teaches that exalted is the nobleness of our Lord; He has not taken a wife or a son.4. And that our foolish one has been saying about Allah an excessive transgression.5. And we had thought that mankind and the jinn would never speak about Allah a lie.6. And there were men from mankind who sought refuge in men from the jinn, so they [only] increased them in burden.7. And they had thought, as you desired, that Allah would never send anyone [as a messenger].8. And we have sought [to reach] the heaven but found it filled with powerful guards and burning flames.9. And we used to sit therein in positions for hearing, but whoever listens now will find a burning flame lying in wait for him.10. And we do not know [therefore] whether evil is intended for those on earth or whether their Lord intends for them a right course.11. And among us are the righteous, and among us are [others] not so; we were [of] divided ways.12. And we have become certain that we will never cause failure to Allah upon earth, nor can we escape Him by flight.13. And when we heard the guidance, we believed in it. And whoever believes in his Lord will not fear deprivation or burden.14. And among us are Muslims [in submission to Allah], and among us are the unjust. And whoever has become Muslim - those have sought out the right course.'\"✔Quran 46:29: And [mention, O Muhammad], when We directed to you a few of the jinn, listening to the Quran. And when they attended it, they said, \"Listen quietly.\" And when it was concluded, they went back to their people as warners.The Quran is a Book of Jinn Devils; Here is the Proof. Muhammad is the Prophet of Jinn and Muslim Humans; Therefore, Jinn Devils and Muslim Humans Have Muhammad as Their Prophet, and Their Book is the Quran, and Their Place of Worship is the Mosque, Quran 46:30-32✔Quran 46:30-32: They said, \"O our people, indeed we have heard a [recited] Book revealed after Moses confirming what was before it which guides to the truth and to a straight path.31. O our people, respond to the Messenger of Allah and believe in him; Allah will forgive for you your sins and protect you from a painful punishment.32. But he who does not respond to the caller of Allah will not cause failure to Him upon earth, and he will not have besides Him any protectors. Those are in manifest error.\"The Quran is a Book of Satan Because Allah Himself Said that He is the Deceiver and He Deceived the Arabs to Believe that Jesus Christ was not Crucified but was Taken Up✔Quran 4:157: And [for] their saying, \"Indeed, we have killed the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, the messenger of Allah.\" And they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him; but [another] was made to resemble him to them. And indeed, those who differ over it are in doubt about it. They have no knowledge of it except the following of assumption. And they did not kill him, for certain.The Quran is a Book of Satan Because Allah Made Jesus Speak Blasphemy About Himself in the Quran✔Quran 3:55: [Mention] when Allah said, \"O Jesus, indeed I will take you and raise you to Myself and purify you from those who disbelieve and make those who follow you [in submission to Allah alone] superior to those who disbelieve until the Day of Resurrection. Then to Me is your return, and I will judge between you concerning that in which you used to differ.The Quran is a Book of Satan Because Allah Made Muhammad Receive Revelations that Led Him to Commit Acts Contrary to God's Laws✔ Muhammad’s marriages and relationships with women are considered by many to be morally questionable. Examples include his marriage to Aisha, a young girl, and his marriage to Zaynab bint Jahsh, the wife of his adopted son Zayd. These actions, justified by revelations in the Quran, raise questions about the nature of the divine inspiration Muhammad received.The Quran is a Book of Satan Because it Contradicts the Bible and Calls for Acts That Are Against Christian Teachings✔ The Quran allows for violence and war against non-believers (Quran 9:5), whereas Jesus taught love, peace, and forgiveness (Matthew 5:39).✔ The Quran permits polygamy (Quran 4:3), while the Bible upholds monogamy as the ideal (Genesis 2:24, Matthew 19:5).The Quran is a Book of Satan Because it Denies the Divinity of Jesus Christ, Which is Central to Christian Faith✔Quran 5:72: They have certainly disbelieved who say, \"Allah is the Messiah, the son of Mary\" while the Messiah has said, \"O Children of Israel, worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.\" Indeed, he who associates others with Allah - Allah has forbidden him Paradise, and his refuge is the Fire. And there are not for the wrongdoers any helpers.ConclusionThe evidence presented above clearly shows that the Quran contains verses and teachings that align with the characteristics of deception, enmity, and opposition to the core beliefs of Christianity. These points illustrate why the Quran is considered by many Christians to be a book of Satan, filled with contradictions and teachings that lead people away from the true God of the Bible.We urge you to carefully consider this evidence and seek the truth. Compare these teachings with the Bible, which consistently promotes love, truth, and the worship of the one true God, Jesus Christ.",

In doing so, they are going against the words of Allah as revealed in the Qur'an. Therefore, it is fair to say they are infidels.Quran 10:47:\"And for every nation there is a messenger. When their messenger comes, it will be judged between them fairly, and they will not be wronged.\"Look at this verse as well:Quran 14:4:\"And We did not send any messenger except [speaking] in the language of his people to state clearly for them, and Allah sends astray [thereby] whom He wills and guides whom He wills. And He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.\"If these verses are true, then Islam is not for non-Arab nations. The Quran says that every people have received their message from God in their own language so they could understand, and the Qur'an was revealed to the Arabs so that the Arabs could understand what Allah is saying.This concept of Allah revealing a book in every language is very important because it is repeated many times and is the basis of this lesson.Quran 16:36:\"And We certainly sent into every nation a messenger, [saying], 'Worship Allah and avoid Taghut.' And among them were those whom Allah guided, and among them were those upon whom error was [deservedly] decreed. So travel through the earth and observe how was the end of the deniers.\"Quran 5:48:\"And We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad], the Book in truth, confirming that which preceded it of the Scripture and as a criterion over it. So judge between them by what Allah has revealed and do not follow their inclinations away from what has come to you of the truth. To each of you We prescribed a law and a method. Had Allah willed, He would have made you one nation [united in religion], but [He intended] to test you in what He has given you; so race to [all that is] good. To Allah is your return all together, and He will [then] inform you concerning that over which you used to differ.\"Quran 36:5-6:\"[This is] a revelation of the Exalted in Might, the Merciful, That you may warn a people whose forefathers were not warned, so they are unaware.\"These verses are complete and clearly explain that Muhammad came only for the Arabs. Allah in the Quran says that every people had their own messenger who warned them in their own language, and that he sent Muhammad to those who had not yet started any guidance and whose forefathers were not warned, meaning the Arabs. In this way, they would have no excuse and could not say, \"But we never received any message.\"Continue reading the Quran here:Quran 6:156-157:\"[We sent] lest you say, 'The Scripture was only sent down to two groups before us, but we were of their study unaware,' Or lest you say, 'If only the Scripture had been revealed to us, we would have been better guided than they.' So there has [now] come to you a clear evidence from your Lord and a guidance and mercy. Then who is more unjust than one who denies the verses of Allah and turns away from them? We will recompense those who turn away from Our verses with the worst of punishment for their having turned away.\"The Quran was clearly sent to the Arabs. Those who are not Arabs cannot understand the Quran, those are the words of Allah. Muslims insist that no translation of the Quran can be accurate. Therefore, it can never be clear to non-Arabic speaking nations and was not sent to non-Arab nations.Another proof that the Quran was sent only for the Arabs is in the following verses:Quran 26:198-199:\"And if We had revealed it to one of the non-Arabs, And he had recited it to them, they would [still] not have been believers in it.\"Just as the Arabs have the right not to believe any book sent in a language other than their own, meaning Arabic, similarly, non-Arabic speaking nations have the right not to believe the Quran, a book written in Arabic. That is why the Quran says Allah will send a messenger in every language so that they themselves can understand.To ensure there is no misunderstanding, Allah reveals this verse:Quran 5:19:\"O People of the Scripture, there has come to you Our Messenger to make clear to you [the religion] after a period [of suspension] of messengers, lest you say, 'There came not to us any bringer of good tidings or a warner.' But there has come to you a bringer of good tidings and a warner. And Allah is over all things competent.\"According to the Qur'an, all people have received revelation. The above verse says the Qur'an is for those who never received revelation, so they may not say, `We never received any bringer of good tidings or any warner sent to us.'This matter is clear, but Allah wants it to be clear even to the least knowledgeable that the Quran was sent to the Arabs only by mentioning the exact geographical locations where Muhammad was sent as the Prophet of Allah.Today, we have learned that the Quran was sent only for the Arabs and not for all nations. Now, I am sure some Muslims may bring up other verses that say Islam is for all mankind. If Muslims do so, then they acknowledge that the verses mentioned above are false.Either the Quran is a package of lies and contradictions, or it is just for the Arabs of Mecca and its surrounding areas as Allah, the god of Muslims, said.In service,Max Shimba, a servant of Jesus Christ, our Great God, and Savior.Copyright © Max Shimba Ministries 2013",

Allah says that he has already judged all Muslims and must fulfill this judgment of all Muslims entering hell.People, what is so difficult or hard to understand here? Why is it that Allah has already declared that all Muslims will enter hell?I know Muslims will start to argue, saying, \"Oh, you do not understand the Quran,\" or \"Oh, you have misinterpreted the verse.\" Let me add more verses from their Quran that further confirm this.SURAT AT-TAKAATHUR, which was revealed in Mecca, tells Muslims:3. No! You are going to know!4. Again, no! You are going to know!5. No! If you only knew with knowledge of certainty,6. You will surely see Hellfire!Allah tells Muslims \"No!\" meaning that what Muslims understand is not correct. Remember, these verses were revealed by Allah to his Prophet Muhammad. Allah tells Muhammad, \"Verse 3: No! You are going to know!\"SO WHY DOESN'T ALLAH TELL MUHAMMAD THE TRUTH DIRECTLY? Why does Allah wait until the Day of Judgment for Muslims to know that Allah is fake and is sending them to hell? This is a great tragedy.MUSLIMS HAVE BEEN DECEIVED:Muslims claim they will enter the hereafter - ALLAH RESPONDS in Surat Al Takaathur, verse 6: You will surely see Hellfire!Muslims claim they follow the religion of the Almighty God. ALLAH RESPONDS in Surat Al Takaathur, verse 3: No! You are going to know!Muslims claim that Islam is the religion of Almighty God. ALLAH RESPONDS in Surat Al Takaathur, verse 4: Again, no! You are going to know!Muslims say that the Quran is the book of the Almighty God. ALLAH RESPONDS by saying in Surat Al Takaathur, verse 5: No! If you only knew with knowledge of certainty,My dear friends, what is so difficult about these verses? They are very clear, and already Allah has started to disown Muslims by saying \"No.\"ALLAH HAS ALREADY SAID THAT WHAT MUSLIMS KNOW IS NOT CORRECT.Allah says to Muslims in Quran Surah 19:71: And there is none among you Muslims but will arrive at it. This is a decree of your Lord which must be accomplished.A SENSIBLE CHRISTIAN WOULD NEVER AGREE TO BE IN THIS GROUP OF HELL.Muslims, I invite you to Jesus, who does not send people to hell.SO MUHAMMAD AND ALL MUSLIMS WILL ENTER HELL?Come today and receive eternal life.God bless you greatly.It is I, Max Shimba, a servant of Jesus Christ, the Almighty God.

Without wasting time, start reading his authentic hadiths.Sahih Bukhari 1:3:63He made his camel kneel in the mosque, then tied its leg with a rope, and then asked, \"Who among you is the Prophet Muhammad?\" At that time the Prophet was sitting among us (his companions) leaning on his arm. We replied, \"This WHITE man who is leaning on his arm is Muhammad.\" Then he said, \"O son of 'Abdul Muttalib.\"Volume 4, Book 56, Number 744:Narrated Isma'il bin Abi Khalid:I heard Abii Juhaifa say: I saw the Prophet of Allah, and Al-Hasan bin 'Ali resembled him. I asked Abu-Juhaifa, tell me about him. He replied that the Prophet of Allah was a white man with black and slightly grey hair in his beard. He promised to give us 13 she-camels, but the Prophet of Allah died before fulfilling his promise.So, the Prophet of Allah was white. That's why Allah does not like Africans and calls them infidels.Volume 2, Book 17, Number 122:Narrated 'Abdullah bin Dinar:My father said, \"I heard Ibn 'Umar reciting the poetry of Abu Talib: And a WHITE man (meaning the Prophet) to whom we turn to for rain, the caretaker of orphans, and the protector of widows.\"Volume 2, Book 17, Number 141:Narrated Anas bin Malik:The Prophet never raised his hands for any prayer except for the prayer of Istisqa' (asking for rain) and he would raise them so high that the whiteness of his armpits could be seen.Volume 1, Book 8, Number 367:The Prophet of Allah showed his thighs, and I saw the whiteness of his thighs.I hope you have read those hadiths about Muhammad and learned something about the ethnicity or nationality of the Prophet of Allah. Muhammad was white, and we do not read anywhere that he denied his whiteness.Why did the early Muslims say that Muhammad was white?Why did Muhammad not deny claims of him being white?SO MUHAMMAD WAS WHITE AND NOT AN ARABGod bless you greatly,In His Service,Max Shimba Ministries Org.MAX SHIMBA MINISTRIES ORG ©2015.

Muslims claim that, in this verse, Jesus denies being \"GOOD\" and asserts that only God is Good. Therefore, they argue that Jesus' denial of being Good contradicts the Christian claim that Jesus is God.You will see that these Islamic preachers teach the community using the Quran and the Bible, stating that Jesus denied being GOOD. They spread this teaching of \"ONLY GOD IS GOOD\" through various media such as radio, pamphlets, debates, books, and video and audio tapes. This has led some Christians to abandon their faith and convert to Islam. Other Christians, although not converting, still believe this teaching. The crucial question every Christian should ask is whether Jesus truly denied being GOOD. I urge you to follow this lesson carefully to understand the truth of this verse:Luke 18:18-19: \"A certain ruler asked him, 'Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?' Jesus replied, 'Why do you call me good? No one is good—except God alone.'\"If you quickly look at how these Islamic preachers teach this Bible verse, you might be convinced to believe what they are teaching. But it is good to study deeply the response of Jesus saying \"Only God is Good\" and see if there is any truth in their teaching that Jesus denied being Good, thus not being God.Let us start our research.In this verse above, did Jesus give an answer or ask a question? Here we see the verses clearly teaching us that Jesus asked a question and did not deny being Good.QUOTE: Jesus replied, 'Why do you call me good?' Here, Jesus asked a question to the person who called him \"GOOD TEACHER\" and did not deny being \"GOOD\" as taught by Islamic preachers in their religious debates.After the person failed to answer why he called Jesus \"Good Teacher,\" Jesus said the following:No one is Good—except God alone. Did Jesus, when saying these words, deny being God?MUSLIMS AGREE THAT ONLY GOD IS GOOD.Is there any part of the Bible where Jesus calls himself Good? Now let us read Jesus in the Gospel of John 10:14Jesus says the following:\"14 I am the Good Shepherd; I know my sheep and my sheep know me.\"IN JOHN, JESUS CALLS HIMSELF GOOD.Therefore, according to Muslims' acceptance that \"ONLY GOD IS GOOD\" and Jesus calling himself Good in the Gospel of John 10:14, today Jesus has answered Islamic preachers that he is Good. Therefore, this title of Good makes him God, according to Luke 18:18-19, \"Only God is Good.\"I hope that today you have understood deeply the meaning of \"Only God is Good\" and that when Jesus said this, he was informing the young man that he is God, and the young man did not make a mistake when he called him GOOD TEACHER.Now, where is the verse where Allah says he is Good?Dr. Max Shimba for Max Shimba MinistriesCopyright © Max Shimba Ministries 2013",

    "full_content": "KNOW THE RELIGION OF ISLAM AND ITS ROOTSIntroductionFor many years, Muslims worldwide have urged Christians to abandon their faith and join Islam. Muslims claim that their religion is the true path before Almighty God and assert that all prophets were Muslims. They even claim that Jesus Himself was a Muslim and that Islam did not adopt or inherit any idolatrous, pagan, or ignorant practices. They argue that Islam is the purest religion. The crucial question is, is it true that Islam did not adopt any idolatrous, pagan, or ignorant practices? To understand this fully, follow this study written by my teacher Evangelist Kobelo and revised by me, Teacher Chaka.Five Main Parts of the StudyWere all the prophets Muslims?The meaning of the word \"Islam.\"Who brought the religion of Islam?Did Islam adopt the practices of the Arabs from the Age of Ignorance?The duty of a Christian after learning about Islam.1. Were all the prophets Muslims?A major argument by Muslims is urging Christians to accept Islam by claiming that all of God’s prophets were Muslims. However, it is important first to examine Islamic books about the arrival of the Quran and what it teaches. Who brought this religion? According to the Quran, as believed by Muslims, it states:Quran 6:14 (Surah Al-An'am - The Cattle)Say: \"Indeed, I have been commanded to be the first among those who submit (to Allah).\"In this verse, we see that Muhammad was the first person commanded to submit to Islam.It is also narrated that Muhammad (SAW) said, \"We Muslims are the last to come.\" This is found in Sahih Al-Bukhari vol. ix Hadith no. 587.Muhammad also told his followers to follow the ways of those who came before them, saying, \"Country by country, step by step, even if they entered a lizard’s hole.\" His companions asked, \"The Jews and the Christians?\" He replied, \"Who else?\" This is found in Sahih Muslim vol. iv in Al-Ilm, Hadith no. 6448. From this response by Muhammad (SAW), it is clear that the religion of Islam was preceded by our Christian faith and even the Jewish religion.Prophets of Jehovah God followed this religion (way).When we read the Holy Scriptures, the Bible teaches us that the prophets were led by this:1 Peter 1:10-11Concerning this salvation, the prophets, who spoke of the grace that was to come to you, searched intently and with the greatest care, trying to find out the time and circumstances to which the Spirit of Christ in them was pointing.1 Corinthians 10:1-4For I do not want you to be ignorant of the fact, brothers and sisters, that our ancestors were all under the cloud and that they all passed through the sea. They were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea. They all ate the same spiritual food and drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank from the spiritual rock that accompanied them, and that rock was Christ.In these verses, we see clearly that all the prophets were led by the Spirit of Christ Jesus, who was within them. Moses and his people were also followed by Christ, who fed and gave them drink. They were all led by the Lord Jesus, who Himself called them \"people of Christ.\" See Mark 9:38-41. This is because the Lord Jesus is our leader. See Matthew 23:9. Furthermore, Jesus is the way (religion), the truth, and the life (John 14:6). Thus, all the prophets were people of Christ because His Spirit was within them, leading them.2. The Meaning of the Word IslamThe word Islam is Arabic and means \"Submission\" or \"Peace.\" In the Quran, the word Islam is mentioned 38 times. Although the word Islam is mentioned frequently, it is different from the religion of Islam. This is because the religion of Islam means submission under the commands of Allah or peace under Allah’s laws. According to the Quran, as believed by Muslims, it states concerning Muhammad (SAW):Quran 6:163 (Surah Al-An'am - The Cattle)\"And I am commanded to be the first of those who submit (to Allah).\"Quran 39:12 (Surah Az-Zumar - The Troops)\"And I am commanded to be the first of those who submit (to Allah).\"3. Who Brought the Religion of Islam?When we read the explanation of verses 19-20 in Surah Yusuf found in the Swahili translation of the Quran, Juzuu 12, 3rd edition, page 311, it explains who brought the religion of Islam to this world. The words are:\"First of all, more than 4,000 years before the advent of the religion of Islam brought by the Prophet Muhammad, they used to call Islam the religion that came to sell people.\"According to this explanation in the Quran, the testimonies of the famous books of hadith by Muhammad in Sahih Al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim, and various books written by Islamic scholars, it is clear that the religion of Islam was brought and established by Muhammad (SAW). A good example of the beginning of the religion of Islam is found in the book titled \"The Life of Prophet Muhammad (SAW)\" written by the former Chief Kadhi of Zanzibar and later Kenya, the late Sheikh Abdullah Saleh Al-Farsy. On page 18, it describes Muhammad’s wife Khadija bint Khuwaylid:\"He returned to his wife Lady Khadija and narrated the incident to her. She believed him immediately, becoming the first person to bear witness to the testimony of Islam. Thus, the first Muslim was a woman.\"In the same book, \"The Life of Prophet Muhammad,\" on page 18, section C, the first Muslims are mentioned:(i) The First MuslimLady Khadija bint KhuwaylidThe Prophet was commanded to teach the religion on a Monday, and Lady Khadija accepted Islam that same day, performing prayers with the Prophet that very night before anyone else in the world. She is truly fortunate.(ii) The Second MuslimSayyidina Ali bin Abi Talib bin Abdul MuttalibHe saw the Prophet and Lady Khadija performing prayers that night and asked, \"What is this worship?\" The Prophet explained and invited him to join, but he initially refused, saying he needed to consult his father. The Prophet forbade him from disclosing the secret. The next morning, the young man returned to the Prophet and declared that he would join them, becoming the second Muslim in the world. He was about 10 years old when he embraced Islam.(iii) The Third and Fourth MuslimsZayd bin Haritha Al-Ka'bi and Lady AymanA free man and the adopted son of the Prophet, Zayd bin Haritha lived with the Prophet and accepted Islam like Sayyidina Ali on Tuesday. He and his wife, Lady Umm Ayman, the nurse of the Prophet, embraced Islam together.These were the earliest Muslims who embraced Islam immediately after Muhammad (SAW) brought the religion of Islam, which he officially established on Monday, the 17th day of Ramadan, equivalent to December 27, 610 AD. Before Muhammad, the religion of Islam did not exist in the world.4. Did Islam Adopt the Practices of the Arabs from the Age of Ignorance?During the Age of Ignorance, before the advent of Islam, the Quraysh tribe, which was Muhammad's tribe, and other Arabs worshipped many gods, about 360 in total. The practice of worshipping many gods is clearly described in the Quran and various Islamic books written by scholars. Some of these books include:(i) Scholar Sayyid Abul A'la MaududiIn his book \"Towards Understanding Islam,\" pages 42-44, he states: \"In the Arabian Peninsula, where darkness prevailed, Arab traders traveled long distances and found it difficult to obtain even a shred of education. Those who could read and write worshipped stones, trees, idols, stars, and spirits; in short, anything that crossed their minds. They knew nothing about the teachings of the prophets who preceded them. They believed that Abraham and Ishmael were their ancestors, but they knew nothing about their religious teachings and the God they worshipped.\"(ii) Sheikh Abdullah Saleh Al-Farsy, former Chief Kadhi of Zanzibar and later KenyaIn his book \"The Life of Prophet Muhammad (SAW),\" page 6, he states: \"Even before the advent of Islam, Christian priests and Jewish rabbis living in the Arabian Peninsula used to warn their Arab neighbors who worshipped idols.\"The Quran mentions various gods worshipped by the Quraysh and other Arabs during the Age of Ignorance:(i) Worship of idolsQuran 25:43-44 (Surah Al-Furqan - The Criterion)\"Have you seen the one who takes his own desires as his god? Would you then be a guardian over him? Or do you think that most of them hear or understand? They are like cattle; no, they are even farther astray from the path.\"The explanation of verse 43 in Juzuu 19 of the Quran states: \"The Arabs, in their ignorance, worshipped a multitude of gods. Some of them would worship anything that pleased them, even a cake that looked appealing.\"Here, we see that the Quran openly describes the Arabs worshipping even a cake and calls them ignorant \"Jahili.\"(ii) Worship of stone idolsQuran 71:22-23 (Surah Nuh - Noah)\"And they have plotted a mighty plot. And they said (to their followers): 'Do not abandon your gods; do not abandon Wadd, nor Suwa', nor Yaghuth, nor Ya'uq, nor Nasr (names of their idols).\"These are false stone idols worshipped by the Arabs. The god Wadd had the form of a woman, Yaghuth the form of a lion, and Ya'uq the form of a horse. These details are found in the book \"History of Islam\" written by Prof. Masudul Hassan, page 43.(iii) Worship of the gods Lat, Uzza, and ManatQuran 53:18-20, 23 (Surah An-Najm - The Star)\"Indeed, he (Muhammad) saw of the greatest signs of his Lord. Have you then considered Lat and Uzza, and another, the third (goddess), Manat? What! For you the males and for Him the females?\"(iv) Worship of Allah by the Jahili ArabsThe Quraysh and their fellow Arabs, who worshipped many gods, including 360 idols, also worshipped Allah as the chief god. They believed that Lat, Uzza, and Manat were the female deities or daughters of Allah. This is confirmed in the explanation of verse 180 in Surah Al-A'raf and the book \"History of Islam\" written by Prof. Masudul Hassan, page 43.Evidence of the worship of Allah by the Jahili Arabs:(i) Birth of Muhammad (SAW)The prayers and supplications of Abdul Muttalib to Allah.When we read the book \"The Life of Muhammad (SAW)\" written by Sheikh Farsy, page 5, it states: \"When the Prophet was born at dawn, his grandfather was called to see his grandson. He was very happy and wrapped the newborn in clothes, carrying him to the Kaaba. He opened the door, entered, and stood praying and supplicating with beautiful Arabic poetry that he composed at that moment. Then he returned with the baby before the sun had risen.\"Another clear evidence showing that Muhammad's father, Abdul Muttalib, prayed to Allah can be found in the introduction to Surah Al-Fil in Juzuu 30, page 946 of the Swahili translation of the Quran, which reads: \"The chief of Mecca at that time was Abdul Muttalib. He went to the Kaaba with some Quraysh chiefs, held the iron latch of the Kaaba's door, and asked Allah (SWT) to protect His house and its servants. At that time, there were 360 idols inside and around the Kaaba.\"(v) The beliefs of Abdul MuttalibIn a book written by a renowned Islamic scholar named Al-Muhsin Barwani, page 153, it states: \"There was no Arab given that name by his grandfather from birth, and that grandfather was not a Christian but followed pagan customs. He did not know the Torah or the Gospel.\"(vi) Muhammad's encouragement to the Quraysh about the god called AllahIn the book \"The Truthful Faithful\" written by Sheikh Said Moosa Muhammad Al-Kindy, volumes 1 and 2, 10th edition, page 130, it states: \"Before receiving prophethood, the Prophet (SAW) used to tell people, 'O people, say Laa ilaha illa Allah, you will succeed.'\"This is clear evidence that Allah was worshipped by the Quraysh and their fellow Arabs, who were polytheists, pagans, and ignorant. Remember, Muhammad was a Quraysh, and when he said, \"There is no god but Allah,\" he was in the Age of Ignorance and did not know the book or faith (Quran 42:52 Surah Ash-Shura).(vii) The god worshipped by Muslims - what is His name?Quran 17:110 (Surah Al-Isra - The Night Journey)Say, \"Call upon Allah or call upon the Most Merciful. Whichever (name) you call - to Him belong the best names.\" And do not recite too loudly in your prayer or too quietly but seek a way between.In this verse, we see that the god worshipped by Muslims is called Allah. In the Quran, this name is mentioned 2,866 times. Remember, the Quraysh and their fellow Arabs worshipped this god called Allah. The crucial question is, did the Muslims not inherit the god of the Quraysh? Reflect on this carefully.(viii) The main city of the Quraysh and their fellow Arabs during the Age of Ignorance where they used to go for pilgrimage is this:When we read the introduction to Surah Quraysh in Juzuu 30, pages 950-951 of the Swahili translation of the Quran, it states: \"The Quraysh tribe was scattered throughout Hijaz until the time of Qusayy bin Kilab, one of the ancestors of the Prophet (SAW). First of all, Qusayy gathered the Quraysh together in Mecca, making the tribe the custodians of the Kaaba. Because of this, Qusayy was called 'the gatherer of people.' He established a government in Mecca and arranged provisions for pilgrims coming from all over Arabia. As a result, the Quraysh gained great fame among the Arab tribes.\"Here, we see that during the Age of Ignorance and paganism, before the advent of Islam, all the Arabs went for pilgrimage in the city of Mecca to the Kaaba, known as \"Baitullah\" or the House of Allah. Remember, this same house was where the pagan Arabs worshipped 360 idols, and Allah was their chief god.The main city for Muslim pilgrimage is this:Quran 3:96 (Surah Al-Imran - The Family of Imran)Indeed, the first House (of worship) established for mankind was that at Mecca - blessed and a guidance for the worlds.Quran 22:27-29 (Surah Al-Hajj - The Pilgrimage)And proclaim to the people the Hajj (pilgrimage); they will come to you on foot and on every lean camel; they will come from every distant pass - That they may witness benefits for themselves and mention the name of Allah on known days over what He has provided for them of (sacrificial) animals. So eat of them and feed the miserable and poor. Then let them end their untidiness and fulfill their vows and perform Tawaf around the ancient House (the Kaaba).When we read the explanation of verse 29 in Juzuu 17 of the Quran, it states: \"Before Islam, the Arabs highly respected the Kaaba. It was an ancient building, so they called it Al-Baytul 'Atiq, meaning the ancient house.\"Just as the pagan Arabs had Mecca as their main pilgrimage city, so do Muslims. Moreover, the Quran describes Mecca as the mother of cities (Quran 6:92 Surah Al-An'am). Muslims worldwide are instructed to face a specific direction during their prayers:Quran 7:29 (Surah Al-A'raf)Say: My Lord has commanded justice, and that you should stand upright before Him at every place of worship...Where is this place to face during prayers?Quran 27:91 (Surah An-Naml - The Ant)Indeed, I have been commanded to worship the Lord of this city (Mecca), who made it sacred...According to these verses, the Quran describes that the Lord of this city (Mecca) is Allah, who was worshipped by the Quraysh and their fellow Arabs during the Age of Ignorance.In their worship, Muslims face towards the Kaaba in Mecca:Quran 2:144-150The Lord of Mecca is Allah, who was worshipped by the pagan Arabs during the Age of Ignorance, and He is the same one worshipped by Muslims.(ix) Circling the Kaaba naked during worship:Before the advent of Islam, the Quraysh and their fellow Arabs used to circle the Kaaba, \"Baitullah,\" naked. This is described in the book \"The Life of Muhammad,\" page 4, written by Sheikh Abdullah Saleh Al-Farsy, who was the Chief Kadhi of Zanzibar and later of Kenya. Not only Farsy wrote about this, but also the renowned scholar Abul A'la Maududi in his book \"Towards Understanding Islam,\" page 43, described the Arabs as follows: Their lives were wild, and their conduct was barbaric. They celebrated fornication, gambling, and drunkenness. Robbery and seizing women by force were their habits. They could stand naked in front of their peers without feeling shame or disgrace. Even their women would circle the Kaaba naked. They killed their daughters to protect their honor and married their stepmothers after their fathers died. They were ignorant even about basic matters like eating, dressing, and washing. Regarding their religious beliefs, they were afflicted with the same disease of wickedness that was spreading worldwide.Remember, Allah was the god worshipped by these Arabs, and their house of worship was the Kaaba. Surprisingly, scholar Abul A'la Maududi says that these Arabs were afflicted with the wickedness that was destroying the world. The question is, did circling the Kaaba and worshiping Allah lead to the world's destruction?Do Muslims circle the Kaaba during their pilgrimage?Before we learn about what Muslims do at the Kaaba, we need to know what the Kaaba is like. The word Kaaba is Arabic, meaning a cube-shaped structure. The Kaaba is a building with a length of 12 meters, a width of 10 meters, and a height of 15 meters. This building is in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. The building is covered with black curtains embroidered with Quranic verses in Arabic using real gold thread. In the eastern corner of the Kaaba, there is a black stone known in Arabic as \"Hajar al-Aswad.\"The Quran instructs Muslims to perform their pilgrimage rituals at the Kaaba:(i) Circling the Kaaba:Quran 22:29 (Surah Al-Hajj - The Pilgrimage)\"Then let them remove their untidiness and fulfill their vows and circumambulate the ancient House (the Kaaba).\"According to this verse, Allah instructs Muslims to circle the Kaaba. Earlier, we saw that the pagan Arabs circled the Kaaba naked. How do Muslims circle the Kaaba?In the book \"How to Perform Hajj,\" written by scholar A. Suleimani, page 16, it states: \"It is forbidden for a man in Ihram (pilgrimage clothes) to wear sewn clothes. Sewing here means for wearing, not for patching. An Ihram consists of two unstitched garments like sheets.\"According to these instructions, during their pilgrimage, Muslims circle the Kaaba wearing unstitched garments called \"Ihram,\" which are two white sheets.(x) Worship involving touching, kissing, and revering the black stone \"Hajar al-Aswad\" in the Kaaba mosque in Mecca:The Quraysh and their fellow Arabs before Islam highly respected the house of Allah, the Kaaba, and the black stone \"Hajar al-Aswad.\" This reverence is mentioned in the book \"The Life of Muhammad,\" page 15-16, written by Sheikh Abdullah Saleh Al-Farsy:\"Building of the Kaaba: When the Prophet was 35 years old, the Kaaba had large cracks and was about to collapse. The Quraysh decided to demolish and rebuild it. The Kaaba had no roof... But when it came to placing the black stone 'Hajar al-Aswad' in its place between the southern and eastern walls, they fought over who should place it. The dispute lasted for five days, awaiting a fight. Then, by good fortune, the Prophet entered, although he had not yet received prophethood. Everyone unanimously said, 'This is the trustworthy one, and we all agree.' The Prophet took the stone and placed it in his cloak. He called each tribe leader to hold the cloak, and together they carried it to its place. The Prophet then placed the stone with his hands, to everyone's satisfaction.\"This evidence shows that the Quraysh and their fellow Arabs before Islam highly respected the Kaaba and the black stone inside it, where they circled it naked. Even Muhammad participated in this, as he placed the stone himself, with the agreement of the Quraysh. The crucial question is, did Muslims not inherit these rituals of ignorance? Continue...Do Muslims perform the worship of touching, kissing, and revering the black stone \"Hajar al-Aswad\"?When we read various Islamic books, we see how Muslims perform the ritual of revering the black stone in the main mosque of Mecca known as the Kaaba or \"Baitullah\" - the House of Allah. Some of these books include:**In the book \"The Truthful Faithful,\" written by Sheikh Said Moosa Muhammad Al-Kindy, volumes 1 and 2, 10th edition, page 75, it states: \"The Prophet (SAW) said: 'The black stone is from Paradise. Whoever touches it, his sins are forgiven.'\"In the book \"How to Perform Hajj,\" written by A. Suleiman, pages 29-30, it states: \"Before starting to circle the Kaaba, it is recommended to first go to the black stone 'Hajar al-Aswad,' located in the Kaaba. Approach it as close as possible without harming others. Face the black stone, touch it, and kiss it three times, and touch your forehead to it three times. This is a Sunnah if there is no crowd. If you cannot reach it, gesture towards it with your hand. Then return to the black stone, touch it, kiss it three times, and touch your forehead to it three times as before. Then say 'Allahu Akbar' three times (while gesturing towards the black stone with both hands). Then add, 'O Allah, with faith in You, belief in Your Book, fulfillment of Your promise, and following the Sunnah of Your Prophet, peace be upon him.' After this, continue circling the entire Kaaba.\"**Remember, the act of circling the Kaaba was done by the pagan Arabs during the Age of Ignorance before the advent of Islam. Now, Muslims also circle the Kaaba. The question is, did Muslims not inherit the rituals of the Age of Ignorance? Reflect on this.What does our God Jehovah teach us about the worship of stones?Leviticus 26:1\"Do not make idols or set up an image or a sacred stone for yourselves, and do not place a carved stone in your land to bow down before it. I am the Lord your God.\"According to the teachings of our God Jehovah, whom Christians worship, it is a great sin to take a stone and bow down to it. Reflect on the actions of Muslims concerning the black stone \"Hajar al-Aswad.\"(xi) Worship involving circling the hills of Safa and Marwa in Mecca before Islam:Quran 2:158 (Surah Al-Baqarah - The Cow)\"Indeed, Safa and Marwa are among the symbols of Allah. So whoever makes Hajj to the House or performs Umrah, there is no blame upon him for walking between them. And whoever volunteers good, indeed, Allah is appreciative and Knowing.\"The explanation of verse 158 states: \"Among the acts of worship that are not valid except in Mecca are these: (a) Hajj and (b) Umrah. Both are almost identical except for a few differences. One of their differences is that Hajj can only be performed in specific months, and the last month of Hajj is the first ten days of the month of Dhul-Hijjah. Other than that, both involve: (1) Circling the Kaaba seven times, (2) Running seven times between the hills of Safa and Marwa, (3) Shaving or cutting the hair. The hills had idols placed on them, and the pagans worshipped them. When Islam came, some Muslims thought it was inappropriate to perform worship at these hills. They were told it was not wrong.\"The details of this explanation are similar to those in Sahih Al-Bukhari vol. ii, pages 415-416, Hadith no. 710, where Asim asked Anas bin Malik (A.S.) if they used to dislike performing Tawaf (circumambulation) between Safa and Marwa. He replied, \"Yes, because it was a custom during the Age of Ignorance before the advent of Islam.\" It is also narrated that Muhammad performed Tawaf of the Kaaba and Sa'i between Safa and Marwa to demonstrate his strength over Safa and Marwa. This is mentioned in Sahih Al-Bukhari vol. ii Hadith no. 711. The surprising thing is that this ritual was performed by pagans during the Age of Ignorance, and Muslims also circle the hills. Furthermore, it is astonishing to see Allah, the god worshipped by Muslims, calling these hills symbols of Allah. This is strange to see hills called that.What does the Lord Jesus teach us about the worship of hills?John 4:19-22\"The woman said to him, 'Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet. Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you say that in Jerusalem is the place where people ought to worship.' Jesus said to her, 'Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father. You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews.'\"In these verses, the Lord Jesus tells us that those who worship on the mountain do not know what they are worshiping. Reflect on the worship of Muslims at the hills, do they know what they are worshiping?(xii) The month of Ramadan:When we read the book \"The Life of Muhammad,\" page 32, written by Sheikh Farsy, we see that the months used by the Arabs before Islam are the same ones used by Muslims. The book states: \"Mecca, since before Islam, was a sacred place for all Arabs. Every year they would come to make pilgrimage in these same months that Muslims now use for their pilgrimage.\"The Arabs were pagans and polytheists, and they had the month of Ramadan, which Muslims believe was the month Muhammad received prophethood. See \"The Life of Muhammad,\" pages 16-17.The worship of fasting in the month of Ramadan for Muslims:Quran 2:183 (Surah Al-Baqarah - The Cow)\"O you who have believed, decreed upon you is fasting as it was decreed upon those before you that you may become righteous.\"It is mentioned in Sahih Bukhari vol. ii Hadith 662, vol. iii Hadith no. 219 and 220, and vol. vi Hadith no. 31 that Muhammad commanded Muslims to fast on the day of Ashura, the tenth day of the first month in the Islamic year, called Muharram. Fasting before Islam was a custom in the religion of Hums, and Islam adopted it.(xiii) Stoning Satan in the valley of Wadi Muhassir:Among the significant rituals performed by Muslims during their pilgrimage in Mecca is stoning Satan. The book \"How to Perform Hajj,\" pages 54, 55, 61, states: \"Pilgrims, upon reaching the valley called Wadi Muhassir near Mina, it is Sunnah to hurry. They proceed to Jamrat al-Aqaba (the big Satan) and throw seven stones they collected in Muzdalifah. After stoning Jamrat al-Aqaba, it is followed by slaughtering.\"For us Christians, we know Satan is a spirit of rebellion (Ephesians 2:1-5) and a spirit of deceit (1 Timothy 4:1-2). Therefore, you cannot defeat Satan by throwing stones at him because he is a spirit. A spirit is wind or breath. The Bible teaches us that we defeat Satan through the correct faith in God, holding onto the word of God, fasting, and prayer. Thus, we will overcome Satan (Ephesians 6:11-18).5. The Duty of a Christian After Knowing About IslamI believe you have learned a lot about the religion of Islam and have seen many things done by Muslims in Mecca during their pilgrimage. Those practices were performed by the Quraysh and their fellow Arabs before the advent of Islam, and again you have seen that the God we worship as Christians does not want worship involving stones and hills. Therefore, your duty as a Christian is to share the Gospel with Muslims and people of other religions that do not believe in the Lord Jesus so that they may believe and be saved. Remember, the Gospel is the power of God that brings salvation (Romans 1:16). Additionally, the Gospel is the word of truth (Colossians 1:5). God bless you greatly.

Believe it or not, here is the truth laid out for you today.On the 10th day of Dhu al-Hijjah, pilgrims leave Muzdalifah, collecting stones along the way. According to the Sunnah, on this first day (the 10th), they are allowed to collect only seven stones. You might be wondering, what are these stones for, and where are the Muslims heading? Continue reading to understand this bizarre ritual.Times for Stoning Satan:On the Day of An-Nahr – the first day of the festival, do not throw stones until the sun has risen:“The Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) while at Muzdalifah, allowed the weak, elderly, and women to move to Mina before others and instructed them not to stone (the Jamaraat) until after the sun has risen.” [Reported by At-Tirmidhiy]One with a valid excuse may delay stoning until just before sunset, but it is best to stone after the sun has risen and before it sets for those without an excuse. (Some scholars permit stoning after sunset for valid reasons, but it is better to try to stone before sunset).The stoning should be done after Zawal (noon when the sun has moved slightly from its zenith) on the remaining two or three days for those not in a hurry.AT MINA, THE STONING OF SATAN BEGINS:Pilgrims throw seven stones at 'Jamrat Al-Aqabah'. Pilgrims throw stones at Satan in the place known as “Mina” near Mecca. Dear readers, it turns out Satan resides in Mecca. The pilgrims engage in this ritual of stoning Satan.Pilgrims return to Mina and stone Satan again, staying overnight on the 11th and 12th days.Does Satan have a physical body that can be hit with stones? Can’t Allah defeat Satan without human intervention? This ritual raises serious doubts about this aspect of Islam.Pilgrims perform this stoning ritual on the 11th, 12th, and 13th days, and they do it at night, not during the day.This clearly shows that Satan is considered part of this religion.Dua After Stoning:It is recommended to face the Qiblah and make dua after stoning each Jamaraat except the last one. A hadith narrated by Al-Bukhari and Imam Ahmad states:“The Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) after stoning each Jamaraat with seven pebbles, would stand facing the Qiblah and make dua, except after stoning the last Jamaraat.” [Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Imam Ahmad]Day of Hastening:If you wish to stay only two days, then on the 12th of Dhul-Hijjah, known as \"Yawm al-Isti’jaal\" - the Day of Hastening – you must stone and leave Mina before sunset. If you delay your departure and are still there after sunset, you must stay an additional day. It is advisable to stay the third night if you have no urgent matter to attend to.Tawaf al-Wida:When you intend to return home after completing the Hajj rituals, perform Tawaf al-Wida (farewell circumambulation) by circling the Kaaba seven times, as done in the initial Tawaf, but this time without performing Sa’ay between Safa and Marwah.Dear readers,This religion is not from God, and nowhere in the Torah, the Gospel, or the Psalms does God command the Israelites to throw stones at Satan. That is why I always say that Allah cannot be the God of Adam, Moses, Abraham, etc. Allah's characteristics are entirely different from the God of the Bible.How can someone in their right mind pick up stones and start throwing them at Satan? Clearly, those who stone Satan are misguided.MORE OF ISLAMIC RITUALS:After completing Tawaf al-Ifadah, return to Mina and stay there for the nights of the 11th, 12th, and 13th for those not in a hurry. These are called the days of Tashreeq. It is sufficient to stay for the nights of the 11th and 12th. On these two or three days, stone all three Jamaraat in the following order: start with the one furthest from Mecca (small Jamaraat), then the middle one, and finally the big one (Jamrat al-Aqabah). Throw seven stones at each while saying \"Allahu Akbar\" with each throw. This is done for three remaining days.I urge all Christians worldwide to pray for these Muslims who travel by air to Mecca to stone Satan. They are blind and deaf, needing the love of Jesus.QUESTIONS FOR MUSLIMS:What benefit does stoning Satan provide?Where do we read that Abraham stoned Satan?Why is this practice of stoning Satan only found in the Quran?I invite you to Jesus, the Great God.Dr. Max Shimba for Max Shimba Ministries Org",

This misconception must be addressed early to enable meaningful discussions.The aim of this work is to demonstrate that the allegations against the Holy Bible by Muslims are not only false but also unfounded when viewed in light of what the Qur’an itself teaches about the Bible. By using the Qur’an – Islam’s own sacred text – we will prove the Bible's integrity. This book is crucial for anyone seeking to share the Gospel with Muslims, as well as for Muslims who genuinely wish to understand what their sacred book says about the Bible.The Qur’an affirms that the Torah, the Psalms, and the Gospel were all revealed by Allah, thus acknowledging them as His words.The Torah in the Qur’anThe Arabic term for Torah is Taurat or Tawrat:Surah 5:44: \"Lo! We did reveal the Torah, wherein is guidance and a light.\" (Pickthall)\"Surely We revealed the Taurat in which was guidance and light.\" (Shakir)The Psalms in the Qur’anThe Arabic term for Psalms is Zabur or Zaboor:Surah 4:163: \"We have sent thee inspiration, as We sent it to Noah and the Messengers after him: we sent inspiration to Abraham, Ismail, Isaac, Jacob and the Tribes, to Jesus, Job, Jonah, Aaron, and Solomon, and to David We gave the Psalms.\" (Yusuf Ali)\"...and to Dawood (David) We gave the Zaboor (Psalms).\" (Hilali-Khan)The Gospel in the Qur’anThe Arabic term for Gospel is Injil or Injeel:Surah 3:2-4: \"Allah! There is no god but He...It is He Who sent down the Law (of Moses) and the Gospel (of Jesus) before this, as a guide to mankind.\" (Yusuf Ali)Surah 5:46: \"And We caused Jesus, son of Mary, to follow in their footsteps, confirming that which was (revealed) before him in the Torah, and We bestowed on him the Gospel wherein is guidance and a light, confirming that which was (revealed) before it in the Torah – a guidance and an admonition unto those who ward off (evil).\" (Pickthall)\"And We sent after them in their footsteps Isa, son of Marium, verifying what was before him of the Taurat and We gave him the Injeel in which was guidance and light.\" (Shakir)These Qur’anic verses explicitly recognize that the Torah, the Psalms, and the Gospel are the \"Words of Allah,\" containing \"guidance and light\" for humanity. Therefore, Allah himself testifies in the Qur’an to the guidance and light within the Torah and the Gospel. Understanding Allah’s purpose in sending the Torah and the Gospel helps us see why it is vital to maintain the integrity of these Scriptures for all eternity.",

Muhammad emphatically answers 'yes.'The core theology of Islam teaches that because Allah sent Gabriel with the Quran to Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, Muhammad and the Quran fulfill and complete the mission and purpose of Christ and the New Testament. Muhammad appears to recognize the importance of the Bible (Surah 4:47; 4:136; 4:163; 5:44-48; 5:82-83; 6:92, 154), but Christianity and the New Testament must humble themselves to Islam and the Quran, the new and superior revelation.Surah 5:15-16 illustrates Muhammad's perspective using a metaphor. In the context of Muhammad's distortion of the Christian teachings of Jesus as the Son (v. 17), and in the context of his claim that the Jews are cursed (v. 13), this passage in the Quran (representing others) states that Christians (and Jews) have been walking in darkness until Muhammad came:5:15 O People of the Book [Jews and Christians] . . . there has come to you now a light from God, and a clear Book [the Quran], 16 by which God guides those who follow what pleases Him to the ways of peace, bringing them out of darkness into light, by His will, and guiding them to a straight path. (Haleem) (compare with 4:157).A modern Christian knowledgeable of the Bible will immediately recognize the metaphor of light. Jesus says He was sent from heaven as the light of the world, and Christians have passed from darkness into light (John 1:4-5, 8:12, 9:5, 12:46; 1 Peter 2:9). But now, Muhammad claims that Christians have been living in darkness, and he has come to clarify things for them, as if they were confused. The Quran offers guidance on the \"straight path,\" a theme repeatedly emphasized in Islamic scriptures (e.g., Surah 1) and \"clarifies things.\" Verse 16 is one of the verses that a Muslim might consider when showing that Islam is a religion of peace. But is it true?A committed Christian, knowledgeable of the Bible, cannot possibly believe that Islam is superior. How can we resolve this stalemate? Should we ignore it? Considering recent events such as the terrorist attacks in the United States (September 11, 9/11), this is no longer possible. Should we pretend that all religions are equal? But this forces us to deny some of the non-negotiable core doctrines that all religions have, which cannot be reconciled. Thus, should we only debate theoretical teachings?Discussing theoretical matters like the Trinity has its place in conversations between Muslims and Christians, but no side can claim to be proven through mere observation. The Quran everywhere affirms the Oneness of God, while the New Testament firmly asserts that Jesus is God and the Holy Spirit is a person. Thus, we are left with one holy scripture against another, and to break this endless stalemate, we must use other methods. (For more reliable information on the New Testament, visit this site; for the inherent problems of the Quran, go here).Since Muhammad opposes Christ and Christianity as true, we Christians must respond. What would Jesus say? As it happens, Jesus has given us clear teachings on how to evaluate a prophet who comes after Him in history, especially if that prophet claims to be greater than Jesus: evaluate their fruits.In the context of the Sermon on the Mount, Christ spoke to the crowds, none of whom were theologians, or very few, but rather lower-class farmers. In Matthew 7:15-20, Christ uses unambiguous language about how to recognize the truth of prophets:7:15 Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves. 16 You will know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes from thorn bushes or figs from thistles? 17 Even so, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. 18 A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit. 19 Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. 20 Therefore by their fruits you will know them.In today’s Western world, where millions of people prefer not to challenge Islam but rather accommodate it, this passage might seem intolerant. But in these verses, Christ understands the danger. Claims of religious truths have come into the world in large numbers, almost every second, and these claims are not merely theoretical; people's lives are at stake. Therefore, the cost of accommodation, especially since 9/11, is too high.Nevertheless, it is Muhammad who claims to be greater than Christ and that his new religion is superior to Christianity. He is the one who initiated the confrontation. Thus, over 600 years before Muhammad's arrival, Christ responded to him and many other self-proclaimed prophets spreading around the Mediterranean with the fruit inspection test.To illustrate, suppose I claim that my way is better than yours. Then I can prove my verbal claims with visible actions. My conduct will be better than yours because my actions speak louder than words. Specifically, if the founder of a religion says that husbands in my community are allowed to beat their wives (Surah 4:34), but you as a founder say that husbands in your community are not allowed to beat their wives, does my claimed superiority stand in real life? I set a bad example in practice, but you do not.What I do is not spreading the fruit of inspection. That is, my fruit or behavior or actual actions are rotten. Thus, Jesus is absolutely right to use this simple analogy for His followers to examine the claims of prophets coming after Him. \"You will know them by their fruits\" (Matt 7:16).We can see the crux of Muhammad’s objection and Christ’s fruit inspection by using a simple logical if-then (cause/effect) argument. This method is known as \"modus tollens\" or denying the consequent (part of the \"then\" clause).(1) If A, then B. If Islam has improved to become better than Christianity, these changes would be seen in practical, observable, and relevant ways.(2) Not-B. But these changes are not seen in practical, observable, and relevant ways.(3) Therefore, not-A. Therefore, Islam has not improved to become better than Christianity.Now we can defend each statement easily.(1) If Islam has improved to become better than Christianity, these changes would be seen in practical, observable, and relevant ways.We have already defended this statement in the preceding section. Examining the lives and actions of the founder of Christianity and the founder of Islam is the first and best way to break the endless stalemate between these two conflicting religions because we can see their behaviors and actions here on earth. You will know them by their fruits.(2) But these changes are not seen in practical, observable, and relevant ways.Defending this statement with tangible evidence clearly addresses Muhammad’s objection to Christ and demonstrates beyond doubt that Muhammad's fruit is bad, while Christ's fruit is healthy and ripe.The following list has already been developed in this article on this site, which is the basis of this article. If the reader believes that the actual actions of Muhammad and the following Quranic verses have been taken out of context or in a non-visible state, then, once again, they should visit other websites provided in the relevant references. These ethically questionable actions happened entirely within Muhammad's community, and Muhammad, in his Quran, commands this cruelty. Also, to see Quranic verses in multiple translations, the reader should go here and type in the references, like 24:2 (24 is the Surah, and 2 is the verse). Ignore the request for Arabic Surah titles quoted differently, and type the numbers only.Muhammad gives nicknames to his weapons and calls himself \"the destroyer.\"Christ never owned weapons because he never fought wars with people.Muhammad in his Quran commands that adulterers be flogged a hundred lashes (Surah 24:2). Authentic Hadiths (words and deeds of Muhammad outside the Quran) command stoning.Christ forgave the woman caught in adultery. The people who gathered to stone her dropped their stones and left. She remained, weeping until Jesus told her to go and sin no more (John 8:1-11).Muhammad in his Quran allowed men to beat their wives (Surah 4:34).Neither Christ nor the New Testament writers permitted or practiced this.Muhammad in his Quran commands that a thief's hand, male or female, be cut off (Surah 5:38).Christ never said to do this. The Apostle Paul said that thieves should work with their hands, not cut them off, so they can have something to share with others in need (Ephesians 4:28). In this matter (and many others), Paul surpasses Muhammad.Muhammad killed poets and political enemies.Christ never killed any of his enemies or even poets (even bad ones).Muhammad in his Quran commands the death penalty or the cutting off of hands and feet for those who wage war or cause disorder in the land (Surah 5:33).Christ, the Prince of Peace, died for the sins of the world so that \"disorder\" and \"war\" would end.Muhammad married Aisha, a girl who had not yet reached puberty, and consummated the marriage with her while she was still a young girl. For full evidence on this peculiar family affair of Muhammad, even for seventh-century Arabia, readers should see this article. The Quran itself permits such illegal marriages for other Muslims as well (Surah 65:4).Christ never did this and never told people to do so.Muhammad in his Quran promises a lush garden filled with \"virgins\" for martyrs who lose their lives in holy wars (Surah 44:51-56, 52:17-29, 55:46-78, 61:10, 4:74, 9:111).Christ's martyrdom on the cross means that Christians are not required to die in holy wars to secure entry into heaven. All they need to do is believe in Jesus.Muhammad killed without justice around 600 Jewish men and enslaved their women and children. This atrocity is celebrated in the Quran (Surah 33:25-27).Christ was a Jew and loved his people. Moreover, he loves all people of the world—even polytheists whom Muhammad killed—and redeems them through his death, burial, and resurrection. He was not sent to kill people.Muhammad launched his religious crusade in 630 CE with 30,000 fighters against the Byzantines, who did not show up (Surah 9:29).Christ never did this. What medieval Europeans did in his name is not the foundation of Christianity. Only Jesus and the New Testament are the foundation, and they did not authorize holy wars. Muhammad, on the other hand, is the foundation of Islam and initiated holy wars against Byzantine Christians and went on many holy wars.Surah 5:16, quoted in the introduction of this article, emphasizes strongly that Islam is a religion of peace. This list, however, contradicts these emphatic words directly. Actions speak louder than words. Therefore, Islam is not a religion of peace, see this site.Again, if the reader believes that these claims are taken out of context, they can click on the above site and then on the other sites provided in each claim.Christians will recognize prophets by their fruits. To put it plainly, Muhammad, the self-proclaimed messenger and prophet (Surah 3:144), has utterly failed the fruit inspection test, while Christ, the Son of God (Matt. 3:16-17), has succeeded with complete victory.(3) Therefore, Islam has not improved to become better than Christianity.This conclusion follows directly and logically.For unbiased people willing to listen to reason, issues of practical matters like wife-beating, flogging adulterers, and marrying prepubescent girls are sufficient to make a decision. Practical actions and policies cannot be ignored unless people choose to close their eyes and refuse to see how things are wrong or perhaps if a prophet has a large army to help enforce his actions on the \"weak\" followers of the \"imperfect\" preceding religion.And this brings us back to theoretical teachings, again using myself and the reader as an example. Before debating theoretical teachings like the nature of God, as a follower of a religion, I must pass the fruit inspection test. Suppose my habit is to kill polytheists in wars involving significant loss of life, instead of converting them through preaching or letting them live if they refuse to convert (Surah 9:4-5). On the other hand, it is not your habit to kill polytheists, but to convert them through preaching and letting them live if they refuse to convert. In these circumstances, I fail the real and visible fruit inspection test, but you succeed. Therefore, I lose my credibility to speak on other theoretical matters about the nature of God and other theoretical teachings that are not visible. It becomes evident that I either serve myself or, worse, serve a weak god. You, on the other hand, have sound practical ideas, so you deserve to be listened to.Similarly, Muhammad's failure in his challenge to Christ can be explained with another if-then argument, this time on the logical principle called modus ponens or affirming the antecedent (the \"if\" clause in the first statement).(4) If A, then B. If Islam has not improved to become better than Christianity in practical, visible, and relevant ways, then it logically follows that it has not improved to become better than Christianity in theoretical matters that are only conceptual.(5) A has been affirmed. Islam has not improved to become better than Christianity in practical, visible, and relevant ways.(6) Therefore, B is affirmed. Islam has not improved to become better than Christianity in theoretical matters that are only conceptual.Both statements can be defended easily.(4) If Islam has not improved to become better than Christianity in practical, visible, and relevant ways, then it logically follows that it has not improved to become better than Christianity in theoretical matters that are only conceptual.Muhammad is the exemplar of Islam since he was the conduit through which Allah revealed the superior religion, so we use him again to assess Islam. Fruit inspection says that if a prophet fails to produce it, then his conceptual claims are suspect. In a non-religious context, this standard is too high because all humans have flaws. A physicist is allowed to discuss theoretical concepts about space and time even if his life is mixed up or even full of sin. But in a religious context, especially when one religious leader (Muhammad) claims to be greater than another leader (Christ), this standard is critical and unavoidable.Furthermore, historical facts confirm Muhammad's failure in conceptual ideas. For example, it is an established fact that the New Testament is reliable, while the Quran has its share of flaws. (For more information on this topic, see these pages here and here). Also, it is a proven fact that Muhammad was not well-versed in higher concepts. What he did was take a mix of ideas circulating on trade routes and incorporate them into his Quran (such as the illogical idea denying Christ's crucifixion in Surah 4:157) and claim them as divine revelation from Allah. Thus, in clear and tangible ways, Muhammad was not improving Christianity (and Judaism) but distorting the two preceding religions. Therefore, historical facts confirm that he may not be accurate in conceptual teachings and does not understand what he is talking about.(5) Islam has not improved to become better than Christianity in practical, visible, and relevant ways.After reading the list in the second point, any fair-minded person seeking to know, who is rational and whose thoughts are not clouded by lifelong commitment to Islam, will conclude that Muhammad has failed the fruit inspection test in practical, visible, and relevant ways.(6) Therefore, it logically follows that Islam has not improved to become better than Christianity in theoretical matters that are only conceptual.These conclusions logically and clearly follow.By using the extensive list of differences between Christ and Muhammad in the second point, why would fair-minded people and those willing to listen to reason listen to Muhammad's theoretical teachings that deny the Trinity or the deity of Christ (Surah 2:116, 6:101, 4:171, 5:73) or that support the distortion of the Quran (unless he has a large army with him)? Fruit inspectors with fair minds and who are willing to listen to reason can see that his Inspired book is questionable because his life was questionable and filled with unjust actions. Indeed, fair-minded people have the right to prefer the true and gentle Book of Christ, even if it is claimed to have \"errors,\" any day and all days over Muhammad's scriptures that claim to be \"perfect\" but are excessive. First, Muhammad must show his exemplary life before being allowed to preach about high theological concepts or before his conceptual revelations are taken seriously.For ordinary Christians, especially the early followers whom Jesus taught in the Sermon on the Mount for first-century Israeli farmers, Christ says that by the fruits of a prophet, his followers will know. Once a prophet's fruit is bad, or starts producing a bad tree, they do not need to inspect his conceptual claims. This person becomes a false prophet - these are weighty words, but they are the words of Christ (Matt. 7:15).Three questions: Does this failure to pass the fruit inspection render the entire debate meaningless? If Christian and Islamic theologians in a conference room want to debate the Trinity, they are free to do so, although there are doubts about how much they can achieve. Their discussions are purely academic. However, they should not expect millions upon millions of Bible-literate Christians worldwide to feel compelled to engage in these debates. But even if they like to discuss high theology, they are free to do so. Muslims should not be surprised, however, if at the end of the day, these Christians do not accept Muhammad and his revelations as true because Christ already told his followers what to look for: good fruits (Matt. 7:15-20). Muhammad lived a controversial life preserved in his Quran, which claims to be eternal and without error, so Christians are allowed to question the Quran on conceptual matters.Is the relationship between practical and theoretical matters something that cannot contradict itself? Christ in Matt. 7:15-20 suggests that this relationship cannot contradict itself. Again, if Muhammad was wrong about practical matters like wife-beating, flogging adulterers, launching military crusades, killing poets and enemies, and promising his fighters lush gardens filled with virgins if they die in holy wars, why should Christians listen to Muhammad on theoretical matters, especially since the New Testament everywhere confirms, for example, that Christ is God and the Holy Spirit is a person? And more importantly, why would Christians want to convert to Islam, given Muhammad's questionable conduct?Is there no good fruit (virtue) related to Muhammad? Even a failure to pass the fruit inspection test can have some good qualities. The founder of a movement should show some level of gentleness if he wants his community to endure. But good qualities do not beat and hurt others. However, bad behaviors beat, hurt, and harm others. The overall picture of Muhammad's life in Medina (622-632) shows him waging wars against polytheists (capturing Mecca); against Jews (expelling and killing them); and against Christians (initiating crusades). In the ten years he lived there, he went on, sent, or initiated seventy-four attacks, raids, or full battles, ranging from peaceful negotiations (very few compared to brutal attacks) to killing raiding parties to capturing Mecca with 10,000 fighters to crusading wars with 30,000 fighters against the Byzantines (who did not show up). No one can cleanse this dark picture with a few good qualities.Therefore, Muhammad does not fulfill or complete the mission and purpose of Christ; quite the contrary, for Christ came to the world to show the love of God. Indeed, Muhammad and Islam are a distorted interpretation of Christ and Christianity, and the Quran is worse than the New Testament from an inspectable perspective.Has Islam improved to become better than Christianity? Based on observable evidence, the answer is a strong no. Muhammad has utterly failed.ShalomDr. Maxwell Shimba",

He increases in creation what He wills. Indeed, Allah is over all things competent.\" (Surah 35:1, Sahih International)The Arabic phrase for \"two, three, and four\" is similar to what is mentioned in Surah 4:3:\"But if you fear that you will not be just, then marry those that please you of [other] women, two, or three, or four. But if you fear that you will not be just, then [marry only] one or those your right hand possesses. That is more suitable that you may not incline [to injustice].\" (Surah 4:3, Sahih International)No Muslim denies that this verse limits the number of wives a man can have at one time to four, provided that he can treat them justly. Considering this, it is consistent to understand Surah 35:1 in the same way—that angels do not have more than four wings.However, by making this claim, the Quran contradicts the Holy Bible on this matter, as there are angels who indeed have six wings:\"In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and the train of his robe filled the temple. Above him stood the seraphim; each had six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. And one called to another and said: 'Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory.' And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke. And I said: 'Woe is me! For I am lost; for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts!' Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a burning coal that he had taken with tongs from the altar. And he touched my mouth and said: 'Behold, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away, and your sin atoned for.'\" (Isaiah 6:1-7, ESV)Furthermore, the so-called sound traditions also contradict the Quran on this point as the hadith states that Gabriel (Jibril) has six hundred wings!Narrated Abu Ishaq-Ash-Shaibani:I asked Zir bin Hubaish regarding the Statement of Allah: “And was at a distance of but two bow-lengths or (even) nearer; so did (Allah) convey the Inspiration to His servant (Gabriel) and then he (Gabriel) conveyed (that to Muhammad). (53:9-10) On that, Zir said, \"Ibn Mas'ud informed us that the Prophet had seen Gabriel having 600 wings.\" (Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 54, Number 455)Narrated Abdullah:Regarding the Verse: \"And he (Muhammad) certainly saw him (Gabriel) in another descent, at the Lote-tree of the utmost boundary.\" (53:13-14) Ibn Mas'ud reported that the Prophet saw Gabriel having 600 wings. (Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 6, Book 60, Number 380)Additionally:Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbas:Allah’s Messenger (ﷺ) said, “I saw Gabriel at the Lote-tree of the utmost boundary. He had six hundred wings, and between each two wings there was a distance of as far as the eye could see.” (Al-Tirmidhi)According to Aisha, this was one of the times Muhammad saw Gabriel in his true form:Narrated Masruq:I said to Aisha, \"O Mother! Did Muhammad see his Lord?\" Aisha said, \"What you have said makes my hair stand on end! Know that if somebody tells you one of the following three things, he is a liar: Whoever tells you that Muhammad saw his Lord, is a liar.\" Then Aisha recited the Verse: 'No vision can grasp Him, but His grasp is over all vision. He is Subtle, and All-Aware.' (6.103) \"It is not fitting for a human being that Allah should speak to him except by inspiration, or from behind a veil.\" (42.51) 'Aisha further said, \"And whoever tells you that the Prophet knows what is going to happen tomorrow, is a liar.\" She then recited: \"No soul can know what it will earn tomorrow.\" (31.34) She added: \"And whoever tells you that he (the Prophet) concealed (some of Allah's orders), is a liar.\" Then she recited: \"O Apostle! Proclaim (the Message) which has been sent down to you from your Lord.\" (5.67) 'Aisha added. \"But the Prophet saw Gabriel in his true form twice.\" (Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 6, Book 60, Number 378)Narrated Aisha:Whoever claimed that (the Prophet) Muhammad saw his Lord is committing a grave error, for he only saw Gabriel in his actual form in which he was created, covering the whole horizon. (Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 54, Number 457)Narrated Masruq:I asked Aisha \"What about His Statement: ‘Then he (Gabriel) approached and came closer, and was at a distance of two bow lengths or (even) nearer.' (53:8-9)\" She replied, \"It was Gabriel who used to come to the Prophet in the form of a man, but on this occasion, he came in his actual form and covered the whole horizon.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 54, Number 458)Finally:Al-Tirmidhi reported:Ibn ‘Abbas met Ka‘b [al-Ahbar] at ‘Arafa and asked him about a certain matter. Ka‘b began to proclaim Allahu Akbar! Until the mountains echoed back. Ibn ‘Abbas said: “We are Banu Hashim!” Ka‘b said: “Allah divided His vision and speech between Muhammad and Musa. Musa spoke with Him twice, and Muhammad saw Him twice.” Masruq said: “Later I went to ‘Aisha and asked her: ‘Did Muhammad see his Lord?’ She replied: ‘You have said something that makes my hair stand on end.’ I said: ‘Calm down!’ She recited the verses: 'No vision can grasp Him.' (6:103) 'It is not for a human being that Allah should speak to him except by inspiration or from behind a veil.' (42:51) Then she said: “But he saw Gabriel in his true form only twice: once at the Lote-tree of the utmost boundary and once at Jiyad in Mecca, with six hundred wings, filling the horizon.” (Islamic Teachings and Beliefs: Volume 1: Prophets in Barzakh, Hadith on Isra’ and Mir’aj, the Immense Merits of Al-Sham, the Vision of Allah, Al-Sayyid Muhammad Ibn 'Alawi al-Maliki, translated and annotated by Dr. Gibril Fouad Haddad, As-Sunna Foundation of America 1999, p.147-148)Now, some attempt to resolve this by claiming that the text of Surah 35:1 does not mean that angels have two, three, or four wings, but rather that Allah sends groups of angels in pairs, threes, or fours. In other words, this passage refers to the number of angels sent together. This interpretation, if correct, contradicts the following verses:\"When you said to the believers, 'Is it not enough for you that your Lord should reinforce you with three thousand angels sent down?' Yes, if you remain patient and conscious of Allah and the enemy come upon you in rage, your Lord will reinforce you with five thousand angels having marks [of distinction].\" (Surah 3:124-125, Sahih International)\"[Remember] when you asked help of your Lord, and He answered you, 'Indeed, I will reinforce you with a thousand from the angels, following one another.'\" (Surah 8:9, Sahih International)We are not aware of any passage in the Quran that speaks of an event where Allah sent angels in pairs, threes, or fours. The number is usually not specified. The only time we read about two angels together is in the story of Harut and Marut. On the other hand, the above verses mention numbers that are far greater.Others might try to argue that the last part of the verse clarifies the meaning of the text:\"All praise is due to Allah, Creator of the heavens and the earth, [who] made the angels messengers having wings, two, three, and four, and increases in creation what He wills. Indeed, Allah is over all things competent.\" (Khalifa)It has been suggested that the final part indicates that Allah can add to the creation of the angels as He wills.The problem with this claim is that it presupposes that the phrase indeed pertains to the previous description about the angels, as opposed to simply saying that Allah can increase His creation as He sees fit, since the text mentions Allah as the Creator of the heavens and the earth. Considering this, one might assume that Allah increases His creation not by adding wings to the angels but rather in relation to the increase of humans, animals, plants, the formation of stars, and so on. This interpretation makes complete sense in light of what immediately follows:\"O mankind, remember the favor of Allah upon you. Is there any creator other than Allah who provides for you from the heaven and the earth? There is no deity except Him, so how are you deluded? ... Allah is He who sends the winds and they stir the clouds and spread them in the sky however He wills, and He makes them fragments, so you see the rain emerge from within them. And when He causes it to fall upon whom He wills of His servants, immediately they rejoice.\" (Surah 35:3, 9-13, Sahih International)Do you not see that Allah sends down rain from the sky? He brings forth fruits of various colors with it. In the mountains, there are streaks of white and red, of varying shades, and some are raven black. Among people and moving creatures and grazing livestock are various colors as well. Only those who fear Allah among His servants have knowledge. Indeed, Allah is Exalted in Might and Forgiving. (Surah 35:27-28, Sahih International)After all, there is a difference between creation and a creature. The phrase does not say: He adds to His creature/creatures what He wills, i.e., putting more wings on them after their creation, but it means that He can add more/different creatures to His creation as He wills.Furthermore, this interpretation overlooks the fact that the same construction is found in Surah 4:3 where no one disputes that the plain meaning of the verse is that the maximum number of wives a man can have is four. Since the same construction is used in Surah 35:1, it becomes very difficult to escape the conclusion that this reference clearly states that four wings are the maximum a single angel can have. That is unless, of course, a Muslim wants to be consistent and claim that none of these texts imply that four is the maximum number, thus suggesting that a man can have more than four wives at one time!Moreover, even if we were to assume for the sake of argument that the last part of the sentence refers to Allah adding extra wings for the angels, this still wouldn't prove the Muslim case. It would only mean that Allah can increase the wings of the angels but not beyond four, i.e., He can make an angel with two wings have three, another with three wings have four, but no more than that since He has designed it such that the most wings an angel can have at one time is four.Besides, it seems that the real reason why Muslims came up with this answer is because they clearly saw the conflict between this verse in the Quran and the hadith. It is very doubtful that anyone would have connected the last part of the sentence about Allah adding to His creation with Allah adding more wings to the angels if the hadith did not mention that Gabriel had six hundred wings.It seems more likely that if there were no traditions about Gabriel having that many wings, Muslims would have no problem admitting that the maximum number of wings an angel can have is four. This is especially so since the Arabic construction is identical to that found in Surah 4:3, which clearly limits the maximum number of wives a man can have to four.We accept that this Muslim answer is purely ad hoc, an argument supported by the opinion of the renowned Sunni scholar Ibn Kathir who wrote the following regarding Surah 35:1:\"<two, three, or four.> means, among them are those who have two wings, those who have three and those who have four. Some have more than that, as mentioned in the Hadith that states that the Messenger of Allah saw Jibril (peace be upon him) on the Night of the Isra with six hundred wings. Between each pair of wings, there was a distance like that between the east and the west. Allah says...<He increases in creation what He wills. Indeed, Allah is over all things competent.> As-Suddi said, 'He adds wings to them and creates them as He wills.'\"(Source; emphasis ours)Notice that Ibn Kathir says that some angels have more than four wings based on the hadith, not because of the text itself. This highlights the truly ad hoc nature of the Muslim argument.More importantly, if Muslims still insist that their interpretation of Surah 35:1 is correct, then they exacerbate the problem. After all, the claim that Muhammad saw the true form of Gabriel directly contradicts the Quran, which clearly states that humans cannot see the true form of angels, which is why they take on human forms!\"And they say, 'Why has an angel not been sent down to him?' But if We had sent down an angel, the matter would have been decided; then they would not be reprieved. And if We had made him an angel, We would have made him [appear as] a man, and We would have covered them with that in which they cover themselves.\" (Surah 6:8-9, Sahih International)The two Jalals explained why angels must take human forms:\"And had We appointed him an angel, We would assuredly have made him (as) a man, that is, We would have sent him in the form of a man, so that they would be able to see him, for no human being is capable of seeing an angel and surviving; and We would have confused them when they are [now] confused.\" (Tafsir al-Jalalayn; source; bold and underline emphasis ours)Ibn Kathir writes:\"And if We had made him an angel, We would have certainly made him [appear as] a man. And We would have confounded them in what they confuse themselves.\"Meaning, if We had sent an angel along with the human Messenger, or if We had sent an angel as a Messenger to mankind, he would have appeared in human form so that they could speak to him and benefit from his teachings. In this case, the angel (in human form) would have brought them the same confusion that they brought upon themselves! Allah said...\"Say: 'If there were angels walking about on the earth, We would surely have sent down to them from the heaven an angel as a Messenger.'\" (17:95)It is a mercy from Allah to His creatures that He sends messengers from among themselves so they can talk to them and benefit from their teachings. In another Ayah, Allah said...\"Indeed, Allah conferred a great favor upon the believers when He sent among them a Messenger from among themselves, reciting to them His verses and purifying them.\" (3:164)Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn Abbas said about Ayah [6:9 above]: \"If an angel were sent to them, he would have come in the shape of a man because they would not be able to look at the angel because of the light.\" (Tafsir Ibn Kathir (Abridged) (Surat An-Nisa, Ayah 148 to the end of Surat Al-An’am), abridged by a group of scholars under the supervision of Shaykh Safiur-Rahman Al-Mubarakpuri [Darussalam Publishers & Distributors, Riyadh, Houston, New York, Lahore, First Edition: January 2000], Parts 6, 7 & 8, Volume 3, p. 317-318; bold and underline emphasis ours)Regarding this Surah, the late Muhammad Asad said:\"8 That is, 'We would have confused them about what they are now confounded.' Since it is impossible for mortal man to see angels as they really are, the hypothetical angelic bringer of a message would have had to assume the shape of a human being—and thus, the very demand for a direct 'angelic' revelation would have remained unsatisfied, and their confusion would have persisted.\" (Source; bold emphasis ours)He reiterates this point in his commentary on Surah 19:17, which mentions the Spirit of God appearing to Mary as a man:\"14 As pointed out in surah 2, note 71, and surah 16, note 2, the term ruh is often used in the Qur’an to describe God’s guidance. Occasionally, however, it is used to describe the medium through which such guidance is imparted to God’s elect—namely, an angel. Since— as stated in 6:9—mortal man cannot see angels as they really are, God caused them to appear to Mary 'in the shape of a well-made human being', i.e., in a form accessible to her perception. According to Razi, the designation of an angel as ruh ('soul' or 'spirit') indicates that this category of beings is purely spiritual, without any physical element.\" (Source; bold emphasis ours)This, perhaps, explains why the Quran mentions angels appearing to prophets in human forms as follows:\"And when Our messengers came to Lot, he was anguished for them and felt for them great discomfort and said, 'This is a trying day.' And his people came hastening to him, and before [this] they had been doing evil deeds. He said, 'O my people, these are my daughters; they are purer for you [if you marry them]. So fear Allah and do not disgrace me concerning my guests. Is there not among you a man of reason?' They said, 'You have already known that we have not concerning your daughters any claim, and indeed, you know what we want.' He said, 'If only I had against you some power or could take refuge in a strong support.' The angels said, 'O Lot, indeed we are messengers of your Lord; [therefore] they will never reach you. So set out with your family during a portion of the night and let not any among you look back—except your wife; indeed, she will be struck by that which strikes them. Indeed, their appointment is [for] the morning. Is not the morning near?' So when Our command came, We made the highest part [of the city] its lowest and rained upon them stones of layered hard clay, [which were] marked from your Lord. And Allah’s punishment is not from the wrongdoers [very] far.\" (Surah 11:77-83, Sahih International)But if no human can see an angel except in human form, then this means Muhammad could not have seen the true form of Gabriel. But if he did not see the true form of Gabriel, then all those traditions that claim he did must be mistaken! Thus, no matter how one tries to reconcile these contradictory claims, there will always be problems between what the Quran and the Hadith say.Shalom,Dr. Max Shimba for Max Shimba Ministries",

Its direction is where the sun rises in the morning.The name \"East\" comes from the Arabic wordمشرق(mashriq), which means \"the place where the sun rises.\"East is usually on the right side of a map.What is the West?West is one of the four cardinal directions. Its direction is where the sun sets.West is also the name of the evening prayer time for Muslims.The name \"West\" comes from the Arabic wordمَغْرِب(maghrib), which means \"the place where the sun sets.\"West is usually on the left side of a map.What is a Compass?A compass is a device used to determine direction. It is essential for navigation at sea or on land without visible landmarks like in a desert.A compass has four main directions: North, East, South, and West.Intermediate directions are mentioned as northeast/northwest and southeast/southwest (in English, Northeast NE/Northwest NW and Southeast SE/Southwest SW).It is possible to mention more precise directions, for example, south-southwest (SSW) or west-southwest (WSW).Surah Al-Ma'arij, Ayah 40: \"But no! I swear by the Lord of all points in the East and the West that We are certainly able.\"Here, Muhammad, who is the speaker of the Quran, contradicts his initial claim that there are two Easts and two Wests inSurah Ar-Rahman, Ayah 17.Besides these four directions, there are other directions.Observe the following compass, directions a - h are pronounced as follows:NorthNorth-northeastNortheastEast-northeastEastEast-southeastSoutheastSouth-southeastSouthSouth-southwestSouthwestWest-southwestWestWest-northwestNorthwestNorth-northwestTo remember easily, imagine you are saying, \"North of northeast, north of northeast, etc.\"The sun rises in the East and sets in the West.When the sun rises, we say it has dawned or it is sunrise.It is good to understand the relationship between the sun's direction, time, and the direction of the shadow. For example:In the morning, the sun is in the East. The shadow is in the West.In the afternoon, the sun is in the West. The shadow is in the East.When the sun sets, it is called sunset or dusk or West.North is the top of the compass. The compass starts from the North.Another name for North is Shimali or Shemali, and Matlahi is another name for East.The sun is opposite to the shadow, meaning if the sun is in the South, the shadow will be in the North.Exercise Aa) One morning as I was heading to school, my shadow was in front of me.In which direction was the school? __________In which direction was my home? _______b) One evening as I was coming back from grazing, my shadow was on my right side. In which direction was I heading?c) Juma lives southeast of Fatuma. In which direction does Fatuma live from Juma?d) In which direction does the sun set?Exercise Ba) What is the direction found between South and West?b) What is the direction found between West and East?c) What is the direction found between North-northeast and North?d) What is the direction found between South-southwest and West?e) What is the direction found between North and East?THAT'S WHY I CONTINUE TO SAY ALLAH IS NOT GOD.Shalom,Dr. Max Shimba, a servant of Jesus Christ, the Mighty God(Titus 2:13)",

    "full_content": "na Dr. Maxwell ShimbaMoja ya maswali yanayoulizwa sana kuhusu Biblia ni \"Kaini alipata wapi mke wake?\" Wanaoshuku wamegundua kuwa Wakristo wengi wanashindwa kujibu swali hili, lakini jibu si gumu kama unavyoweza kufikiria.Miaka michache iliyopita, nilinunua Biblia ya Watoto ya Dhahabu ili kutumia na binti yangu mdogo Elizabeth wakati wa wakati wa ibada. Ilichapishwa awali mwaka 1965, na nilivutiwa na vielelezo vya kweli vilivyokumbusha vile nilivyokuwa naviona katika shule ya Jumapili. Biblia hiyo haikuwa tafsiri maalum bali ilikuwa ni paraphrase ya matukio teule kutoka kwa Maandiko. Nilipofika kwenye sehemu iliyoitwa, “Kaini na Abeli, Wana wa Adamu,” niliisoma,Baada ya hayo [wakati Mungu alipomwekea Kaini alama], Kaini akaenda kutoka mbele za Bwana, na akaishi katika nchi ya Nodi, upande wa mashariki wa Edeni.Na baadaye katika nchi ya Nodi, Kaini akachukua mke na akamzaa mwana ambaye aliitwa Henoki.Akaunti hii ya paraphrase ya Maandiko inaonyesha dhana potofu sana inayohusiana na wapi Kaini alipata mke wake. Wakristo wengi wamefundishwa kuwa Kaini alienda Nodi, alipata mke, akaoa, na akapata mwana. Lakini ikiwa Adamu na Eva walikuwa watu wawili tu ambao Mungu aliwaumba, watu wa Nodi walitoka wapi?Biblia Inasema Nini?Kwanza, hebu tusome maneno halisi ya Mwanzo 4:16–17, ambayo Biblia ya Watoto ya Dhahabu ilijaribu kupunguza:Kisha Kaini akaenda zake kutoka mbele za Bwana, akakaa katika nchi ya Nodi, mashariki mwa Edeni. Kaini akamjua mkewe, naye akapata mimba akamzaa Henoki. Alipojenga mji, aliuita jina la mji huo kwa jina la mwanawe, Henoki.Biblia haisemi kuwa Kaini alienda Nodi na baadaye alipata mke huko. Badala yake, maelezo ya Maandiko ni kwamba tayari alikuwa na mke alipokwenda Nodi. Tukio lililofanyika Nodi ni kwamba alimjua mkewe—alikuwa na uhusiano wa ndoa naye—na alipata mimba na kuzaa mwana.Ikiwa Kaini hakuoa mtu aliyeishi katika nchi ya Nodi, bado tuna swali, \"Kaini alipata wapi mke wake?\" au \"Kaini alioa nani?\" Tena, tunahitaji kuangalia Maandiko kwa jibu.Katika Mwanzo 2:7, tunasoma juu ya uumbaji wa Adamu, “Kisha Bwana Mungu akamfanya mtu kutoka mavumbi ya ardhi na akampulizia puani pumzi ya uhai, na mtu akawa nafsi hai.”Mwanzo 2:21–22 inasimulia uumbaji wa Eva, “Basi Bwana Mungu akamleta usingizi mzito Adamu, naye Adamu akalala usingizi; akachukua ubavu wake mmoja, kisha akaufunga mwili mahali pake. Na ule ubavu Bwana Mungu aliouchukua katika Adamu akaufanya mwanamke, akamleta kwa Adamu.”Na katika Mwanzo 1:28, tunasoma amri ya Mungu kwa Adamu na Eva, “Mungu akawabarikia, Mungu akawaambia, Zaeni, mkaongezeke, mkaijaze dunia na kuitiisha.”Mwanzo 5:4 inafanya wazi kuwa Adamu na Eva walikuwa na wana na binti wengi.Mungu aliwaumba watu wawili tu, Adamu na Eva, na aliwaambia wapate watoto wengi—“Ijazeni dunia!” Maandiko yanataja majina ya watoto watatu tu wa Adamu na Eva (Kaini, Abeli, na Sethi). Hata hivyo, Mwanzo 5:4 inafanya wazi kuwa walikuwa na wana na binti wengi:Siku za Adamu baada ya kumzaa Sethi zilikuwa miaka mia nane; na alikuwa na wana na binti wengine.Zaidi ya hayo, Mwanzo 3:20 inasema, Adamu akamwita mkewe jina lake Eva; kwa kuwa ndiye mama wa wote walio hai.Maandiko yanaweka wazi kwamba kila mwanadamu anazaliwa kutoka kwa Adamu na Eva. Ingawa ni kawaida kuainisha watu katika “rangi” kulingana na rangi ya ngozi, umbo la macho, na kadhalika, kwa kweli kuna jamii moja tu.Kwa hivyo, kwa kuwa sisi ni \"damu moja\" inayotokana na Adamu na Eva, mtu pekee ambaye Kaini angeweza kuoa angekuwa dada au mpwa wake.Ni kweli kwamba jamii ya wanadamu sasa inajumuisha makundi mengi ya watu. Hii ilikuwaje? Historia ya baadaye katika Mwanzo inatusaidia kuelewa kwa nini watu sasa wanaonekana tofauti sana kutoka kwa kila mmoja, ingawa wote walitoka kwa watu wawili tu.Uzao wa Adamu na Eva uliongezeka na kuijaza dunia kwa takriban miaka 1,500 kabla ya gharika ya Nuhu. Wakati huo, tukio muhimu lilitokea katika vinasaba vya binadamu: idadi ya watu ilipunguzwa hadi familia ya Nuhu ya watu wanane waliokuwa kwenye safina. Baada ya gharika, jamii ya wanadamu iliongezeka tena, lakini kwa kutotii Mungu, hawakujaza dunia. Hivyo, Mungu aliwahukumu kwa kuchanganya lugha zao kwenye mnara wa Babeli, na kutoka hapo, wakahamia, wakijaza dunia, kama Mungu alivyokusudia. Watu walipojitenga katika vikundi tofauti ulimwenguni, tabia fulani za mwili zilitawala, kama vile ngozi nyeusi Afrika na macho yenye umbo la mlozi Asia.Licha ya utofauti wa sifa za mwili tunaouona leo, Biblia (na sayansi ya vinasaba) inathibitisha kwamba sisi sote ni jamii moja. Kama Matendo 17:26 inavyosema, “Naye alifanya kila taifa la wanadamu kutoka kwa mtu mmoja kuishi juu ya uso wa dunia yote, na akaweka nyakati zao na mipaka ya makao yao.”Je, Unaweza Kuoa Jamaa Yako?Majibu ya haraka kwa Kaini kuoa dada yake au mpwa wake ni mshtuko au kuchukizwa. Leo, kuoa jamaa wa karibu kunaitwa uzinzi. Hata hivyo, takriban miaka 6,000 iliyopita, Mungu hakukataza ndoa kati ya jamaa wa karibu. Kwa nini?Adamu na Eva waliumbwa wakamilifu. Haikuwa mpaka baada ya kuanguka kwamba mateso na kifo vilivyoathiri wanadamu na kila kiumbe hai kingine. Jambo moja la mateso haya lingekuwa mabadiliko katika DNA yanayosababisha magonjwa. Kwa kuwa Adamu na Eva waliumbwa wakamilifu kijenetiki, watoto wao wangekuwa na mabadiliko machache. Mabadiliko katika vizazi vinavyofuata yangeendelea kuongezeka na kujilimbikiza. Hatimaye, ikawa hatari sana kuoa jamaa wa karibu kwa sababu ya uwezekano mkubwa wa ugonjwa wa kurithi.Wakati wa Musa, takriban miaka 2,500 baada ya uumbaji, Mungu alipiga marufuku ndoa kati ya jamaa wa karibu (Mambo ya Walawi 18:6–18). Inaonekana kwamba sababu moja ilikuwa ni afya. Ingawa Waisraeli hawakujua chochote kuhusu DNA, Mungu alijua, na alijua jamaa wa karibu walikuwa na uwezekano wa kuwa na mabadiliko sawa. Kwa kuwa magonjwa mengi hutokea tu wakati mtoto anapokuwa na nakala mbili za mabadiliko sawa (moja kutoka kwa mama na moja kutoka kwa baba), ndoa kati ya jamaa wa karibu ingeathiri Waisraeli. Hii ni moja ya sababu ndoa kama hizo zimepigwa marufuku leo—kuzuia magonjwa yanayoweza kuwapata watoto wa aina hii ya ndoa.Jinsi Jibu la Swali Hili Linavyoathiri Injili?Mara nyingi nimesikia Wakristo wakisema kwamba haijalishi kama Mwanzo unatoa historia ya kweli, kama ndoa ya Kaini. Uumbaji ni suala la pembeni, sio fundisho kuu, na jambo muhimu zaidi ni “kumtumaini Yesu.” Ingawa nakubaliana kabisa kwamba injili ndiyo ujumbe wetu mkuu, watu lazima waitegemee Biblia ili kujua injili ni nini. Ikiwa Biblia inayohusisha injili si sahihi na ya kweli katika Mwanzo, basi tunajuaje kama inasema ukweli kuhusu Yesu Kristo?Zaidi ya hayo, historia ya uzao wa Adamu katika Mwanzo ni msingi wa kuelewa jinsi injili inavyotumika kwa watu wote. Kwa sababu watu wote ni wazao wa Adamu na Eva, watu wote ni wenye dhambi (Warumi 3:23, 5:12). Kristo alikufa na kufufuka ili kuwakomboa uzao wa Adamu (Warumi 5:15, 17; 1 Wakorintho 15:21–22, 45). Ikiwa Kaini alioa mtu mwingine zaidi ya uzao wa Adamu na Eva, hiyo ingepingana na mafundisho ya wazi ya Maandiko, sio tu katika Mwanzo bali pia jinsi yanavyohusiana na injili. Ikiwa kuna jamii zingine, basi injili haiwezi kuwa kwa watu wote (1 Timotheo 2:4). Haiwezi—injili inategemea kwa sehemu jibu sahihi la kibiblia kuhusu wapi Kaini alipata mke wake. Kwa hivyo, si suala la pembeni tu, ni sehemu ya suala kuu!Petro anatunasihi tuwe tayari kila mara kutoa jibu kwa tumaini tulilo nalo (1 Petro 3:15). Historia katika Mwanzo, ikijumuisha utambulisho wa mke wa Kaini, ni muhimu kwa kuelewa kwamba sisi sote ni wenye dhambi na tunahitaji msamaha na wokovu unaotolewa kupitia Yesu Kristo.Dr. Maxwell Shimba ni rais wa Taasisi ya Theolojia ya Shimba",

In the Arabic Bible, the name is يوحنا (Yuhanna) and not Yahya, the fake name given by Muslims. You can verify this here:Arabic BibleTo test this truth, today I ask Muslims a simple question:Matthew 21:25\"The baptism of John, where was it from? From heaven or from men?\" They reasoned among themselves, saying, \"If we say, 'From heaven,' He will say to us, 'Why then did you not believe him?'\"QUESTION:Where did the baptism of John come from?I would like Muslims to answer me with verses and not just their own words.If the baptism of \"Yahya\" came from the Great God, why aren’t you Muslims baptized?If it came from men, why isn’t there a verse in the Quran that rejects the baptism of \"John\"?If it came from men, why was Jesus baptized?If there is no verse in the Quran that talks about baptism, then \"Yahya\" is not the same as \"يوحنا (Yuhanna)\" John in the Bible, and the Yahya in the Quran is fake and was fabricated by Muhammad.The Bible says, “Or do you not know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death? We were therefore buried with Him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.” (Romans 6:3-4).In Christian baptism, the act of being immersed in water symbolizes being buried with Christ. The act of coming out of the water symbolizes being resurrected with Christ.Shalom,Max Shimba, servant of Jesus Christ, the Great God and our Savior.Titus 2:13",

And Allah spoke to Moses directly.\"This means that Muhammad knew very little about the Prophets, i.e., only about 0.0002% of them. This is also the understanding of all Muslims regarding Prophets. However, Allah S.W directed Muhammad on where to get more light by saying:[YUNUS – 94]\"So if you are in doubt, [O Muhammad], about that which We have revealed to you, then ask those who have been reading the Scripture before you. The truth has certainly come to you from your Lord, so never be among the doubters.\"So, concerning the Prophets, almost all the Prophets narrated to Muhammad are found in the Bible. As we saw in the first part of our topic today, we inform Muslims about Paul’s prophethood.If you read the Quran carefully, you will find that the story of Paul is well described.Examine this verse:[YA-SIN – 13-14]\"And present to them an example: the people of the city, when the messengers came to it—When We sent to them two but they denied them, so We strengthened them with a third, and they said, 'Indeed, we are messengers to you.'\"This verse tells the story of Allah's messengers. Commentators and scholars like Sheikh Balwani and Yusuf Ali have interpreted this verse and said that the city to which the messengers were sent is Antioch.Ibn Kathir, in his commentary, states that the messengers were John, Simon, and Paul.Here, I quote Ibn Kathir:\"It is narrated by Ibn Jurayj from Wahb bin Sulayman, transmitted by Shu’ayb Al-Jaba’i, 'The names of the first two messengers sent were Simon and John, and the name of the third was Paul. The city was Antioch.' They said (to the people of the city), 'Indeed, we are sent to you as messengers,' meaning 'Messengers from Allah who created you and commands you to worship Him alone and not associate any partners with Him.' Qatada said they were messengers of Jesus, son of Mary (a.s), sent to the people of Antioch. They said, 'You are but human beings like us... How can you receive revelation when you are human like us? Why do we not receive revelation like you?' This was the attitude of the people of other nations who said, 'We do not believe,' as Allah tells us in Surah 64:6: 'That was because their messengers used to come to them with clear proofs, but they said, \"Shall mere men guide us!\" So they disbelieved and turned away. And Allah was in no need of them.'\"Thus, we see that the argument against Paul is a recent invention. Muslims, scholars, and early ulama did not have this argument against Paul.2. PAUL'S PROPHETHOOD ACCORDING TO THE HADITHAfter seeing the evidence from the Holy Scriptures about the prophethood of Paul, let’s turn to the hadiths of Prophet Muhammad. Why should we turn to hadith? Because of the advice given by Allah S.W within the Quran itself:[AN-NISAAI – 59]\"O you who have believed, obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you. And if you disagree over anything, refer it to Allah and the Messenger, if you should believe in Allah and the Last Day. That is the best [way] and best in result.\"In a book called SIRAT NABAWIYA, written by Ibn Hisham, a student of Ibn Ishak, in the fourth volume of that book, page 140, Muhammad lists the names of the disciples of Jesus. He divides them into two groups: those who followed Jesus during His life and those who followed after He ascended. Muhammad describes each of the disciples and where they were sent; concerning Paul, he states that Paul was sent to Rome.Here, I quote Ibn Hisham:أسماء رسل عيسى عليه السلام\"Amesema ibh Is-hak: walikuwa miongoni mwa wanafunzi wa Yesu (amani iwe juu yake) wale waliomfuata wale waliokuwa baada yake duniani: Petro Mwanafunzi wa Yesu, na pamoja naye alikuwepo Paulo miongoni mwa wafuasi, Paulo hakuwa miongoni mwa wale wanafunzi wa Yesu. Naye (Paulo) alitumwa Rumi. Na Andrea naye alitumwa katika nchi ambayo wakazi wake wanakula watu. Na Tomaso alitumwa katika nchi ya Babeli katika nchi za mashariki. Na Philipo alitumwa katika nchi pande za Afrika, na Yohana alitumwa Efeso na Yakobo alitumwa Yerusalemu na Batholomeo alitumwa Uarabuni katika nchi ya Hijaz. Na Simoni alitumwa Baribari.\"Majina ya Mitume wa Yesu Masihi:“Amesema ibn Is-hak: walikuwa miongoni mwa wanafunzi wa Yesu (amani iwe juu yake) wale waliomfuata wale waliokuwa baada yake duniani: Petro Mwanafunzi wa Yesu, na pamoja naye alikuwepo Paulo miongoni mwa wafuasi, Paulo hakuwa miongoni mwa wale wanafunzi wa Yesu. Naye (Paulo) alitumwa Rumi. Na Andrea naye alitumwa katika nchi ambayo wakazi wake wanakula watu. Na Tomaso alitumwa katika nchi ya Babeli katika nchi za mashariki. Na Philipo alitumwa katika nchi pande za Afrika, na Yohana alitumwa Efeso na Yakobo alitumwa Yerusalemu na Batholomeo alitumwa Uarabuni katika nchi ya Hijaz. Na Simoni alitumwa Baribari.”It is surprising to see that despite such significant evidence, today’s Muslims (especially activists) have chosen to ignore this truth and start misleading people, either intentionally or out of ignorance. The question is: for whose benefit are they doing this?My Muslim friend, I want to warn you that Satan is cunning and will always come with deception, using false teachers. Some will come as defenders of the faith, but they are the greatest destroyers of the faith.Allah S.W says in the Quran to tell Muslims:[AL-BAQARA – 136]\"Say: We have believed in Allah and what has been revealed to us and what was revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Descendants, and what was given to Moses and Jesus, and what was given to the prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and we are Muslims [in submission] to Him.\"You see that Allah S.W has instructed Muslims not only to believe in the 25 mentioned Prophets in the Quran but also to believe in what was revealed to the descendants of Jacob. PAUL IS ALSO A DESCENDANT OF THE PROPHET JACOB. But not only that, Allah S.W has asked Muslims to believe in what was revealed to \"other prophets.\" PAUL IS ALSO AMONG THE OTHER PROPHETS.Therefore, rejecting Paul is to reject the faith, reject the Quran, and ultimately reject Allah Himself. AND THIS IS EXTREME UNBELIEF.Is there any hadith where the Prophet warned his companions or Muslims in general about Paul’s teachings?No, instead, we see Muhammad himself quoting Paul's teachings and calling it a message from Allah:“It is narrated by Abu Huraira, the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w) said; Allah said, ‘I have prepared for My righteous servants what no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and no human heart has conceived.’”Thus, we see that the argument against Paul’s prophethood has no foundation in the teachings of the Holy Scriptures and is a distortion by self-seeking religious teachers.Shalom,Max Shimba Ministries Org",

However, when we read God's books and history, there is not a single part where we read that Ishmael, whose mother was African, had any relationship with Muhammad of Islam.Let's read this evidence:Genesis 21:14-21 (KJV)14 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.15 And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.16 And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lifted up her voice, and wept.17 And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? Fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.18 Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation.19 And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.20 And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.21 And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.In Genesis 21:21, we learn that Ishmael's wife was from Africa and was not an Arab.Dear brothers and sisters, ISLAM IS A MADE-UP RELIGION.It has no foundation beyond imitating Christianity and Judaism.ISLAM CANNOT BE TAUGHT WITHOUT CHRISTIANITY. ALLAH CANNOT EXIST WITHOUT JEHOVAH. MUHAMMAD CANNOT CALL HIMSELF A PROPHET WITHOUT THE EXISTENCE OF JESUS.THE ISHMAEL OF ISLAM CANNOT BE TAUGHT WITHOUT MUSLIMS STEALING AND USING THE COMPLETE AND DOUBTLESS BIBLE.Moreover, there is no verifiable evidence that Ishmael married a Jurhumite; the Holy Bible assures us that Ishmael married a woman from Egypt, Africa.Let's read further evidence here:Genesis 25:12-18 (KJV)12 Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham:13 And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,14 And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,15 Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:16 These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.17 And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.18 And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his brethren.We read that Ishmael's children lived on the border of Egypt, not in the Arabian Peninsula or Saudi Arabia.So why do Muslims cling to Ishmael?Muslims cry over Ishmael to establish a connection to Abraham, who is the father of Isaac. Muhammad knew that if he claimed no kinship with Abraham, no one would follow his fabricated religion of Islam.ALLAH NEVER SPOKE TO ISHMAEL EVEN ONCEMUSLIMS HAVE BEEN DEFENDING ISHMAEL USING THE BIBLE!THERE IS NO VERSE WHERE ALLAH SAYS ISHMAEL IS A MUSLIM.They further confirm to us that the Quran is a book full of doubt!There is no part of the Quran that shows Allah spoke to Ishmael! Nor is there any part of that book that says Allah made him a great nation and that he would have twelve princes!THERE IS NO PART OF THE BIBLE THAT SHOWS THAT MUHAMMAD CAME FROM ISHMAEL'S LINEAGE, LET ALONE HIS NAME!SINCE THEY DEPEND ON THE BIBLE, LET THEM TELL US BETWEEN ISAAC AND ISHMAEL WHO WAS OFFERED BY ABRAHAM AS A BURNT SACRIFICE? (Genesis 22:1-18)WITHOUT SATAN DISTORTING THE SCRIPTURES OF THE BIBLE, ISLAM CANNOT BE PREACHED!!THUS, ISLAM IS A DEPENDENT RELIGION.Now, Muslims, answer the following questions:Provide historical proof before Muhammad's birth that Ishmael was a Muslim.Provide evidence that existed before the Quran and Muhammad that Ishmael was a Muslim.Provide evidence of Allah speaking to Ishmael.Why do Muslims use a Bible they do not believe in to defend Ishmael?IF YOU PROVIDE ME ANSWERS WITH QURANIC VERSES AND WITHOUT INSULTS, I WILL CONVERT TO ISLAM TODAY.It is I, Dr. Max Shimba, a servant of Jesus Christ, the Great God.For Max Shimba Ministries Org.www.maxshimbaministries.comOther references:The Encyclopedia of Religion, Vol. 7, pg. 296 where the connection between the Midianites and the Ishmaelites is noted.The Shorter Encyclopedia of Islam, pgs. 178-179.A Popular Dictionary of Islam, p. 127.Halabieh, I, page 93 ; comments on Ibn Hisham, page mHalabieh I, page 36Masudi, Muruj al-Thahab, Beirut-Lebanon, 1991, II, pages 280-282Halabieh, I, page 35, 36Tarikh al-Tabari, I , page 127Tarikh al-Tabari, I, page 127Tarikh al-Tabari, I, page 127Diwan Ummiah bin Abi al-Salt, ( Beirut-1938), page 58Tarikh al-Tabari, I, page 128Tarikh al-Tabari, I, page 128Tarikh al-Tabari, I, page 516K.A.

NO WONDER THE QURAN DECLARES MUSLIMS AS INFIDELSTHAT'S WHY I SAY THAT THIS QURAN THAT DECLARES MUSLIMS AS INFIDELS IS NOT THE BOOK OF GODDear reader,Without wasting time, let's start with a verse from the Quran that says Allah used to abrogate His own verses. This is a huge problem.This habit of abrogating and changing verses is what is called infidelity. The word \"kafir\" means to alter the truth, or hide the truth, or tell lies, or falsely attribute lies to God, or reject God's instructions that came before the Quran and before Muhammad's birth.NOW LET'S READ ABOUT THIS INFIDEL HABIT OF ALLAH IN ISLAMQuran 2:106:\"Any revelation We abrogate or cause to be forgotten, We bring one better than it or similar to it. Do you not know that Allah has power over all things?\"Why was Allah abrogating His verses? How can we trust a Quran that was abrogated? That is why I say this altered Quran is what turns Muslims into infidels.The famous Islamic writer Caliph Uthman wrote the Quran and burned the verses he was not pleased with! (Sahih Bukhari 6:61:510)He did not just burn the verses, but entire chapters of the Quran were lost and forgotten. (Sahih Muslim 5:2286)Moreover, some verses were deliberately abrogated. (Bukhari 6:61:527).Muhammad instructed Muslims to learn Islam from the Quran of Ubai and not the one written by Zayd Ibn Thabit (which is the modern one) (Bukhari 6:61:521).Ibn Sad (Kitab al-Tabaqat al-Kabir vol.2 p.444)says that the writings of Zayd Ibn Thabit's Quran were different from Muhammad's. Therefore, believers have been misled by memorizing this modern Quran, and this Quran is what turns Muslims into infidels.Jami At-Tirmidhi 3104also says the current Quran is fake - by Zayd Ibn Thabit.In making many corrections to the Quran, people came up with different copies of the Quran (Jami at-Tirmidhi 3104), causing confusion among Muhammad's followers because they were different.Ibn Masood's Quran had 111 chapters, Ubay's had 116 chapters, and Zayd's Quran (which is the one in use now) has 114 chapters. See (Ibn Daud, Kitab al-Masahif).Even those declared fake were not preserved because a goat ate parts of their verses (Sunan Ibn Majah 1934/1944).So no one wrote the Quran until some of those who had memorized Muhammad's teachings died, and there was fear that the remaining verses would be lost entirely (Bukhari z6:61:509).This is how Zayd Ibn Thabit came to write the Quran we have today from the testimonies of the remaining memorizers (just a few pages from 23 years of revelation).SENSITIVE QUESTIONS ARISE HERE:Why was Allah abrogating Quranic verses?Why did Caliph Uthman burn Quranic verses?Why do Muslims hide the truth about their religion?CONSIDER THESE QUESTIONS AND TAKE ACTION!REJECT THE QURAN THAT MAKES YOU AN INFIDEL.Max Shimba Ministries Org",

Furthermore, many Muslims reject translations of the Qur'an in other languages. Translations are not considered legitimate versions of the Qur'an, which exists only in Arabic.That is why, when Muslims pray to Muhammad, they use Arabic worldwide. So, what language does Allah speak if not Arabic?And the Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said:\"Whoever reads a letter from the Book of Allah will be credited with a good deed, and a good deed is worth ten times its value. I do not say that Alif-Laam-Meem (A.L.M.) is a letter, but Alif is a letter, Laam is a letter, and Meem is a letter.\" [At-Tirmidhi, and he said it is a Hasan Sahih Hadith].The only language recognized by Allah along with His Prophet is Arabic, and this is the language Allah uses where He is.What language does Allah use to speak with Hell if not Arabic?All demons and jinn have Arabic names, and the language they used to communicate with Muhammad when reciting the Qur'an was Arabic. This is the language of demons and jinn.So, if all demons/jinn are thrown into Hell, what language will they use if not Arabic?AL-KASHIF, VOLUME TWENTY-SIX, Verses 29 – 32:Jinn listen to the Qur'an. Above, we read that the Qur'an was revealed in Arabic, thus these jinn/demons listened to the Qur'an in Arabic.Now, let's read a Sahih Hadith: Bukhari :: Book 6 :: Volume 60 :: Hadith 371 Narrated Anas: The Prophet of Allah said, \"People will be thrown into Hell (Hellfire), and as a result, Hell will say, 'Are there any more?' (50:30) until Allah places His foot over it, and Hell will say, 'Qati! Qati!' (Enough, enough!).\"The words \"Enough, enough\" - \"Qati Qati! Qati! Qati!\" - are in Arabic. So, even Hell speaks Arabic.Christians who are aware cannot be Muslims because even their language is the language of Hell.Shalom.Dr. Max Shimba, servant of Jesus Christ, the Great God. Titus 2:13",

'Go to the Christians to learn and become a Christian.' He refused because the jinn within him forbade him from seeking salvation, that is, becoming a Christian.Gabriel's message could not enter Muhammad because the jinn had blocked every part. In his spirit, there were 40,000 jinn preventing him from receiving God's message and words; in his mind, there were 30,000 jinn, and in his eyes, there were 10,000 jinn. After being controlled in these parts, Muhammad was not ready to listen to any message from God.\"\"SAVE US FROM THE EVIL ONE, THE WORLD OF JINN,\" JOSHUA KANANI CHABU - GRADUATED FROM AL-AZHAR UNIVERSITY CAIRO, p. 28What about believers being possessed by jinn?According to the same book, Muslim women believers are possessed by these jinn when they go to the mosque. On page 34, it explains one of the tasks of a jinn named Arafu.It is written:\"The task of pleasing womenMuslim women who hold firmly to their Islamic faith can be possessed by a 'male jinn' who gives them great pleasure, to the extent that they may not desire their husbands for up to 30 days. This jinn is one of those that entered during their conversion to Islam. When a woman prays in the mosque, she sits without underwear. This tradition has ancient origins and its own narratives, for example, Aisha spoke of it. The father respects a woman who has been possessed by a jinn. There are also female jinn for pleasing men.\"Muhammad s.a.w and Muslims lived/live after the time of Jesus Christ (570-632 AD).When Jesus Christ was on earth, one of the missions He gave His apostles was to cast out demons (evil spirits). It is written:“Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy, drive out demons; freely you have received, freely give.” (Matthew 10:8)It is also written:\"1 They went across the lake to the region of the Gerasenes.2 When Jesus got out of the boat, a man with an impure spirit came from the tombs to meet him.3 This man lived in the tombs, and no one could bind him anymore, not even with a chain.4 For he had often been chained hand and foot, but he tore the chains apart and broke the irons on his feet. No one was strong enough to subdue him.5 Night and day among the tombs and in the hills he would cry out and cut himself with stones.6 When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell on his knees in front of him.7 He shouted at the top of his voice, 'What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? In God’s name don’t torture me!'8 For Jesus had said to him, 'Come out of this man, you impure spirit!'9 Then Jesus asked him, 'What is your name?' 'My name is Legion,' he replied, 'for we are many.'10 And he begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of the area.11 A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside.12 The demons begged Jesus, 'Send us among the pigs; allow us to go into them.'13 He gave them permission, and the impure spirits came out and went into the pigs. The herd, about two thousand in number, rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned.” (Mark 5:1-13)I wonder, why did Muhammad s.a.w continue to suffer from those 80,000 jinn until he died instead of going to Christians to be prayed for and freed from them?Moreover, why do Muslim women reject Jesus while they are at risk of being possessed by jinn? When they remove their underwear in the mosque, do they know who they are undressing for?I wonder greatly, and I encourage you to ponder deeply about this situation.Shalom,Max Shimba Ministries Org.",

This is not true. Because in Arabic, Jesus is called Yasu’a, not Isa. It should be noted that the Bible existed on earth approximately 1500 years before the Qur’an. (The Qur’an is a post-Bible book).Our argument for Muslims is who changed the name Yasu’a to Isa? The name Yasu’a is more similar to the name Yehoshua, which is in Hebrew, and in Greek, the language used to write the New Testament, He is called Iesous (pronounced Jesus). The translation of these words into Swahili is Savior.We read this in Matthew 1:21-23, “And she will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins.” All this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, “Behold, the virgin shall be with child and bear a Son, and they shall call His name Immanuel,” which is translated, “God with us.”Our question is, is Isa a.s. also the Savior and Immanuel as Jesus Christ is?Another point to consider when examining their differences is about their mothers. Jesus Christ’s mother is Mary, who comes from the tribe of Judah. We read this in Genesis 49:10, “The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh comes; and to Him shall be the obedience of the people.”This prophecy was fulfilled in Jesus Christ. We read this in Hebrews 7:14, “For it is evident that our Lord arose from Judah, of which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood.”But when we read about Isa, his mother is from the family of Imran, who is the father of Aaron, Miriam, and Moses. We read this in Suratul Al-Maryam 19:28, “O sister of Aaron! Your father was not a man of evil, nor was your mother unchaste.”The interpretation of this verse 19:28 in the Qur’an, translation by King Fahd, p. 405, reads, “This Harun (Aaron) is not the brother of Musa (Moses), but he was another pious man at the time of Maryam (Mary).”Translation: “This Aaron is not the brother of Moses but was another pious man who lived during the time of Mary.”According to the Bible, Aaron is the son of Amram and their mother is named Jochebed, and they had three children: Aaron, Miriam, and their younger brother Moses. We read this in Numbers 26:59, “The name of Amram’s wife was Jochebed, a descendant of Levi, who was born to the Levites in Egypt; and to Amram she bore Aaron, Moses, and their sister Miriam.”Another difference is their creation:ISA WAS CREATED. Qur’an Suratul Imran, 3:59, “Indeed, the example of Jesus to Allah is like that of Adam. He created him from dust; then He said to him, 'Be,' and he was.”But when we read aboutJESUS, HE WAS NOT CREATED BUT IS THE WORD OF GOD.John 1:1,14, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God… And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us…”Micah 5:2, “But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of you shall come forth to Me the One to be Ruler in Israel, whose goings forth are from of old, from everlasting.”John 8:58, “Jesus said to them, 'Most assuredly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I AM.'”Furthermore, the Bible informs us that He is the Creator Himself.John 1:3, “All things were made through Him, and without Him, nothing was made that was made.”Colossians 1:16-17, “For by Him all things were created that are in heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were created through Him and for Him.”(A)ISA A.S.: AFTER HIS DEPARTURE, (AS MUSLIMS BELIEVE), HE HAS NEVER APPEARED IN ANY WAY.(B)JESUS CHRIST: AFTER HIS DEPARTURE, HE APPEARED TO PAUL (SAUL).Acts 9:4, “Then he fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?' And he said, 'Who are You, Lord?' Then the Lord said, 'I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.'”(A)ISA A.S.: PROPHESIED THE COMING OF MUHAMMAD.Qur’an Suratul As-Saff, 61:6,“And (remember) when Jesus, son of Mary, said, ‘O children of Israel! I am the Messenger of Allah unto you confirming the Torah before me and giving glad tidings of a Messenger to come after me, whose name shall be Ahmad (another name for Muhammad).’ But when he came to them with clear proofs, they said, ‘This is plain magic.’”(B)JESUS CHRIST SENT THE HOLY SPIRIT ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST.John 14:26, “But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I said to you.” In Greek, He is called “Paracletos,” meaning helper or comforter.John 15:26, “But when the Helper comes, whom I shall send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father, He will testify of Me.”John 16:7, “Nevertheless, I tell you the truth. It is to your advantage that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send Him to you.”(A)ISA A.S.: HIS NAME HAS NO POWER OR SAVING ABILITY BUT IS TWO-TONED.In Al-Lu’lu’war-Marjani, Volume 1, Hadith 104, p. 64, “The Hadith of Ibn Abbas (r.a) from the Prophet (s.a.w) said, ‘I saw Moses (a.s) on the night of Al-Isra, and he was a tall man with brown curly hair like a man of the Shanua. And I saw Isa (a.s), and he was a man of medium build, inclined to redness and whiteness, with straight hair...’”(B)JESUS CHRIST: HIS NAME IS SALVATION.Acts 4:9-10,12, “If we this day are judged for a good deed done to a helpless man, by what means he has been made well, let it be known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, by Him this man stands here before you whole… Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.”Some verses in the Qur’an say Isa a.s. healed the blind. Who were these people? Can we name at least one? Jesus healed the blind Bartimaeus.Other verses say Isa a.s. raised the dead. Who were these people? Jesus raised Lazarus.The name we are given is only one name with salvation, the name of Jesus Christ. How is the name Isa a.s., which has no salvation, associated with the name Jesus Christ of Nazareth, which has salvation?Acts 16:31, “So they said, ‘Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you and your household.’”(A)ISA A.S.: HE IS NOT THE SON OF GOD.Qur’an Suratul Al-An’am, 6:101, “He is the Creator of the heavens and the earth. How could He have a son when He has no consort? He created all things, and He has knowledge of all things.”Qur’an Suratul At-Tawba (Repentance), 9:30, “The Jews say, ‘Ezra is the son of Allah,’ and the Christians say, ‘The Messiah is the son of Allah.’ That is their saying with their mouths, resembling the saying of those who disbelieved aforetime. Allah’s curse be on them: how they are deluded away from the truth!”The doctrine of the Sonship of God as taught in the Bible is not found in the teachings and beliefs of Islam; therefore, Isa a.s. is not the Son of God.(B)JESUS CHRIST: HE IS THE SON OF GOD.Luke 1:30-31,35, “Then the angel said to her, ‘Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bring forth a Son, and shall call His name Jesus.’ The angel answered and said to her, ‘The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Highest will overshadow you; therefore, also, that Holy One who is to be born will be called the Son of God.’”Therefore, Isa is not the Son of God, but Jesus is the Son of God. Therefore, Jesus is not Isa.(A)ISA A.S.: HE IS NOT GOD INCARNATE.Suratul Al-Maidah (The Table Spread), 5:72-73, “Certainly they disbelieve who say: ‘Allah is the Messiah, the son of Mary.’ But the Messiah said: ‘O Children of Israel! Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.’ Whoever joins other gods with Allah, Allah will forbid him the Garden, and the Fire will be his abode. And for the wrongdoers, there will be no helpers. Surely, disbelievers are those who said: ‘Allah is the third of the three (in a Trinity).’ But there is no deity except One Allah. If they do not desist from what they are saying, surely a painful punishment will befall the disbelievers among them.”(B)JESUS: HE IS THE WORD OF GOD INCARNATE.John 1:1,14, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God… And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us…”(A)ISA A.S.: HE WAS NEITHER CRUCIFIED NOR KILLED.Qur’an Suratul An-Nisaa (The Women) 4:157-158, “And because of their saying (in boast), ‘We killed Messiah Jesus, son of Mary, the Messenger of Allah,’ but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but the resemblance of Jesus was put over another man (and they killed that man), and those who differ therein are full of doubts. They have no certain knowledge; they follow nothing but conjecture. For surely; they killed him not. But Allah raised him up unto Himself. And Allah is Ever All-Powerful, All-Wise.”(B)JESUS CHRIST: HE WAS CRUCIFIED ON THE CROSS.John 19:18,31,33, “There they crucified Him, and with Him two others, one on either side, and Jesus in the center… Therefore, because it was the Preparation Day, that the bodies should not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away… But when they came to Jesus and saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs.”(A)ISA A.S.: HE DOES NOT DESERVE TO BE WORSHIPPED BY ANY HUMAN.Qur’an, Suratul Al-Maidah, 5:116, “And [beware the Day] when Allah will say, ‘O Jesus, son of Mary, did you say to the people, ‘Take me and my mother as deities besides Allah?’’ He will say, ‘Exalted are You! It was not for me to say that to which I have no right. If I had said it, You would have known it. You know what is within myself, and I do not know what is within Yourself. Indeed, it is You who is Knower of the unseen.’”(B)JESUS DESERVES TO BE WORSHIPPED BY HUMANS AND ANGELS.Matthew 2:2, “Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we have seen His star in the East and have come to worship Him.”John 9:35-38, “Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when He had found him, He said to him, ‘Do you believe in the Son of God?’ He answered and said, ‘Who is He, Lord, that I may believe in Him?’ And Jesus said to him, ‘You have both seen Him and it is He who is talking with you.’ Then he said, ‘Lord, I believe!’ And he worshiped Him.”Philippians 2:10-11, “That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, and of those on earth, and of those under the earth, and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.”Hebrews 1:6, “But when He again brings the firstborn into the world, He says: ‘Let all the angels of God worship Him.’”(A)ISA DOES NOT DESERVE TO BE AN INTERCESSOR FOR PEOPLE TO GOD.Sahih Al-Bukhari, vol.6, Hadith no. 3, The Noble Qur’an, English Translation, p. 8, “…….Go to Musa, the servant of Allah who spoke to Allah directly and was given the Torah. So they will go to him and he will say, ‘I am not fit for this task of intercession,’ and he will mention his mistake of killing a person who was not a killer, and so he will feel ashamed before his Lord and will say, ‘Go to Isa, the servant of Allah, His Messenger, His Word and a soul created by Him.’ Isa will say, ‘I am not fit for the task of intercession…’”(B)JESUS DESERVES TO BE AN INTERCESSOR FOR HUMANS TO GOD.1 Timothy 2:5, “For there is one God and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus.”Hebrews 7:24-25, “But He, because He continues forever, has an unchangeable priesthood. Therefore He is also able to save to the uttermost those who come to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them.”(A)ISA IS JUST ANOTHER PROPHET LIKE OTHERS.Qur’an Suratul Baqarah (The Cow), 2:136, “Say (O Muslims): ‘We believe in Allah and that which has been sent down to us and that which has been sent down to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and to Al-Asbat (the twelve sons of Jacob), and that which has been given to Moses and Jesus, and that which has been given to the Prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and to Him we have submitted.’”(B)JESUS IS ABOVE ALL THINGS.Ephesians 1:20-23, “Which He worked in Christ when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality and power and might and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in that which is to come. And He put all things under His feet and gave Him to be head over all things to the church, which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all.”(A)ISA, WHEN HE RETURNS, WILL MARRY AND HAVE CHILDREN.Mishkat Al-Masabih, vol. 2, p. 1159, Sahih Muslim, vol. 1, p. 92, “When Isa returns, he will live for forty years, during which he will marry and have children, and will perform the pilgrimage.”(B)WHEN JESUS RETURNS, HE WILL COME TO TAKE UP THE CHURCH, WHICH IS THE BRIDE.Ephesians 5:25-26, 32-33, “Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself for her, that He might sanctify and cleanse her with the washing of water by the word… This is a great mystery, but I speak concerning Christ and the church. Nevertheless let each one of you in particular so love his own wife as himself, and let the wife see that she respects her husband.”Revelation 19:7, “Let us be glad and rejoice and give Him glory, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready.”(A)ISA WILL DIE AFTER LIVING FOR FORTY YEARS.Mishkat Al-Masabih, vol. 2, p. 1159, Sunan Abu Dawud, Hadith 4310, Sahih Muslim, vol.1, p. 92, “When Isa returns, he will abolish all religions except Islam. He will destroy the Antichrist, and he will live on earth for forty years and then die. After his death, he will be buried next to Muhammad.”(B)JESUS, AFTER HIS RESURRECTION, IS ALIVE FOREVERMORE AND DOES NOT DIE AGAIN.Romans 6:9, “Knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, dies no more. Death no longer has dominion over Him.”Hebrews 7:24-25, “But He, because He continues forever, has an unchangeable priesthood. Therefore He is also able to save to the uttermost those who come to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them.”Revelation 1:17-18, “And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet as dead. But He laid His right hand on me, saying to me, ‘Do not be afraid; I am the First and the Last. I am He who lives, and was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore. Amen. And I have the keys of Hades and of Death.’”(A)WHEN ISA WAS BORN, A VOICE OF COMFORT CAME FROM UNDER THE GROUND.Qur’an Suratul Maryam, 19:23-24, “And the pains of childbirth drove her to the trunk of a date-palm. She said, ‘Oh, I wish I had died before this and was in oblivion, forgotten.’ Then he called her from below her, ‘Do not grieve; your Lord has provided beneath you a stream.’”Islamic teachings explain that under the ground, there is an animal that knows the verses of the Qur’an.Qur’an in Suratul Al-Naml, 27:82, “And when the Word befalls them, We will bring forth for them a creature from the earth, speaking to them, that the people were of Our verses not certain [in faith].”(B)WHEN JESUS WAS BORN, ANGELIC VOICES CAME FROM ABOVE.Luke 2:13-16, “And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying, ‘Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, goodwill toward men!’ So it was, when the angels had gone away from them into heaven, that the shepherds said to one another, ‘Let us now go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has come to pass, which the Lord has made known to us.’ And they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the Babe lying in a manger.”(A)ISA HAS NO KNOWLEDGE OF VARIOUS THINGS.In Al-Lu’lu’ war-Marjan, book 3, Hadith no. 1528, p. 883, “Hadith of Abu Huraira (r.a) from the Prophet (s.a.w) said, ‘Isa Ibn Mariam (a.s) saw a man stealing and asked him, ‘Did you steal?’ He said, ‘No, by Allah, there is no god but Him.’ Isa (a.s) said, ‘I believed in Allah, and my eye has lied to me.’”(B)JESUS KNOWS EVERYTHING.John 1:47-48, “Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward Him and said of him, ‘Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no deceit!’ Nathanael said to Him, ‘How do You know me?’ Jesus answered and said to him, ‘Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.’”John 2:24-25, “But Jesus did not commit Himself to them, because He knew all men, and had no need that anyone should testify of man, for He knew what was in man.”(A)ISA A.S.: HIS MOTHER WAS FOUND BESIDE A MOSQUE WHEN SHE RECEIVED THE NEWS OF HIS BIRTH.Qur’an Suratul Maryam, 19:16-17, “And mention in the Book, [the story of] Mary, when she withdrew from her family to a place toward the east. And she took, in seclusion from them, a screen. Then We sent to her Our angel, and he represented himself to her as a well-proportioned man.”(B)JESUS CHRIST: HIS MOTHER WAS FOUND AT HER HOME IN NAZARETH.Luke 1:26-28, “Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. The virgin’s name was Mary. And having come in, the angel said to her, ‘Rejoice, highly favored one, the Lord is with you; blessed are you among women!’”(A)THE PREGNANCY OF ISA WAS OF ONE DAY.Qur’an Suratul Maryam, 19:21-22, “[The angel] said, ‘Thus [it will be]; your Lord says, ‘It is easy for Me, and We will make him a sign to the people and a mercy from Us. And it is a matter [already] decreed.’ So she conceived him, and she withdrew with him to a remote place.”(B)THE PREGNANCY OF JESUS: THE DAYS WERE FULFILLED.Luke 2:6-7, “So it was, that while they were there, the days were completed for her to be delivered. And she brought forth her firstborn Son, and wrapped Him in swaddling cloths, and laid Him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.”Note: The sixth month mentioned in Luke 1:26 refers to the age of the pregnancy of John inside Elizabeth’s womb. Luke 1:36, “Now indeed, Elizabeth your relative has also conceived a son in her old age; and this is now the sixth month for her who was called barren.”Note: The manger mentioned here means a feeding trough for animals in a stable. In Greek (the language in which the New Testament was written), this is called “Fatne,” and in English, it is called “a manger.”WHEN ISA (A.S.) RETURNS, HE WILL BREAK THE CROSSES AND KILL THE PIGS.Mishkat Al-Masabih, vol. 3-4, p. 20, Hadith no. 753, “The Hour will not be established until the son of Maryam (Isa a.s.) descends among you as a just ruler. He will break the crosses (of the Christians in the churches) and kill the pigs, and abolish the Jizya (tax); and wealth will become so abundant that nobody will accept it.” Also, see Sahih Bukhari, vol. 3, Hadith no. 425, Al-Lu’lu’ war-Marjan, vol. 1, Hadith no. 95, p. 51, The Noble Qur’an, p. 757.(B)WHEN JESUS CHRIST RETURNS, HE WILL SEND HIS ANGELS TO GATHER THE SAINTS.Matthew 24:30-31, “Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. And He will send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they will gather together His elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.”WARNING OF JESUS CHRIST OF NAZARETHMatthew 24:24, “For false christs and false prophets will rise and show great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect.” (See also Mark 13:22)John 8:24, “Therefore I said to you that you will die in your sins; for if you do not believe that I am He, you will die in your sins.”YOU, THE ELECT, WILL YOU BE DECEIVED AND MISLED TO BELIEVE THAT INDEED ISA A.S. IS JESUS CHRIST? IF YOU BELIEVE SO, YOU WILL BE DECEIVED AND MISS THE SALVATION OF GOD!!!!!!!!!!JESUS CHRIST, HE IS IMMANUEL, WONDERFUL COUNSELOR, MIGHTY GOD, EVERLASTING FATHER, PRINCE OF PEACE!!!!

    "full_content": "The Hadith of BukhariHundreds of thousands of hadiths (narratives) claim to describe the teachings and actions of Muhammad and his close followers. Early Muslims scrutinized these hadiths to determine which among them were genuine. There are six collections of hadiths considered \"sahih\" or authentic and authoritative by Sunnis. These hadiths are regarded as nearly as important as the Quran itself. The longest collection is Sahih al-Bukhari, which contains nine volumes and 7,275 hadiths. The following points are particularly noteworthy for both Muslim and non-Muslim readers from the hadiths of the Bukhari collection. These excerpts are taken from the book \"The Translation of the Meanings of Sahih Al-Bukhari\" by Dr. Muhammad Muhsin Khan of the Islamic University of Madinah Al-Munawwara, Saudi Arabia.Muhammad Is Not Worshipped\"After that, Abu Bakr said the Tashah-hud (i.e., none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Messenger)... Abu Bakr said, 'Whoever worshipped Muhammad, Muhammad is dead, but whoever worships Allah, Allah is alive and will never die. Allah said: 'Muhammad is no more than a Messenger...'\" Bukhari, Volume 2, Book 23 (Funerals), Chapter 3, No. 333, p.188-189.However, Muslims greatly revere Muhammad. \"By Allah, whenever the Prophet of Allah spat, it would fall into the hand of one of (i.e., the companions of the Prophet) who would rub it on his face and skin; when he ordered them, they carried out his orders immediately; when he performed ablution, they almost fought for the remaining water; and when they spoke to him, they would lower their voices and would not look at him directly out of respect.\" Bukhari, Volume 3, Book 50 (Conditions), Chapter 13, No. 891, p.564-565.Prohibition of Intoxicants\"Aisha [the wife of Muhammad] narrated that the Prophet said, 'Every intoxicant is prohibited to drink.'\" Bukhari, Volume 1, Book 4 (Ablution), Chapter 75, No. 243, p.153.\"Abu Huraira narrated: 'The Prophet said, 'An adulterer, at the time he is committing illegal sexual intercourse, is not a believer; and a person, at the time of drinking an alcoholic drink, is not a believer; and a thief, at the time of stealing, is not a believer.'\" Bukhari, Volume 7, Book 69 (Drinks), Chapter 1, No. 484, p.339.Muslims are also forbidden from selling wine, idols, and pork. Sahih Muslim, Volume 3, Book 9 (Business Transactions), Chapter 621-622, No. 3835-3840, p.828-830. They are not allowed to buy, sell, or carry wine. Ibn Majah, Volume 4, Book 30 (Drinks), No. 3380-3381, p.493-494; Volume 4, Book 30, No. 3382, p.494. The selling of wine is forbidden in Bukhari, Volume 1, Book 8 (Prayer), Chapter 73, No. 449, p.267.Did Muhammad See the Moon Split in Two?\"The pagans asked the Prophet to show them a miracle, so he showed them the splitting of the moon. 'Abdullah bin Masud narrated: 'During the lifetime of the Prophet, the moon was split into two parts and on that the Prophet said, 'Bear witness (to this).'\" Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 56 (Virtues and Merits of the Prophet and His Companions), Chapter 26, No. 830, p. 533.\"Anas narrated that the people of Makkah asked Allah's Messenger to show them a miracle, and so he showed them the moon split in two.\" Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 56 (Virtues and Merits of the Prophet and His Companions), Chapter 26, No. 831, p.533.\"Ibn Abbas narrated: 'The moon was split into two parts during the lifetime of the Prophet.'\" Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 56 (Virtues and Merits of the Prophet and His Companions), Chapter 26, No. 832, p.534.Stars Should Strike the Devils?\"The creation of the stars was made for three purposes, i.e., as decorations of the sky, as missiles to hit the devils, and as signs to guide travelers. So, anyone who tries to find a different interpretation is mistaken and wastes his efforts...\" Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 54 (Beginning of Creation), Chapter 3, Commentary by Translator before No. 421, p.282.Memory of Abu Huraira\"Abu Huraira narrated: 'I said, 'O Allah's Messenger! I hear many narrations from you but I forget them.' He said, 'Spread your garment.' I did accordingly and then he moved his hands as if scooping something and emptied it in the garment and said, 'Wrap it.' I wrapped it around my body, and since then I have never forgotten a single Hadith.\" Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 56 (Virtues and Merits of the Prophet and His Companions), Chapter 27, No. 841, p.538. Also, Bukhari, Volume 9, Book 92 (Holding Fast to the Quran and Sunnah), Chapter 22, No. 452, p.332; Volume 1, Book 3 (Knowledge), Chapter 43, No. 119, p.89.Satan in Your Nose\"Abu Huraira narrated: 'The Prophet said, 'If anyone of you rouses from sleep and performs the ablution, he should wash his nose by putting water in it and then blowing it out thrice because Satan stays in the upper part of the nose all night.'\" (1) Translator's note (1) says, \"We should believe that Satan actually stays in the upper part of a person's nose, though we cannot perceive how, for this involves the unseen world about which we cannot know anything except what Allah tells us through His Messenger.\" Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 54 (Beginning of Creation), Chapter 10, No. 516, p.328.Believing Muhammad Despite the Presence of Flies\"Abu Huraira narrated: 'The Prophet said, 'If a fly falls into the drink of any one of you, he should dip it (in the drink), for one of its wings has a disease and the other has the cure for that disease.'\" Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 54 (Beginning of Creation), Chapter 16, No. 537, p.338. See also Abu Dawud, Volume 3, Book 21 (Food), No. 3835, p.1080.\"Abu Huraira narrated: 'The Prophet of Allah said, 'If a fly falls into the vessel of any one of you, let him dip it in the vessel and then throw it away, for in one of its wings there is disease and in the other there is healing (1) (antidote), i.e., treatment for that disease.\" Bukhari, Volume 7, Book 71 (Medicine), Chapter 58, No. 673, p.452-453.Translator's note (1) says, \"In the medical science, it is well known today that flies carry pathogens on some parts of their bodies as stated by the Prophet (nearly 1400 years ago when human knowledge of modern medical science was very limited.) Similarly, Allah has created microorganisms and their actions that can kill these pathogens, e.g., Penicillin Fungus can kill bacteria like Staphylococci and others. Recently, experiments have shown that flies carry both disease-causing pathogens and their antidotes. Normally, when a fly touches a liquid, it contaminates it with its pathogens, thus it must be dipped to release the antidotes to counteract the pathogens. Regarding this subject, I also wrote to my friend Dr. Muhammad M. El-SAMAHY, Head of the Hadith Department at Al-Azhar University, Cairo, Egypt, who wrote an article about this Hadith concerning medical science, stating that microbiologists have proven that there are longitudinal parasitic germs living as pathogens inside the fly's stomach, which these parasitic germs come out through the respiratory tracts of the fly, and if the fly is dipped into the liquid, these germs burst into the liquid and the substances within these germs are antidotes for the pathogens carried by the fly.\"Most doctors, if not Muslim, ridicule the idea of deliberately dipping a fly into your drink.Muhammad Had Sins\"Abu Huraira narrated: ... What do you say between the Takbir and the recitation? The Prophet said, ... O Lord! Keep me away from my sins as the East and West are apart from each other and clean me from sins as a white garment is cleaned from dirt (after thorough washing). O Lord! Wash away my sins with water, snow, and hail.\" Bukhari, Volume 1, Book 12 (Characteristics of Prayer), Chapter 8, No. 711, p.398.

One day he invoked (Allah) for a long period and then said, 'I feel that Allah has inspired me as how to cure myself.'...\" Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 54 (Beginning of Creation), Chapter 10, No. 490, p.317.

Also see Sahih Muslim, Volume 2, Book 4 (Prayer), Chapter 309, No. 1888, p.411.\"‘Aisha narrated: The Prophet continued for such and such a period imagining that he had had sexual relations with his wives which in fact he had not. One day he said to me, 'O ‘Aisha! Allah has instructed me regarding the matter about which I asked Him. Two persons came to me (in a dream), one of them sat near my head and the other near my feet. The one near my head asked the other, pointing to me, 'What is wrong with this man?' The latter replied, 'He is under the effect of magic.' The first one asked, 'Who had worked magic on him?' The other replied, 'Lubaid bin A'sam.' The first one asked, '(Under what material) has it been done?' The other replied, 'Under a skin of the pollen of a male date palm tree kept under a stone in the well of Dharwan.' Then the Prophet went to that well and said, 'This is the same well which was shown to me (in the dream). Its water looked like the infusion of henna leaves and its date-palm trees looked like the heads of devils.' ... ‘Aisha added, '(The magician) Lubaid bin A'sam was one of Bani Zuraiq, an ally of the Jews.'\" Bukhari, Volume 8, Book 73 (Good Manners), Chapter 56, No. 89, p.57. See also Bukhari, Volume 8, Book 75 (Invocations), Chapter 59, No. 400, p.266.The Daughters of AllahIn pre-Muhammad Arabia, Muhammad's tribe, the Quraysh, believed in a god named Allah (or Al'Ilah) who had three daughters called Al-Lat, Al-Uzza, and Manat.\"'Urwa said, ... regarding Ansar who used to consider Ihram while worshipping an idol called 'Manat' whom they used to worship at a place called Al-Mushallal...\" Bukhari, Volume 2, Book 26 (Pilgrimage), Chapter 78, No. 706, p.413.\"This verse was revealed concerning Ansar who used to consider Ihram for the idol Manat which was placed at a place called Qudaid...\" Bukhari, Volume 3, Book 27 (Umra), Chapter 10, No. 18, p.11. Al-Lat, Al-Uzza are described in Bukhari, Volume 8, Book 74 (Asking Permission), Chapter 52, No. 314, p.209; Volume 5, No. 375, p.259.Verses Removed from the Quran\"After that, Allah revealed a verse which was among those that were abrogated later.\" Bukhari, Volume 5, Book 59 (Military Expeditions), Chapter 27, No. 416, p.288.\"Anas bin Malik narrated: ... Allah revealed verses for those who were killed at Bir-Ma'una, and we used to recite those verses, but they were later cancelled. The verses were: 'Inform our people that we have met our Lord. He is pleased with us, and we are pleased with Him.'\" Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 52 (Jihad), Chapter 19, No. 69, p.53. See also the History of al-Tabari, Volume 7, p.156.Other mentions of abrogated verses are Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 52 (Jihad), Chapter 8, No. 57, p.45, Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 52 (Jihad), Chapter 184, No. 299, p.191, and Bukhari, Volume 5, Book 59 (Military Expeditions), Chapter 27, No. 421, p.293, all recounting the same verse.At one time, Muhammad agreed to say regarding the daughters of Allah in Surah 53:19, \"their intercession is to be hoped for.\" Muhammad said we should rely on the help of these three idols.Muhammad's followers were surprised that he said this. Later, Muhammad changed his position, saying that Satan had deceived him. These verses were abrogated or removed. Islamic scholars call these verses \"the Satanic Verses.\" It is intriguing to read Islamic explanations of how a true prophet could say such things.Unlike JesusOne thing that Christians and many Muslims agree on is that Jesus was sinless. By comparison, read about the life of Jesus in the Gospels.Muhammad and Selling Slaves\"Anas bin Malik narrated: The Prophet of Allah was on a journey, and he had a black slave named Anjasha, and he was driving the camels...\" Bukhari, Volume 8, Book 73 (Good Manners), Chapter 95, No. 182, p.117.\"Anas narrated: ... And Anjashah, the slave of the Prophet [Muhammad], was driving the camels...\" Bukhari, Volume 8, Book 73 (Good Manners), Chapter 111, No. 221, p.142.\"Jabir bin 'Abdullah narrated: A man among us declared that his slave would be freed after his death. The Prophet called that slave and sold him (1). That slave died that year.\" Footnote (1) says, \"The master was in need of money, so the Prophet sold the slave on his behalf and allowed him to revoke his promise of freeing the slave after his death.\" Bukhari, Volume 3, Book 45 (Mortgaging in Places Occupied by Settled Population), Chapter 9, No. 711, p.427.\"Then a man named Rifa'a bin Zaid ... brought a slave named Mid'am to the Prophet of Allah\" Bukhari, Volume 8, Book 78 (Oaths and Vows), Chapter 33, No. 698, p.455.\"Selling of Mudabbar (i.e., a slave who was promised to be freed after the death of his master).\" (433) Jabir narrated: \"The Prophet sold a Mudabbar (on behalf of his master who was still alive and in need of money).\" Bukhari, Volume 3, Book 34 (Sales and Trade), Chapter 112, Volume 433, before p.238.\"A man from the Ansar declared his slave Mudabbar, and he had no other property except him. When the Prophet heard of that, he said (to his companions), 'Who will buy (i.e., the slave) for me?' Nu'aim bin An-Nahham bought him for eight hundred Dirham.\" Bukhari, Volume 8, Book 79 (Expiation for Unfulfilled Oaths), Chapter 7, No. 707, p.464.\"'Ammar narrated: 'I saw the Prophet of Allah and there was no one with him except five slaves, two women, and Abu Bakr (i.e., these were the only people who had embraced Islam at that time).\" Bukhari, Volume 5, Book 57 (Companions of the Prophet), Chapter 6, No. 12, p.8.\"[Ibn Az-Zubair] sent ['Aisha] ten slaves whom he freed as expiation for his oath. 'Aisha freed more slaves for the same purpose until she freed forty slaves. She said, 'Had I known I would specify what I would do if I failed to fulfill my vow when making it, so that I could fulfill it easily.'\" (1)Footnote (1) says, \"'Aisha did not specify what she would do if she failed to fulfill her vow; hence, she freed many slaves to ensure the adequacy of her expiation.\" Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 56 (Virtues and Merits of the Prophet and His Companions), Chapter 2, No. 708, p.465.\"And 'Ata did not like to look at the slave girls who were being sold in Makkah except when he wanted to buy.\" Bukhari, Volume 8, Book 74 (Asking Permission), Chapter 2, No. 246, p.162.Sexual Relations with Slaves and Captives\"Can a person travel with a pregnant slave girl without knowing whether she is pregnant or not? Al-Hasan saw no harm in a man kissing or caressing a pregnant slave girl without having intercourse with her.Ibn 'Umar said, 'If a slave girl fit for sexual relations was given as a gift to somebody, or was sold, or was set free, her master should not have sexual relations with her before she gets one menstrual period so as to be sure of the absence of pregnancy, and there is no such necessity for a virgin.''Atâ said, 'There is no harm in caressing a pregnant (1) slave girl without having sexual relations with her. Allah said: 'Except with those joined to them in the marriage bond, or (the captives) whom their right hands possess,- for (in their case) they are free from blame.\" Footnote (1) says, \"Pregnant by another, not her present master.\" Bukhari, Volume 3, Book 34 (Sales and Trade), Chapter 113 after No. 436, p.239-240. (Same section as 'Atâ as previously.)\"Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri narrated that while he was sitting with the Prophet of Allah, he said, 'O Allah's Messenger! We get female captives as our share of the war booty, and we are interested in their prices; what is your opinion about coitus interruptus?' The Prophet said, 'Do you really do that? It is better for you not to do it, for Allah has written whom He is going to create till the Day of Resurrection.'\" Bukhari, Volume 3, Book 34 (Sales and Trade), Chapter 111, No. 432, p.237.\"Ibn Muhairiz narrated: 'I entered the mosque and saw Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri and sat beside him and asked him about Al-'Azl (i.e., coitus interruptus). Abu Sa'id said, 'We went out with Allah's Messenger for the Ghazwa [battle] of Banu Al-Mustaliq and we received captives from among the captives of the Arabs and we desired the women and the celibacy became hard on us, and we loved to do coitus interruptus. So when we intended to do coitus interruptus, we said, 'How can we do coitus interruptus before asking Allah's Messenger who is present among us?' We asked him about it and he said, 'It is better for you not to do it, for Allah has destined whom He is going to create till the Day of Resurrection.'\" Bukhari, Volume 5, Book 59 (Military Expeditions), Chapter 31, No. 459, p.317. This part says the same as Bukhari, Volume 8, Book 77 (The Book of al-Qadr), Chapter 3, No. 600, p.391. In other words, whatever is to be will be, so do not prevent it unnaturally. Muhammad never condemned the harassment of captives or slaves that one owns.‘Aisha and Zainab bint Jahsh\"Hisham's father narrated: Khadija died three years before the Prophet departed to Madina. He stayed there for about two years and then he married ‘Aisha when she was a girl of six years of age, and he consummated that marriage when she was nine years old.\" Bukhari, Volume 5, Book 58 (Virtues of the Ansar), Chapter 43, No. 236, p.153. See Volume 5, Book 58 (Virtues of the Ansar), Chapter 43, No. 234, p.152.Zainab bint Jahsh was married to Muhammad's adopted son until Muhammad declared a Surah that he should divorce his son and marry Muhammad. Zainab \"used to boast to the other wives of the Prophet and used to say that Allah married her (to the Prophet) in the heavens.\" Bukhari, Volume 9, Book 93 (Oneness, Uniqueness of Allah), Chapter 22, No. 517, p.382; also see Book 93 (Oneness, Uniqueness of Allah), Chapter 22, No. 516, 518, p.381-383. In other words, the heavenly, uncreated, and eternal Quran mentioned Zainab's marriage.Islam and Women\"'How does any one of you beat his wife as he beats the stallion camel and then embrace (sleep) with her?' And Hisham said, 'As he beats his slave.'\" Bukhari, Volume 8, Book 73 (Good Manners), Chapter 43, No. 68, p.42.\"Abu Huraira narrated: 'The Prophet of Allah said, 'Treat women nicely, for a woman is created from a rib, and the most crooked portion of the rib is its upper part; so, if you try to straighten it, it will break, but if you leave it as it is, it will remain crooked. So treat women nicely.'\" Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 55 (Prophets), Chapter 1, No. 548, p.346.\"'Abdullah bin Qais Al-Ash'ari narrated: 'The Prophet said, 'In Paradise there is a pavilion made of a single hollow pearl thirty miles in height, in each corner of the pavilion, there are wives for the believer that cannot be seen by the others.'\" Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 54 (Beginning of Creation), Chapter 7, No. 466, p.306.Women in Islamic Law\"Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri narrated: 'The Prophet said, 'Is not the witness of a woman equal to half of that of a man?' The women said, 'Yes.' He said, 'This is because of the deficiency of a woman's mind.'\" Bukhari, Volume 3, Book 48 (Witnesses), Chapter 12, No. 826, p.502.\"Muhammad said, 'A nation which makes a woman their ruler will never be successful.'\" Bukhari, Volume 9, Book 88 (Afflictions and the End of the World), Chapter 18, No. 219, p.171.Temporary Marriage (Mut’a)\"'Ali bin Abi Talib narrated: 'On the day of Khaibar, Allah's Messenger forbade the Mut’a (i.e., temporary marriage) and the eating of donkey flesh.'\" Bukhari, Volume 5, Book 59 (Military Expeditions), Chapter 37, No. 527, p.372. Bukhari, Volume 7, Book 62 (Wedlock), Chapter 32, No. 50, 52, p.36, 37 also discuss this matter. Most Muslims except some Sunnis do not practice temporary marriage, while many Shias teach that it is permissible.Race Relations and Muhammad's Ownership of African Slaves\"Anas narrated: 'The Prophet said, 'Listen and obey (your chief) even if an Ethiopian whose head is like a raisin is made your chief.'\" Bukhari, Volume 1, Book 11 (Call to Prayers), Chapter 54, No. 662, p.375 (also Ibn Majah, Volume 4, Book 24 (Jihad), Chapter 39, No. 2860, p.196). Bukhari, Volume 1, Book 11 (Call to Prayers), Chapter 55, No. 664, p.376, says similarly.As stated earlier, Muhammad was a slave owner who had at least one African slave. (Bukhari, Volume 6, Book 60, Chapter 316, No. 435, p.407, Volume 9, Book 91 (Witnesses), Chapter 3, No. 368, p.275). Muhammad sold his African slaves to free another slave who converted to Islam. Ibn Majah, Volume 4, Book 24 (Jihad), Chapter 41, No. 2869, p.202. Following are excerpts.\"Then I dressed and went to the house of the Prophet of Allah, and behold, he was staying in an upper room where his African slave was (staying) on the first step.\" (Bukhari, Volume 6, Book 60, Chapter 316, No. 435, p.407)\"Umar narrated, 'I came and saw the Messenger of Allah living in the Mashroba (an attic room) and the African slave of the Messenger of Allah was on its steps.'\" (Bukhari, Volume 9, Book 91, Chapter 3, No. 368, p.275)This is interesting because Muhammad bought a slave who had converted to Islam (perhaps to free him.) Instead of paying the owner cash, Muhammad sold two of his African slaves. The ethnicity of the first slave is not mentioned, but for some reason, it was important to note that the two slaves Muhammad sold were African, and they had to be two to buy one.\"Jabir (Allah be pleased with him) reported that there came a slave and pledged allegiance to Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) for migration. He (the Prophet) did not know that he was a slave. Then there came his master and demanded him back, whereupon Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: 'Sell him to me.' And he bought him for two black slaves, and he did not afterward take the oath of allegiance from anyone until he had asked whether he was a slave (or a free man).\" (Ibn Majah, Volume 4, Book 24 (Jihad), Chapter 41, No. 2869, p.202)The Hadith of Bukhari can be found online at the websites:http://cwis.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/andwww.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/Comments for ChristiansAlthough you may feel very blessed that you do not need to believe and do these things, do not boast. If it were not for the grace of God, you could be ensnared in such a bondage that would make you think you need to do these things to please God. Your Sunni Muslim friends may not know much about their own books and may not understand these things. Show them and ask if they really want to participate in these things.God wants us to love Him; He wants our hearts and minds as well as our conduct and actions. He does not want us to believe in unsanitary remedies like using flies, or immoral acts with captives and slave girls. God wants us to follow what He has taught us in His Word, the Bible, and through Jesus, who was more than a prophet; Isaiah called Him Emmanuel (God with us).ShalomDr. Max Shimba for Max Shimba Ministries Org",

    "full_content": "Dear Reader,Since the establishment of Islam, Muslims worldwide have believed and taught that the angel called 'Gabriel' as mentioned in the Holy Bible is the same as the angel 'Jibril' as narrated in the Quran.An important question is whether the angel \"Gabriel\" is really \"Jibril\". I urge you to follow this lesson to find out the truth...REASONS MUSLIMS BELIEVE THAT ANGEL GABRIEL IS JIBRILMuslims compare verses from the Quran and the Bible and say that Angel Gabriel is Jibril. They read these verses:QURAN 19:16-17 SURAT MARYAM16. And mention Mary in the Book when she withdrew from her family to a place toward the east.17. And she took, in seclusion from them, a screen. Then We sent to her Our Spirit, and he represented himself to her as a well-proportioned man.LUKE 1:26-2826. In the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a city in Galilee named Nazareth,27. to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. The virgin's name was Mary.28. And he came to her and said, \"Greetings, O favored one, the Lord is with you!\"In addition to reading these verses, they also refer to the book on the life of Prophet Muhammad written by the former Chief Kadhi of Kenya, the late Sheikh Abdallah Saleh Al-Farsy, in which it states on page 17 section (A):HOW THE REVELATION WAS DELIVEREDMuslims believe that the Quran is the word of Allah, as well as the Torah of Prophet Musa, the Gospel of Prophet Isa, and the Psalms of Prophet Dawud. All are considered books containing the word of Allah. But Allah is unseen and not in any specific place. So how did these prophets receive these words? The answer is that they received them through the angel Jibril, the greatest of all Allah's angels.QURAN 53:2-6 SURATUL NAJM (THE STAR)2. Your companion [Muhammad] has not strayed, nor has he erred,3. Nor does he speak from [his own] inclination.4. It is not but a revelation revealed,5. Taught to him by one intense in strength -6. One of soundness. And he rose to [his] true form.By reading these verses, Muslims believe that Angel Gabriel is Jibril. However, these verses show a difference since the angel Jibril was sent by Allah, who is not Jehovah, to Mary, who was in the mosque, and the Quran does not mention the city or country where Jibril went. But we see the Bible teaching that the angel Gabriel entered Mary's house, and again, the Bible teaches that the revelation of prophecy was brought under the guidance of the Holy Spirit (2 Peter 1:20-21) and not by the angel Jibril as the Quran narrates.WHAT KIND OF BEINGS ARE ANGELS?HEBREWS 1:13-1413. To which of the angels did God ever say, \"Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet\"?14. Are not all angels ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation?It is clear that angels are spirit beings who can appear to people in human form, as seen in Genesis 18:1-19:12 when they visited Abraham and Lot. An angel appeared to Moses in the form of a burning bush that was not consumed (Exodus 3:1-5).ARE ALL ANGELS GOOD AND DO THEY NOT DISOBEY GOD?When we read the Quran, we see that Allah, who is worshipped by Muslims, describes angels as beings with the following attributes:QURAN 16:93 SURATUL AN-NAHL (THE BEE)Had Allah willed, He could have made you [all] one community [united in religion], but He sends astray whom He wills and guides whom He wills, and you will surely be questioned about what you used to do.QURAN 32:13 SURAT AS-SAJDAH (THE PROSTRATION)And if We had willed, We could have given every soul its guidance, but the word from Me will come into effect [that] \"I will surely fill Hell with jinn and men all together.\"EXPLANATION OF QURAN 32:13If Allah had willed, He could have created humans like angels who cannot do evil; their nature is only to do good. Therefore, they are not rewarded for their good deeds because they do not struggle to do them. But humans are created with the ability to do both good and evil equally, and they find pleasure more in doing evil.According to these verses, Allah, worshipped by Muslims, says that angels are good and cannot do evil and are one group that always obeys Allah. But when we refer to the Bible, we see our God Jehovah revealing to His prophets that angels are like this:2 PETER 2:4For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but sent them to hell, putting them in chains of darkness to be held for judgment.These fallen angels are under the devil, but apart from these fallen ones, there are also angels of this kind:MATTHEW 25:31When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his glorious throne.According to these verses, it is clear that our God teaches about two groups of angels, the good (holy) and the bad (fallen). This teaching, which Allah does not provide, since he says angels are only good, shows that Allah is not Jehovah.MEANING OF THE NAME GABRIELThe name \"Gabriel\" originates from the Hebrew language and means \"Messenger of God.\" In the Bible, the name Gabriel is mentioned four times (see Daniel 8:16, 9:21, Luke 1:19, and 1:26). Regarding Angel Gabriel, the Bible often shows that God sends him to bring good news concerning human salvation and to offer words of comfort to those he appears to by saying \"do not be afraid.\" In the Bible, the term \"Angel of the Lord\" is mentioned 65 times across 61 verses. If all these instances refer to Gabriel, then he is mentioned many times.HOW TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN GABRIEL AND JIBRIL1 TIMOTHY 4:1The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons.(See also Matthew 7:15-20)1 JOHN 4:1, 3, 15Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.But every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world.If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them and they in God.The important thing is to test whether Jibril or Gabriel acknowledges Jesus as the Son of God. If their teachings are the same, then they may not be two different angels but one. If they differ, they are two completely different angels.IS THE RANK OF ANGEL GABRIEL THE SAME AS JIBRIL?GABRIEL, THE ANGEL SENT BY JEHOVAH GOD, SAYS THIS:Luke 1:19 - The angel answered him, \"I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news.\"According to this verse, Angel Gabriel explains that he stands in the presence of God, thus his rank is a messenger who stands before God. Is the rank of Jibril, sent by Allah, the same as Gabriel's?QURAN 81:19-21 SURATUL AT-TAKWIR (THE FOLDING UP)19. Indeed, the Quran is a word conveyed by a noble messenger (Jibril)20. Who is possessed of power and with the Owner of the Throne, secure [in position],21. Obeyed there [in the heavens] and trustworthy.EXPLANATION OF QURAN 81:19-21The noble and obedient messenger in the heavens is \"Jibril,\" who is the \"Chief of all Angels.\"WHO IS THE CHIEF ANGEL OF JEHOVAH?JUDE 1:9But Michael the archangel, when he disputed with the devil and argued about the body of Moses, did not dare pronounce against him a railing judgment, but said, \"The Lord rebuke you!\"According to this verse, it is clear that the chief angel of Jehovah, whom we Christians worship, is Michael, while the chief angel of Allah, worshipped by Muslims, is Jibril. Therefore, Jibril is not Gabriel. Returning to the chief angel \"Michael,\" this name has Hebrew origins and means \"Who is like God.\" This is because he led the other angels in defeating Satan and expelling him from heaven when he exalted himself and wanted to be like God (See Revelation 12:7-12 and Daniel 10:13, 21; 12:2).THEIR TEACHINGS ABOUT THE SONSHIP OF GOD(A) GABRIEL, THE ANGEL OF JEHOVAH, TAUGHT THIS:LUKE 1:26-35(Quoting only verse 35)The angel answered her, \"The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore, the child to be born will be called holy—the Son of God.\"(B) JIBRIL, THE ANGEL OF ALLAH, SAYS THIS:QURAN 18:4-5 SURATUL AL-KAHF (THE CAVE)4. And to warn those who say, \"Allah has taken a son.\"5. They have no knowledge of it, nor do their forefathers. Grave is the word that comes out of their mouths; they speak not except a lie.These words taught by Jibril (QURAN 53:5-6) blaspheme our God Jehovah (See Exodus 4:22) where God says, \"Israel is My son, My firstborn,\" and His angel Gabriel taught the sonship of God.THEIR TEACHINGS ABOUT THE HOLY SPIRITLUKE 1:34-35(Gabriel says to Mary)34. Mary said to the angel, \"How will this be, since I am a virgin?\"35. The angel answered, \"The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore, the child to be born will be called holy—the Son of God.\"The Holy Spirit is God (Acts 5:3-4) and not an angel, hence the angel said He will come upon you.QURAN 16:102 SURATUL AN-NAHL (THE BEE)Say, \"The Holy Spirit has brought it down from your Lord in truth to make firm those who believe...\"QURAN 2:87 SURATUL AL-BAQARAH (THE COW)And We did certainly give Moses the Scripture and followed up after him with messengers. And We gave Jesus, the Son of Mary, clear proofs, and We supported him with the Holy Spirit.EXPLANATION OF QURAN 2:87For Muslims, the Holy Spirit is \"Angel Jibril\" and not the one Christians claim to be part of the Trinity. Here we see that Gabriel does not say he is the Holy Spirit anywhere, but Jibril claims he is the Holy Spirit—thus, Gabriel is not Jibril.DID ANGEL JIBRIL DELIVER PROPHECY TO THE JEWS?QURAN 2:97 SURATUL AL-BAQARAH (THE COW)Say, \"Whoever is an enemy to Jibril—it is [none but] he who has brought the Quran down upon your heart, [O Muhammad], by permission of Allah...\"EXPLANATION OF QURAN 2:97The Jews, in their schemes to reject Prophet Muhammad, asked him, \"Which angel brings you revelation?\" The Prophet said, \"Jibril.\" They said, \"Oh! HE IS OUR ENEMY, WE DO NOT WANT HIM. If another angel brought you revelation (i.e., inspiration), we would follow you.\" Jibril did not bring prophecy to the Jews; moreover, this angel Jibril teaches about the Jews like this:QURAN 5:82 SURATUL AL-MAIDAH (THE TABLE SPREAD)You will surely find the most intense of the people in animosity toward the believers [to be] the Jews and those who associate others with Allah.Here we see Jibril teaching Muslims that their greatest enemies are the Jews. Being an enemy of the Jews is being an enemy of salvation since Lord Jesus teaches us this...JOHN 4:19-22(Quoting only verse 22)You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews.Furthermore, all prophets are Jews, from Moses, David, Isaiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, Micah, Malachi, John the Baptist, and even Jesus.IS THE WAY ANGEL GABRIEL APPEARS TO PEOPLE THE SAME AS JIBRIL?(A) JIBRILQURAN 19:16-2616. And mention Mary in the Book when she withdrew from her family to a place toward the east.17. And she took, in seclusion from them, a screen. Then We sent to her Our Spirit, and he represented himself to her as a well-proportioned man.18. She said, \"Indeed, I seek refuge in the Most Merciful from you, [so leave me], if you should be fearing of Allah.\"19. He said, \"I am only the messenger of your Lord to give you [news of] a pure boy.\"20. She said, \"How can I have a boy while no man has touched me and I have not been unchaste?\"21. He said, \"Thus [it will be]; your Lord says, 'It is easy for Me, and We will make him a sign to the people and a mercy from Us. And it is a matter [already] decreed.'\"22. So she conceived him, and she withdrew with him to a remote place.23. And the pains of childbirth drove her to the trunk of a palm tree. She said, \"Oh, I wish I had died before this and was in oblivion, forgotten.\"24. But he called her from below her, \"Do not grieve; your Lord has provided beneath you a stream.25. And shake toward you the trunk of the palm tree; it will drop upon you ripe, fresh dates.26. So eat and drink and be contented...HOW JIBRIL ACTED WHEN HE APPEARED TO MUHAMMAD:One day—in the month of Ramadan, on the 17th, on a Monday in the 40th year and a half of his life—the Prophet saw a man standing before him without seeing where he came from. The man said to him, \"Read.\" The Prophet replied, \"I cannot read, for I have not learned to read.\" The man came closer, grabbed him, and said again, \"Read.\" The Prophet replied with the same answer. The third time the man said, \"Read—in the name of your Lord.\" He recited the beginning of Surah 96 until the middle. The Prophet then repeated it as it was recited to him. This was the first Surah revealed in the Quran, although it is not placed at the beginning. Suddenly, the man (angel) disappeared from his sight. The Prophet returned home, trembling with fear. When he reached home, Lady Khadija thought he had a fever, covered him with blankets, and sat by him, listening to his feverish murmuring. When the fever subsided, he narrated to Lady Khadija what had happened, and she comforted him and assured him that nothing bad would happen to him. Lady Khadija then went to her relative, Mr. Waraka bin Naufal, and told him everything that had happened to her husband. Mr. Waraka asked to see Muhammad, and the Prophet went and narrated his experience. Mr. Waraka said to him, \"That was Jibril who appeared to Prophet Musa and Prophet Isa. So be glad that you are the Prophet of this nation. I wish I could live to see you stand up to reform your people. InshaAllah, I will be your right-hand man.\" They returned home, and the fear left him.This account is found in the book \"The Life of Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W.)\" written by Sheikh Abdulla Saleh Farsy, who was the Chief Kadhi of Zanzibar and later the Chief Kadhi of Kenya, on pages 16-17.(B) HOW ANGEL GABRIEL APPEARED TO PEOPLE:LUKE 1:19Gabriel introduced himself by saying, \"I am Gabriel.\"DANIEL 8:15-16Or the person to whom he appeared was informed first.DANIEL 8:17-21LUKE 1:13, 30Gabriel reassures the person when they are afraid and says, \"Do not be afraid.\" Gabriel's nature is compassionate and gentle in informing the person, while Jibril of Allah grabs and squeezes people, causing Muhammad to experience fever. The question is, who is this Jibril?WHAT KIND OF BEINGS DOES ALLAH SEND?QURAN 19:83 SURATUL MARYAMDo you not see that We have sent the devils upon the disbelievers, inciting them to [evil] with [constant] incitement?QURAN 6:112 SURATUL AL-AN’AMAnd thus We have made for every prophet an enemy—devils from mankind and jinn, inspiring to one another decorated speech in delusion...Satan has the ability to transform into this form:2 CORINTHIANS 11:10-15(Quoting only verse 14)And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light.**Everyone who acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God remains in them and they in God (1 John 4:1-3, 15). Angel Gabriel acknowledged that Jesus is the Son of God, but Jibril did not acknowledge this (Luke 1:35; Quran 9:30). So, who is Jibril?WHAT IS THE FATE OF THE BEINGS ALLAH SENDS?Allah sends devils. The Holy Scriptures of the Bible teach us the fate of these beings as follows:MATTHEW 25:41(Jesus will command them)Then he will say to those on his left, \"Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.\"Dear beloved, I hope in our Lord Jesus Christ that you have come to clearly understand that Angel Gabriel of our God Jehovah is not the same as Jibril of Allah worshipped by Muslims.May the Lord bless you greatly as you spread this message to the nations so they may turn to the Lord Jesus and be saved.Amen!Today we have learned that Jibril in the Quran is not Gabriel in the Bible.Narrated by Max Shimba Ministries OrgDr. Max Shimba",

Follow along...KNOW THE FALSE PROPHETSBy Teacher Daniel MwankemwaINTRODUCTION:The issue of identifying false prophets has been a significant challenge for many people because these false prophets come claiming, \"We have been sent by Allah to deliver His message, and thus people must accept, believe, and follow it.\" When a prophet comes in this manner and meets people who cannot discern prophets and messengers based on God's Word, that is when deception occurs, and various groups of false beliefs emerge.Here in Tanzania, when you read the Constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania, Article 19 (i-iii), you will find explanations that a follower of any religion has the freedom to change their initial religion and join another religion they deem suitable for them. However, despite that freedom, not every religion (path) is suitable; some lead to eternal death.Proverbs 14:12 \"There is a way that appears to be right, but in the end it leads to death.\" (See also Proverbs 16:25).Among the individuals called prophets and messengers is a man named Muhammad s.a.w ibn Abdullah, ibn Abdu Muttalib, who is a prophet and messenger in the Islamic religion.You, the reader of this lesson, might wonder how we, who are not Muslims but Christians, begin to question the matters of Muhammad s.a.w, the prophet of Muslims. The answer is that the Quran, used by Muslims, mentions us Christians 62 times, urging us to accept, believe, and eventually follow Muhammad's message, claiming that he is the final prophet and messenger even to us Christians, sent by God.We read this in the Quran in Surah Al-Baqarah (The Cow), 2:62:\"Indeed, those who believed and those who were Jews or Christians or Sabeans - those [among them] who believed in Allah (as Muhammad says now) and the Last Day and did righteousness - will have their reward with their Lord, and no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve.\"For us as Christians, although we are mentioned in this verse, a question arises about Muhammad's prophethood and messengership: \"WHAT DID ALLAH FORGET IN HIS COMPLETE WORK OF REDEEMING HUMANITY FROM SIN THAT HE HAD TO SEND MUHAMMAD S.A.W?\"What is a prophet?A prophet is a person officially chosen by divine criteria to deliver God's message to people. In other words, a prophet is a spokesperson for God's mysteries.A prophet is a person who is a mouthpiece of God. He stands between God and humans, with the duty of delivering God's message to people. When a prophet is a spokesperson for God, he is inspired by the Holy Spirit, and his message is without error. The prophet restrains his own will, self, and thoughts when delivering God's prophetic message. Sometimes God Himself puts His words in their mouths (Deut 18:18, Jer 1:9). A prophet is a servant of God (Zech 1:6) and a messenger of God (2 Chron 36:15). Their prophecies are divided into three categories: prophecies concerning the fate of Israel, prophecies related to the coming of the Messiah, and eschatological prophecies (prophecies about future events). Therefore, the Law and the Prophets relate to the Pentateuch, i.e., Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. The prophets are all other books besides the Pentateuch.The book of the prophet Amos 3:7 \"Surely the Sovereign LORD does nothing without revealing his plan to his servants the prophets.\" The word prophet originates from the Hebrew language and means seer. 1 Sam 9:9 \"Formerly in Israel, if someone went to inquire of God, they would say, 'Come, let us go to the seer,' because the prophet of today used to be called a seer.\"This verse shows that true prophets of God must have their revelation or message originating from Allah Himself (the Holy Spirit), or dreams from Him, or visions from Him (Num 12:6), or through holy angels (Dan 8:15-21). Otherwise, they are false prophets.Warning from Lord Jesus:When Lord Jesus was here on earth, He warned us about recognizing false prophets and messengers before Muhammad was born (he was born in 570 AD), before Islam was established by Muhammad in 610 AD, and before the existence of a book called the Quran. We read these warnings from Lord Jesus in:Matthew 7:15-16 \"Watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves. By their fruit, you will recognize them.\"Matthew 24:11-13 \"And many false prophets will appear and deceive many people. Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold, but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved.\"The apostles of Lord Jesus emphasized and reinforced Jesus' warning about recognizing false prophets and apostles.1 John 4:1-3, 15 \"Dear friends, do not believe every spirit but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. This is how you can recognize the Spirit of God: Every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world. 15 If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them and they in God.\"These criteria given by the Holy Bible to identify false prophets and messengers are very important for us to examine in the lives of those who call themselves prophets or messengers.A true prophet receives revelation through the Holy Spirit:2 Peter 1:20-21 \"Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet’s own interpretation of things. For prophecy never had its origin in the human will, but prophets, though human, spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.\"1 Peter 1:10-11 \"Concerning this salvation, the prophets, who spoke of the grace that was to come to you, searched intently and with the greatest care, trying to find out the time and circumstances to which the Spirit of Christ in them was pointing when he predicted the sufferings of the Messiah and the glories that would follow.\"Revelation 19:10 \"At this, I fell at his feet to worship him. But he said to me, 'Don’t do that! I am a fellow servant with you and with your brothers and sisters who hold to the testimony of Jesus. Worship God! For it is the Spirit of prophecy who bears testimony to Jesus.'\"Thus, the prophets spoke within them being led by the Spirit of Christ Himself, even before He came to the world in the flesh. Is Muhammad s.a.w among them for us to believe his message?Muhammad did not know how to read or writeQuran 7:157\"Those who follow the Messenger, the unlettered prophet (who can neither read nor write) whom they find written in what they have of the Torah and the Gospel...\"Another evidence can be found in the book \"Life of Prophet Muhammad\" page 8 written by Sheikh Abdallah Saleh Al-Farsy. We read as follows in the learning segment:“There was no reading or writing in the Hijaz region, so the Prophet grew up like other Quraysh without knowing how to read or write. Their education was to learn matters concerning their Bedouin life, such as wars, composing poems to boast their bravery, and giving speeches that could stir people to fight without thinking.”Thus, Muhammad in his life did not know how to read or write, and that is how he lived his entire life.Did Jesus know how to read and write?Luke 4:16-17. Muslims claim in John 7:14 that people in Jerusalem were surprised by Jesus's knowledge, wondering how He learned without studying. The truth is that Jerusalem was not where Jesus grew up. He grew up in Nazareth, where people knew He could read, which is why He was given the scroll of the prophet Isaiah to read.How Muhammad (S.A.W) Received His Prophethood and RevelationThe revelation Muhammad received as the prophet of Muslims is very different from all the prophets before him mentioned in the Holy Bible. The difference is that all the prophets and apostles mentioned in the Holy Bible, written by various authors numbering about 40 over a long period, nearly 1500 years, have a unified revelation (it has conformity). The prophecies of the Old Testament are fulfilled in the New Testament. This is because the source of the revelation is one, the Holy Spirit.But for Muhammad s.a.w, the source of his revelation and eventually his prophethood is very controversial, and even followers of that religion do not know the exact truth.Let's briefly examine this controversy.When Muhammad s.a.w reached the age of 38, he moved from his home to caves near the city of Mecca. When he reached 40, one day, he encountered a being that Muslims today call the Angel Jibril.The revelation Muhammad received came with the sound of bells, a red face, and sweating. In Bukhari, Hadith 2, Volume 1, Al-Lu’lu Book 3, Page 874 Hadith 1505:“Hadith of Aisha r.a mother of the believers, said that Al Harith ibn Hisham r.a asked the Prophet of Allah s.a.w, 'O Messenger of Allah, how does the revelation come to you?' The Prophet of Allah s.a.w replied, 'Sometimes it comes like the ringing of a bell, and this is the hardest on me. When it leaves, I have understood what it said. Other times, the angel comes to me in the form of a man, and he speaks to me, and I grasp what he says.' Aisha r.a said, 'And indeed, I saw it coming upon him on a very cold day, and when it left, his forehead was dripping with sweat.'”Quran 53:2-6 Suratul Najm (The Star) \"Your companion [Muhammad] has not strayed, nor has he erred, nor does he speak from [his own] inclination. It is not but a revelation revealed, taught to him by one intense in strength - one of soundness.\"Muslims claim that this Angel Jibril is the same as the Holy Spirit who revealed the Quran to Muhammad. When we read the explanation of Surah 2:87 in the Quran, it says:\"For Muslims, the Holy Spirit is Angel Jibril, not the one Christians claim as part of the Trinity.\"One thing I want you to know is that all Muslims were not given knowledge about the Spirit. This includes their prophet Muhammad. We read this in Quran 3:7:\"He is the one who sent down to you the Book; in it, there are definite verses (clear in meaning) that are the essence of the Book, and others are allegorical. As for those in whose hearts is deviation, they follow the part of it which is allegorical, seeking discord and seeking an interpretation. And no one knows its interpretation except Allah. But those firm in knowledge say, 'We believe in it. All [of it] is from our Lord.' And no one will be reminded except those of understanding.\"Quran 17:85 Suratul Ban Israil (The Children of Israel):\"And they ask you about the soul. Say, 'The soul is of the affair of my Lord. And you have not been given of knowledge except a little.'\"Thus, in Islam, they lack the knowledge of the Spirit according to the Quran. This is why they often focus more on external matters than spiritual ones, such as washing and rinsing the nose with water, believing they have expelled Satan who was in the nose. In the book \"Al-Lu'lu' wal-Marjan,\" Volume 1, Hadith 183, Page 96, it reads:\"Narrated by Abu Huraira (r.a), the Prophet (s.a.w) said, 'When one of you wakes up from sleep, let him wash his nose by sniffing water and blowing it out three times because Satan spends the night in the upper part of his nose.' (Bukhari, Hadith No. 516, Volume 4)\"Having understood how Muslims lack the knowledge of the Spirit, we now question who this angel called Jibril is. Is he an angel of the true God YEHOVA?The Holy Bible explains about angels who rebelled in heaven and were cast down. 1 Peter 2:4 \"For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but sent them to hell, putting them in chains of darkness to be held for judgment;\"These teachings of the Bible show that there is a group of angels that rebelled and were cast out and are now awaiting judgment. This group today is called Satan, Jinn, or unclean spirits.But when we read the Quran, a book that came much later in the 7th century (610 AD), after the Bible, we get different information about angels.Quran 32:13 Suratul As-Sajdah (Prostration):\"If We had willed, We could have given every soul its guidance, but the word from Me will come into effect [that] 'I will surely fill Hell with jinn and men all together.'\"The explanation of this verse in the Quran reads:\"If Allah had willed, He would have created humans like angels who cannot do evil, their nature being to do only good; therefore, they would not be rewarded for their good deeds because they do them effortlessly. But humans are created capable of both, and their joy is more in doing evil.\"This verse and its explanation state that all angels of Muhammad's Allah are good; none has sinned, and among those angels, one appeared to Muhammad and gave him prophethood and the revelation of the Quran. Now let’s examine the cave where Muhammad was when he received his prophethood. We will be guided by Islamic religious books.In the book \"Life of Prophet Muhammad\" page 16-17 written by Sheikh Abdullah Saleh Al-Farsy, we read as follows:\"Then one day - in the month of Ramadan on the 17th, Monday in the year of his 40th ½ age - the Prophet saw a person standing before him without seeing where he came from. The person said to him, 'Read.' The Prophet replied, 'I do not know how to read for I have not learned to read.' The person came and held him, squeezed him, and said again, 'Read,' and the Prophet gave the same answer. For the third time, the person said, 'Read - Iqraa Bismi Rabbik.' He recited that part of Surah 96 to him. Then the Prophet read it as it was recited to him. This was the first Surah to be revealed in the Quran, although it was not placed at the beginning.Suddenly, that person (the Angel) disappeared from his sight - he could not see where he went. And the Prophet returned home, fear had gripped him. When he reached home, Lady Khadija thought he had a fever, covered him with clothes, and sat in front of him listening to him groan. When the fever subsided, he explained everything that had happened to Lady Khadija, and she comforted him, assuring him that nothing bad would happen to him. Immediately, she went to her relative - Mr. Waraqa bin Naufal - and gave him the full story. He instructed her to bring Muhammad to him. And the Prophet went and told him the whole story. Mr. Waraqa told him, 'That is Jibril who came to Prophet Musa and Prophet Isa. So be glad that you are the Prophet of this nation, and I wish I were alive to see you standing to reform your people; InshaAllah, I will be your right hand.' They returned home, and all the fear left him.\"He was played with by Satan in the cave:In the book titled \"Great Prophets and Their Wives\" written by Sheikh Abdullah Saleh Al-Farsy, page 12, we read:\"Then the Prophet was frightened and returned to his wife, told her the story, and immediately got a high fever, asking to be covered with clothes. Suddenly he began shaking and groaning, saying, 'I fear that Satan has played with me and driven me mad and deceived me.' Lady Khadija immediately replied, 'Stop that; it will not happen. You cannot be played with by demons. Satan cannot play with a person of your character. You take good care of your relatives, carry the burdens of even those who are not yours, and show people your good qualities that no one else has. You do this and that. Be glad, my brother. Calm your heart, by Allah! I see that you have become a prophet.\"In this incident that happened to Muhammad while in the cave, Muslims worldwide say that this is where Muhammad s.a.w received revelation and was given prophethood. But when you reflect on that message, you see that even he did not know what had happened to him in the cave. That is why we read that when he reached home, his wife, Lady Khadija, covered him with clothes thinking he had a fever. Muhammad told his wife what had happened, saying it was \"Satan,\" not mentioning any angel as Muslims want us to believe today. Because if it were an angel as we read in the Bible, he would not have hesitated to identify himself to Muhammad. This is the first point.The second pointis that we see a man named Waraqah ibn Naufal, the cousin of Muhammad's wife Lady Khadija. He tells Muhammad that the being that appeared to him was Angel Jibril. He then says, \"Be glad that you are the Prophet of this nation!\" Was he present in the cave when Muhammad was approached by an unknown being?The third pointis that even his wife, Lady Khadija, tells her husband about this prophethood. Was she in the cave? If not, who told her that it was Angel Jibril, given that Muhammad himself, who encountered the being, said he was approached by Satan? Reflect on this.In the book titled \"Tafsir Al-Kashif,\" by Muhammad Jawad Mughniyyah, page 74, paragraph 7, it reads:\"There is no way to know Iblis, Satan, and Jinn except through revelation (revelation).\"Quran Suratul Sad 38:69 Muhammad is quoted saying:\"I had no knowledge of the exalted assembly of angels...\"Because Muhammad s.a.w did not know angels, he says when you see a donkey bray, it has seen Satan. In the book \"The Truthful Trustworthy,\" Volume 3-4, Hadith 789, page 38, \"The Prophet (s.a.w) said, 'If a donkey brays, it has seen Satan.'\"This matter is different from how the Holy Bible explains about donkeys. God can even use a donkey to speak to humans to inform them of His message. In the book of Numbers 22:22-31, we read about Balaam and how God used a donkey to tell Balaam not to continue his journey after the donkey saw the angel of the Lord standing before them with a drawn sword blocking their way. The donkey spoke to Balaam in verse 30-31:\"The donkey said to Balaam, 'Am I not your own donkey, which you have always ridden, to this day? Have I been in the habit of doing this to you?' 'No,' he said. Then the LORD opened Balaam's eyes, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the road with his sword drawn. So he bowed low and fell facedown.\"It appears that in this incident with Balaam, God opened his eyes to see the angel. But for Muhammad, what he sees is Satan. That is why he says when a donkey brays, it has seen Satan.Therefore, if Muhammad's revelation begins with Satan as explained in the authentic Islamic books, according to the explanation in the book \"Tafsir Al-Kashif,\" it shows that Muhammad's revelation, prophethood, and even apostleship have a significant flaw compared to the message of the prophets and apostles mentioned in the Holy Bible.In the Bible, Satan is mentioned as being able to disguise himself as an angel of light.2 Corinthians 11:13-15 \"For such people are false apostles, deceitful workers, masquerading as apostles of Christ. And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light. It is not surprising, then, if his servants also masquerade as servants of righteousness. Their end will be what their actions deserve.\"When Muhammad was in Medina, he was asked by the Jews if his revelation came from the true God, by being asked to provide the characteristics of prophets. In response, Muhammad said:\"The Truthful Trustworthy,\" Volume 3-4, Page 63, Hadith No. 880:\"The Prophet (s.a.w) said, 'There are four qualities of the prophets: modesty, using perfume, marrying (wives), and using the tooth-stick.'\"These are not divine characteristics for a prophet and apostle but merely human ones.Prophets and various people in the Bible did not feel shame.Read Isaiah 50:7 \"Because the Sovereign LORD helps me, I will not be disgraced. Therefore, I have set my face like flint, and I know I will not be put to shame.\"Psalm 34:5 \"Those who look to him are radiant; their faces are never covered with shame.\"Psalm 119:46 \"I will speak of your statutes before kings and will not be put to shame.\"Romans 1:16 \"For I am not ashamed of the gospel because it is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes: first to the Jew, then to the Gentile.\"1 Peter 4:16 \"However, if you suffer as a Christian, do not be ashamed, but praise God that you bear that name.\"Moreover, we see that Muhammad was bewitched. Being bewitched is the state of being affected by dark powers, i.e., witchcraft. Can a prophet or messenger of the true God be bewitched?In Quran Suratul Ban-Israel, 17:47 \"We know very well why they listen when they listen to you, and when they conspire in secret, when the wrongdoers say, 'You follow none but a bewitched man.'\"Also, in Suratul Falaq, 113:1-5 \"Say, 'I seek refuge in the Lord of the dawn, from the evil of what He has created, and from the evil of darkness when it settles, and from the evil of those who blow on knots (those who practice witchcraft), and from the evil of an envier when he envies.'\"We read this incident in its explanation in the Quran, 8th edition, page 977, explaining Surahs 113-114:\"The impact of witchcraft on the Prophet (s.a.w). The second question that arises regarding these two surahs is that according to the hadith, witchcraft was performed against the Prophet (s.a.w) and he became ill, and to remove the impact of witchcraft, Jibril (a.s) came and gave him instructions to recite these two surahs. Many researchers, past and present, have opposed this matter, saying that if these hadith are accepted, then the entire system of sharia will be questionable because if the Prophet (s.a.w) could be affected by witchcraft and indeed showed its effects according to these hadith, then we cannot deny or dispute to what extent the enemies were able to make the Prophet (s.a.w) say and do things under the influence of witchcraft, and in his teachings, how much came from Allah and how much resulted from the impact of witchcraft on him. Not only that, but they also say these hadith contradict the Quran, as stated in the Quran, that the false claim of the disbelievers was that the Prophet (s.a.w) was bewitched, and he was affected by witchcraft: 'When the wrongdoers say, 'You follow none but a bewitched man.'' (17:47), but these hadith affirm the claims of the disbelievers that he was indeed affected and guided by witchcraft...According to the hadith narrated by Bukhari, Muslim, Nasai, Ibn Majah, Ahmad, 'Abdur Razzaq, Humaid, Baihaqi, Tabarani, Ibn Sa'd, Ibn Marduyah, Ibn Abi Shaibah, Hakim, Abd bin Humaid, and other Muhaddithin from Aisha (r.a), Zaid bin Arqam, Ibn 'Abbas through numerous chains of narration, it shows that the matter itself has reached the state of complete continuity, except that each hadith is a complete report.\"This is another substantial evidence showing that Muhammad's prophethood has issues. If Muslims themselves, according to these hadith, do not know how many of Muhammad's statements came from Allah and how many were influenced by sorcerers, can his revelation and prophethood be from the true God? Reflect on this!In the Holy Bible, there is no bewitchment of God's people.Numbers 23:23 \"There is no divination against Jacob, no evil omens against Israel. It will now be said of Jacob and of Israel, 'See what God has done!'\"According to the Holy Bible, true prophets and messengers of God come from the nation of Israel.The book of Ezekiel 13:9 \"My hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and utter lying divinations. They will not belong to the council of my people or be listed in the records of Israel, nor will they enter the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the Sovereign LORD.\"Also, according to the Quran, prophets and messengers must come from Jacob, who is the son of Isaac, who is the son of Abraham.Quran Suratul Al-Ankabut (The Spider), 29:27 \"And We gave [to him] Isaac and Jacob, and We placed in his descendants prophethood and [revelation of] the Book, and We gave him his reward in this world, and indeed, he is in the Hereafter among the righteous.\"This verse continues to emphasize that prophethood and the Book come through the descendants of Jacob. Unfortunately, Muhammad ibn Abdullah does not come from that lineage or even from Ishmael as Muslims claim. Because Ishmael is a Hebrew like his father, Abraham, who is also a Hebrew (Genesis 14:13), and Muhammad is an Arab from the Quraysh tribe. Recognizing this, we see Muhammad warning others to stay away from his tribe.Sahih Al-Bukhari Volume 1, Hadith No. 801, and Al-Lu'lu Book 3, Page 1089, Hadith No. 1846:\"The hadith of Abu Huraira (r.a) states, 'The Prophet of Allah (s.a.w) said, 'This Quraysh tribe will destroy people.' They asked, 'What do you advise us?' He said, 'I advise people to separate from it.'\"Dipping a fly in a drinkBukhari Volume 4 Hadith 537: \"Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet said: If a house fly falls into the drink of any one of you, he should dip it (in the drink) because one of its wings has a disease, and the other has the cure for the disease.\"The Apostles of Jesus in the Holy Bible warned us about such filth. In 2 Corinthians 7:1:\"Therefore, since we have these promises, dear friends, let us purify ourselves from everything that contaminates body and spirit, perfecting holiness out of reverence for God.\"Among the teachings of Muhammad is that there are ten things that complete Islam, and we read about them in the book \"The Truthful Trustworthy,\" written by Sheikh Said Moosa Al-Kindy of Muscat, Volume 3-4, Page 63, Hadith No. 880:\"The Prophet (s.a.w) said, 'There are ten things that complete Islam: trimming the mustache, letting the beard grow (not shaving it), using the tooth-stick, cleaning inside the nose with water, cutting the nails, washing the hands between the fingers, plucking (or shaving) the armpit hair, shaving the pubic hair, and conserving water. The tenth one, the narrator of the hadith said, I forgot, but he said it must be 'circumcision.'\"According to the Bible, prophets and messengers are confirmed through miracles.Exodus 14:21 \"Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and all that night the LORD drove the sea back with a strong east wind and turned it into dry land.\"Acts 19:11-12 \"God did extraordinary miracles through Paul so that even handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched him were taken to the sick, and their illnesses were cured, and the evil spirits left them.\" See also Acts 16:16-18, 20:7-12, and Acts 13:6-12.The Quran also confirms that prophets and messengers must perform miracles.Quran 40:78 Suratul Al-Mumin (The Believer):\"And We certainly sent messengers before you. Among them are those [whose stories] We have related to you, and among them are those [whose stories] We have not related to you. And it was not for any messenger to bring a sign except by permission of Allah.\"Muhammad was not given any miracle to confirm his claims of prophethood and messengership.Quran 29:50 Suratul Al-Ankabut (The Spider):\"And they say, 'Why are not signs sent down to him from his Lord?' Say, 'The signs are only with Allah, and I am only a clear warner.'\"In the Quran, there is a verse that we should all reflect on together. In Suratul An-Nisaa (Women), 4:79, \"Whatever of good reaches you is from Allah, but whatever of evil befalls you is from yourself. And We have sent you to the people as a messenger, and sufficient is Allah as a witness.\"This verse shows that Muhammad, the prophet of Muslims, was sent to people as a messenger, with Allah being just a witness. A witness is never the doer but merely the observer of the deed. Our question is, who are the people who sent Muhammad to the people? Because we saw earlier that after Muhammad left the cave, his wife Lady Khadija told him about the prophethood, and Mr. Waraqah ibn Naufal said to Muhammad, \"So be glad that you are the prophet of this nation\" before the Quran. Are these not the ones referred to as \"We have sent you\" mentioned in the verse above? Reflect on this!Muslims claim that Muhammad was sent by their Allah, who is the King of Kings. But when we read the Holy Bible in Revelation 17:14, \"They will wage war against the Lamb, but the Lamb will triumph over them because He is Lord of lords and King of kings—and with Him will be His called, chosen and faithful followers.\"In Revelation 19:11-16, \"I saw heaven standing open, and there before me was a white horse, whose rider is called Faithful and True. With justice, He judges and wages war. His eyes are like blazing fire, and on His head are many crowns. He has a name written on Him that no one knows but He Himself. He is dressed in a robe dipped in blood, and His name is the Word of God. The armies of heaven were following Him, riding on white horses and dressed in fine linen, white and clean. Coming out of His mouth is a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations. 'He will rule them with an iron scepter.' He treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God Almighty. On His robe and on His thigh, He has this name written: King of kings and Lord of lords.\"Jesus Christ is the King of kings and Lord of lords. But when we read the authentic Islamic hadith, they explain that the greatest enemy of Allah (s.w) the God whom Muslims worship is the one called the King of Kings.Sahih Al-Bukhari, Volume 8, Hadith No. 225, Al-Lu’lu wal-Marjan, Volume 3, Hadith No. 1385:\"The hadith of Abu Huraira (r.a) states, 'The Prophet of Allah (s.a.w) said, 'The most disgraceful and wicked name before Allah is a person calling himself Malikul-Amlak (King of Kings).'\"Therefore, the revelation Muhammad received, which he wants us Christians to believe, did not come from the God we believe in, Jesus Christ. Instead, according to the authentic Islamic books, it originated from being played with by Satan. Therefore, to us, he becomes a false prophet and messenger.The Holy Bible has warned us to test the apostles and prophets. In Revelation 2:1-2, \"To the angel of the church in Ephesus write: These are the words of him who holds the seven stars in his right hand and walks among the seven golden lampstands. I know your deeds, your hard work, and your perseverance. I know that you cannot tolerate wicked people, that you have tested those who claim to be apostles but are not, and have found them false.\"According to these verses, Muhammad s.a.w does not deserve to be called a prophet and messenger of the true God, but he falls into the category of false prophets and apostles. He is not suitable for us.Contact us for questions, comments, or to seek advice:Shalom,Max Shimba, a servant of Jesus Christ, the Almighty God. Titus 2:13",

    "full_content": "THE HOLY TRINITY ACCORDING TO THE BIBLEFirst of all, it should be understood that Almighty God is very exalted, and we, as His creatures, find it difficult to comprehend Him as we wish. God is omnipotent; we cannot limit Him by saying He can do this and that He cannot do that. We cannot fully comprehend God until He fits into our understanding; we cannot know His limits and boundaries. The day a human being can fully understand God, He will cease to be God.What we can understand is how He has revealed Himself to us through His Holy Scriptures. It would be strange to start denying how God wants us to understand Him through His Word. Therefore, it is my intention to present the Scriptures as God wants us to understand Him.The Bible teaches that God is One but in Three Eternal Personalities.In the Book of Genesis 1:1-3, we read:\"In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.\"We can say there is 1. God and 2. His Spirit. Then the scriptures continue to say:\"And God said, 'Let there be light,' and there was light\" (Genesis 1:3).So, we see that according to these scriptures, there is God, His Spirit, and His Word.These are living Personalities, each independently functioning according to God's will.There is ample evidence in the Scriptures showing that these Persons of God have been active throughout human history.For example, in Genesis 6:3, we read:\"Then the LORD said, 'My Spirit will not contend with humans forever…'.\" So, the Spirit of God can contend.Isaiah 44:3:“…I will pour out my Spirit on your offspring….”The Spirit of God, as a living Person, can be grieved or offended by humans.Matthew 12:31:\"And so I tell you, every kind of sin and slander can be forgiven, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.\"Ephesians 4:30:\"And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.\"The Holy Spirit preached the gospel in the Old Testament through the prophets.The prophets spoke the Word of God under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.1 Peter 1:11:\"They were told that their messages were not for themselves, but for you. And now this Good News has been announced to you by those who preached in the power of the Holy Spirit sent from heaven….\"2 Peter 1:21:\"For prophecy never had its origin in the human will, but prophets, though human, spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.\"In Romans 8:26, we see that:“…the Spirit himself intercedes for us through wordless groans.”All these attributes of the Spirit tell us that the Holy Spirit of God is the living Person of God's operation. In other words, the Holy Spirit is God Himself.Jesus Himself said:\"God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in truth\" (John 4:24).Who is the Word of God in the Bible?The Holy Scriptures (the Bible) tell us that God created the heavens and the earth by His Word. When you read Genesis 1:4-31, you will find that God spoke the Word of creation, and it came into being. Psalm 33:6 says:\"By the word of the LORD the heavens were made, their starry host by the breath of his mouth.\"When we carefully examine the scriptures, we discover that the Word of God is alive and powerful (read Hebrews 4:12) and has the power to give life. In this sense, we can conclude that, just as the Spirit of God is a living Personality, so is the Word of God.As we saw, the act of creation was carried out by the Word of God, the second Person of the Godhead. Throughout the Bible, there is evidence of this cooperation between God, His Word, and His Spirit in creation. The Word Himself says in Proverbs 8:22-30 about His participation in the work of creation:\"The LORD brought me forth as the first of his works, before his deeds of old; I was formed long ages ago, at the very beginning, when the world came to be…then I was constantly at his side. I was filled with delight day after day, rejoicing always in his presence.\"The Bible is very clear that this Word who created the heavens and the earth is also God. This is because you cannot separate God from His Word and say God is God and His Word is not God but something different. God and His Word are One. We read in John 1:1-3 that:\"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God…through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made.\"Throughout the Bible, we see the Word actively working and being given the attribute of a living Personality of God.Now the time comes to fulfill another great work of redeeming fallen humanity. As always in God's work, the principal actor is “His Word.” So, God sent His Word to complete the work of redemption.The Word became flesh to accomplish human redemption.God's principle regarding redemption is that:\"Without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness\" (Hebrews 9:22).Thus, we see that:“…since the children have flesh and blood, he too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might break the power of him who holds the power of death—that is, the devil” (Hebrews 2:14).Therefore, to redeem humanity:\"The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth\" (John 1:14).This act of the Word agreeing to become flesh is what led to Him being called the \"Son of God.\" As we saw in the above scripture, it is not in a physical sense as humans procreate. God Himself declared after the Word became flesh that:“You are my Son; today I have become your Father.” And again, “I will be his Father, and he will be my Son.” (Hebrews 1:5).\"And a voice from heaven said, 'This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased'\" (Matthew 3:17).By the Word becoming flesh, we then have the title of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. This is due to the fact that the act of the Word becoming flesh does not strip Him of His divinity. What we can see here is that the Word of God took on flesh, leading to a union of the Word (God) and flesh (Man). In Jesus, there is the fullness of God in His divinity and the fullness of humanity in His human body. The Word (Jesus) Himself says:\"...sacrifices and offerings you did not desire, but a body you prepared for me; with burnt offerings and sin offerings you were not pleased. Then I said, 'Here I am—it is written about me in the scroll—I have come to do your will, my God.'\" (Hebrews 10:5-7).We see that the Word was given a body, took on humanity, and we saw Him with all the attributes of humanity. But by His nature:“…being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness.” (Philippians 2:6-7).In this union, He was born of a woman, and the angel told Mary, who was to bear the Son, that:\"You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you are to call him Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High (that is, God)…The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So, the holy one to be born will be called the Son of God.\" (Luke 1:31-32, 35).Later, the angel Gabriel told Joseph, Mary's fiancé, the same words he told Mary:\"She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins\" (Matthew 1:21).What confuses many is when the Word became flesh and appeared in the form of a human. In that form, Jesus had all the human needs, such as hunger, thirst, sleep, circumcision on the eighth day, tears, fatigue, etc., like any other human being.We need to understand that Jesus came to show us how to live a victorious life against sin by relying on God as human beings. The scriptures testify that He was tempted as we are tempted, yet without sin. He had no blemish throughout His life. The Holy Scriptures say:\"But we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are—yet he did not sin\" (Hebrews 4:15).\"He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth\" (1 Peter 2:22).In His human state, He relied on God for everything. This is why you will see that He prayed to God the Father, and you will also see that He made statements like:\"...do not hold on to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them, 'I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God'\" (John 20:17).In the state of divinity that was within Him (the Word of God), He said statements such as:\"I and the Father are one\" (John 10:30).\"Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father\" (John 14:9).\"Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; or at least believe on the evidence of the works themselves\" (John 14:11).How was the Father in Jesus? By the Word that took on the human body; the Word of God was in the flesh, and the flesh was in the Word of God. That is Jesus.In this state, it is not surprising to call Jesus God, and indeed, He is not only God but:\"...Christ Jesus, our great God and Savior\" (Titus 2:13).Thus, the concept of the Holy Trinity (one God in three Persons) is very evident within the Holy Scriptures, and there is no need for much argument, except to deny the scriptures. As I said earlier, we humans should not dictate to God how He should be and how He should not be. What we can do is to receive by faith how He has revealed Himself to us and what He has shown us. The scriptures say:\"The secret things belong to the LORD our God, but the things revealed belong to us and to our children forever...\" (Deuteronomy 29:29).Up to this point, we have seen in the Bible that God is One but has revealed Himself to us in three Persons of His operation. In the Old Testament, these Persons are God, His Word, and His Spirit, and in the New Testament, after the Word became flesh, these Persons take on the title of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. Now let us turn to the Noble Quran and see if, 600 years later, God would change His revelations and teach otherwise.THE HOLY TRINITY ACCORDING TO THE NOBLE QURANSince in examining the Holy Trinity in the Bible, we started from the beginning during creation, we must follow the same approach for this subject.The Holy Spirit according to the Noble Quran.Just as in the Bible, the Noble Quran agrees that God created the heavens and the earth in six days.\"It is He who created the heavens and the earth in six days—and His Throne was upon the water—that He might test you as to which of you is best in deed. But if you were to say, 'You are indeed to be raised up after death,' those who disbelieve would surely say, 'This is not but obvious magic'\" (Surah 11:7, HUD).Abdalla Farsy, a Swahili commentator of the Quran, explains in his commentary on this verse:“And saying that the heavens and the earth were created in six days, God knows Himself, what exactly those six days are according to His own calculation. And that Throne of God we do not know nor do we know about the WATER upon which the Throne was” (Abdalla Farsy, Tafsiri ya Quran Tukufu, Surah 11:7).It appears that the interpreters of the Quran fail to understand these words about God's creation. But they should not struggle; what they need to do is follow the advice given within the Noble Quran itself. In Surah 10:94, we read:\"So if you are in doubt about what We have revealed to you, then ask those who have been reading the Scripture before you (the Jews and the Christians)\" (Surah 10:94).To understand those days of creation and how the Throne of God was upon the water at that time of creation, one needs to read the Bible as we saw earlier. The Bible states that the days consist of \"evening and morning,\" making up a day (read Genesis 1). Morning and evening can only occur within a 24-hour period. Thus, those six days are days of 24 hours each. The Bible also says:\"For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but He rested on the seventh day. Therefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy\" (Exodus 20:11).\"Thus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array. By the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing; so on the seventh day he rested from all his work\" (Genesis 2:1-2).The Quran also agrees with the Bible that God was upon the water during creation. According to the Bible, it was the Spirit of God that was hovering over the surface of the waters (Genesis 1:2).Many verses in the Quran show that the Spirit of God is sent from God to strengthen His servants (Prophets), for example:\"He sends down the angels with the Spirit by His command upon whom He wills of His servants, (saying), 'Warn that there is no deity except Me; so fear Me'\" (Surah 16:2, An-Nahl).\"Exalted above (all) degrees, (He is) the Possessor of the Throne. He places the Spirit of His command upon whom He wills of His servants to warn of the Day of Meeting\" (Surah 40:15, Al-Mu'min).Many Quranic commentators like Abdalla Farsy interpret the word “spirit” (rooh) used in these verses of the Quran to mean Revelation or Message or Prophethood that God gives to His prophets. This verse of Surah 40:15 in Abdalla Farsy's commentary reads:\"He is the Exalted in ranks, the Possessor of the Throne. He sends down the Revelation of His command upon whom He wills of His servants to warn of the Day of Meeting\" (Abdalla Farsy, Tafsiri ya Quran Tukufu, Surah 40:15).Here, the Arabic word \"rooh\" (spirit) is interpreted as \"wahyi\" (revelation). Perhaps to avoid the direct understanding that God sends His Holy Spirit to the prophets and messengers to give the warning messages. However, this still agrees with the concept we saw in the Bible that prophets delivered their messages under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.\"For prophecy never had its origin in the human will, but prophets, though human, spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit\" (2 Peter 1:21).Jesus Himself, after becoming flesh (in His humanity), both the Bible and the Quran testify that He was strengthened by the power of the Holy Spirit to perform many miracles.\"And We gave Moses the Book and followed him up with a succession of messengers. And We gave Jesus, the son of Mary, clear proofs and supported him with the Holy Spirit. But is it (not) that every time a messenger came to you (Israelites) with what your souls did not desire, you were arrogant? And a party (of messengers) you denied and another party you killed\" (Surah 2:87, Al-Baqara).\"When Allah will say, 'O Jesus, son of Mary, remember My favor upon you and upon your mother when I supported you with the Pure Spirit and you spoke to the people in the cradle and in maturity; and when I taught you writing and wisdom and the Torah and the Gospel; and when you designed from clay (what was) like the form of a bird with My permission, then you breathed into it, and it became a bird with My permission; and you healed the blind and the leper with My permission; and when you brought forth the dead with My permission; and when I restrained the Children of Israel from (killing) you when you came to them with clear proofs, and those who disbelieved among them said, 'This is nothing but obvious magic'\" (Surah 5:110, Al-Ma'ida).These words are also found in the Bible, that Jesus was empowered by the Holy Spirit. Jesus said:\"The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to set the oppressed free\" (Luke 4:18).The lack of detailed explanations about the Holy Spirit and His work in the Quran does not mean that there is no Person of God called the Holy Spirit. This absence might be because the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) himself was revealed to:\"And they ask you, (O Muhammad), about the Spirit. Say, 'The Spirit is of the affair of my Lord. And mankind has not been given of knowledge except a little'\" (Surah 17:85, Al-Israa).According to this verse, Allah (SWT) says that Muhammad was given only a little knowledge about the matters concerning the Holy Spirit. However, even this little knowledge, when read in the light of the Holy Bible, we can see the consistent chain of teaching about the Holy Spirit.After seeing the presence of the Holy Spirit from God within the Noble Quran, let us now look at the \"Word of God\" and His work within the Quran.The Word from Almighty God according to the Noble QuranIn the Bible, we saw that the Word of God created the heavens and the earth. Is there any difference in the Quran? No, we read in Surah 2:117:\"The Originator of the heavens and the earth. When He decrees a matter, He only says to it, 'Be,' and it is\" (Surah 2:117, Al-Baqara).These words completely align with the words in the Holy Bible that:\"By the word of the LORD the heavens were made, their starry host by the breath of his mouth ... For he spoke, and it came to be; he commanded, and it stood firm\" (Psalm 33:6,9).Thus, we see that both the Bible and the Quran agree that the heavens and the earth were created by the Word of God. In the Bible, we saw that this Word became flesh and lived among us. Can we find evidence in the Quran that the Word became flesh?The Word that became flesh according to the Noble QuranIn Surah 3:45, we read:\"(Remember) when the angels said, 'O Mary, indeed Allah gives you good tidings of a word from Him, whose name will be the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, distinguished in this world and the Hereafter and among those brought near (to Allah).\"In this verse, we are told that Prophet Jesus (Isa) is a Word from God, and He has honor in this world and the Hereafter. As He Himself said in Matthew 28:19, \"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.\"Throughout the Quran, Prophet Jesus (Isa) is described as the Word from God.Why then do Muslims deny the divinity of Jesus or the Holy Trinity, despite the abundant evidence within the Quran?To be truthful, there are no scriptures within the Quran that directly deny that Jesus or Prophet Isa is not God, or that reject the concept of the Holy Trinity, i.e., One God in three Persons (note that when the Quran says that God is One, it does not mean denying the Holy Trinity. The Bible also teaches that God is One, but this oneness is in three Persons as we saw in this study).Many explanations within the Quranic interpretations that deny the divinity of Jesus are enhanced by the explanations or teachings of the interpreters of the Quran. It is evident that these explanations by the interpreters contradict the Quran itself.Here, I will provide an example of a verse within the Quran that is often used to deny the divinity of Jesus or the Holy Trinity. I will present four (4) Swahili translations of this verse to show how Islamic scholars struggle to conceal the divinity of Jesus. The verse is Surah 4:171.Translation by Aliy Muhsin Barwaani (Sunni):\"O People of the Scripture! Do not commit excess in your religion or say about Allah except the truth. The Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, was but a Messenger of Allah and His Word which He directed to Mary and a soul (created at a command) from Him. So believe in Allah and His messengers. And do not say, 'Three'; desist—it is better for you. Indeed, Allah is but one God. Exalted is He above having a son. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And sufficient is Allah as Disposer of affairs.\"The Holy Quran (Along with Translation and Commentary in Swahili) (Ahmadiyya):(O here it is made verse 172)\"O People of the Scripture! Do not exceed the limits in your religion, nor say about Allah except the truth. The Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, was but a Messenger of Allah and His Word which He directed to Mary and a soul (created at a command) from Him. So believe in Allah and His messengers. And do not say, 'Three'; desist—it is better for you: for Allah is only one God. Far exalted is He above having a son. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth. And Allah is sufficient as a Disposer of affairs.\"Translation by Ali bin Jumaa bin Mayunga (Shia):\"O People of the Scripture! Do not exceed the limits in your religion, nor say about Allah except the truth. The Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, was but a Messenger of Allah and His Word which He directed to Mary and a soul (created at a command) from Him. So believe in Allah and His messengers. And do not say, 'Three'; desist—it is better for you. Indeed, Allah is only one God. Exalted is He above having a son. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth, and Allah is sufficient as a Disposer of affairs.\"Translation by Abdallah Farsy (Sunni):\"O People of the Scripture! Do not exceed the limits in your religion, nor say about Allah except the truth. The Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, was but a Messenger of Allah and (a creature created by) His command (of Allah) which He directed to Mary, and a soul (created at a command) from Him (Allah like any other soul). So believe in Allah and His messengers. And do not say, 'Three'; desist (from that belief); it will be better for you. For Allah is only one God. Exalted is He above having a son. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth, and Allah is sufficient as a Disposer of affairs.\"Analysis of These Translations:I have brought this verse in different translations of the Quran to illustrate the intended meaning of this verse. When you carefully read the translation by Sheikh Balwaniy, you will find that this verse informs us of three attributes of Prophet Jesus (Isa), namely:Prophet Jesus is a Messenger of Allah (meaning he was sent by God).Prophet Jesus is the Word from Allah directed to Mary.Prophet Jesus is a soul from Allah.The attribute of being sent by God the Father.The attribute that Jesus is the Word from God the Father.The attribute that Jesus is the Spirit of God.These three attributes of Jesus are not denied by the Holy Bible as follows:\"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him\" (John 3:16-17).\"The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth\" (John 1:14).\"God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in truth\" (John 4:24).It is impossible to separate God from His Spirit and His Word. If God is Spirit, then it is correct to say that the Word is also Spirit.All three translations of the Quran I presented here—Sheikh Balwaniy, Ahmadiyya, and Mayunga—agree in the explanation of this verse. These three translators have translated word for word from Arabic in this Surah 4:171. Now let's also examine the translation of Sheikh Abdallah Farsy.\"O People of the Scripture! Do not exceed the limits in your religion, nor say about Allah except the truth. The Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, was but a Messenger of Allah and (a creature created by) His command (of Allah) which He directed to Mary, and a soul (created at a command) from Him (Allah like any other soul). So believe in Allah and His messengers. And do not say, 'Three'; desist (from that belief); it will be better for you. For Allah is only one God. Exalted is He above having a son. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth, and Allah is sufficient as a Disposer of affairs.\"At first glance, when you analyze this translation, you will find that Sheikh Abdallah Farsy plays a word game. All the words he placed in parentheses ( ) are his additions to guide the reader to understand what he wants it to be. You will find that this translation is intentionally made to protect the Islamic belief that Allah is one, He neither begets nor is He begotten.\"(Saying: 'He is Allah, [who is] One. Allah, the Eternal Refuge. He neither begets nor is born, nor is there to Him any equivalent')\" (Surah 112:1-4, Al-Ikhlas).This Surah is the most important Surah in the Quran for Muslims. It seems that from childhood, they are required to memorize this Surah. The first pillar in Islam is the Shahada, which is to testify that \"There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is His Messenger.\"It seems that the entire Islamic system is built on denying the concept of the Holy Trinity.Unfortunately, Muslims oppose this without having a thorough understanding of this concept of the Holy Trinity. Sometimes they have created a belief that does not even exist among Christians themselves and implanted it in their followers, making Christians appear as they are not, i.e., that Christians believe in three gods.As we have seen in this study, this belief is entirely contrary to Christianity; Christians do not believe in three gods, and this teaching is not from the Bible, but Christians believe in one God who exists in Three Living Persons, and this is what we call the HOLY TRINITY.Let's return to the translation of Abdallah Farsy. Let's look at these words he placed in parentheses ( ).\"The Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, was but a Messenger of Allah and (a creature created by) His command (of Allah) which He directed to Mary.\"Abdallah Farsy here is creating his own sentence by mixing the words of the Noble Quran to call them the Words of Allah. These words mean something completely different from the words of the Quran, which are:\"The Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, was but a Messenger of Allah and His Word which He directed to Mary, and a soul from Him.\"He continues to add his words to distort the translation by saying:\"And a soul from Him (Allah like any other soul).\"Abdallah Farsy wants us to understand here that there are other souls that have come from Allah, so it is not surprising for Prophet Isa. In other words, this Sheikh wants to teach us that God has a “store” or warehouse of human souls which He releases and implants in humans. These words he placed in parentheses are not in the Arabic language in that verse, which is why you will find that the Sheikhs who translated word for word did not include those words.As in the Bible, the word itself, the Holy Trinity, does not appear in the entire Quran, but by carefully examining the Bible and the Quran, we can see that this concept of the Holy Trinity is a teaching of the Holy Books. Both books agree that there is One Unique God who has no partner in all His works, and He exists in Three Living Persons of His operation: God, the Word of God, and the Holy Spirit of God. When it came time to redeem humanity, the Word became flesh, and thus we receive the titles of these Three Persons of God, namely, God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit.Shalom,Dr. Max Shimba",

There is no intercessor except after His permission. That is Allah, your Lord, so worship Him. Then will you not remember?\"However, dear brothers and sisters, upon further examination of the Quran, I discovered that Allah lied when He said that He created the earth in six days. Now join me in examining the creation of the earth as it is more clearly explained in the Quran, which was revealed by Jibril.Now we will readSurah 41:9-12. In these verses, you will discover that Allah did not create the earth in six days as He initially claimed.THE CONTRADICTION BEGINS HERE:THIS VERSE SAYS ALLAH CREATED IN TWO DAYS (2)Quran 41:9: \"Say, 'Do you indeed disbelieve in He who created the earth in two days and attribute to Him equals? That is the Lord of the worlds.'\"[ADD]HERE ALLAH JOINS THE CLOUDS AND EARTH IN FOUR DAYS (4)Quran 41:10: \"And He placed on the earth firmly set mountains over its surface, and He blessed it and determined therein its [creatures'] sustenance in four days without distinction – for [the information] of those who ask.\"[ADD]HERE ALLAH CREATES THE HEAVENS IN TWO DAYS (2)Quran 41:12: \"And He completed them as seven heavens within two days and inspired in each heaven its command. And We adorned the nearest heaven with lamps [i.e., stars] and as protection. That is the determination of the Exalted in Might, the Knowing.\"ALL THESE TOGETHER TOTAL EIGHT DAYS (8)Two days for the creation of the earth, then four days to fill the earth with mountains, blessings, and sustenance for its inhabitants, and finally two more days to create the seven heavens and their stars. This adds up to 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 days, contrary to the six days mentioned in other verses.LET ME SUMMARIZE BRIEFLY:The structure is very clear: These are three levels of creation from bottom to top:Quran 41:9: The heavens [sky, \"roof\" above the earth] in two days---------- ADDQuran 41:10: BLESSINGS [filling the earth with everything needed for life] in four days--------- ADDQuran 41:12: EARTH [foundation] completed in two daysDear brothers and sisters, did Allah fail at mathematics, or is this confirming that He was not the Creator?Today, Allah has once again assured us that He is not the Creator. The choice is yours: to follow Allah, who does not know how many days it took to create the earth, or Yahweh, who said He created the earth in six days.ShalomDr. Max Shimba for Max Shimba Ministries Org",

Its verses lack logical flow. Each verse stands on its own and does not relate to the preceding or following verse.In one verse, Allah commands his followers to strike non-Muslims, while in another, he commands them to forgive.

Are these claims true?In several Surahs, the Quran confuses Mary, the mother of Isa [Miriam in Hebrew], with Miriam, the sister of Aaron and Moses, and the daughter of Amram, who lived about 1600 years earlier.Finally, she (Mary) brought him (the baby) to her people, carrying him. They said, \"O Mary! Indeed, you have brought a thing unprecedented. O sister of Aaron, your father was not a man of evil, nor was your mother unchaste.\"-- Surah 19:27-28And Mary, daughter of Imran...-- Surah 66:12I understand what Muslims claim to be the solution to this problem. Yusuf Ali, for example, writes in his footnote 2481, explaining the above verse: “Aaron, the brother of Moses, was the first in the line of Israelite priests. 'Sisters of Aaron' or 'daughters of Imran (who was the father of Aaron).'”This is a misconception. Only Aaron was made a priest of the Lord and indeed the first High Priest. Only Aaron's descendants became priests. Neither Moses nor their sister Miriam are ever understood to be in the \"priestly line.\" Amram is certainly not a priest. If Mary's lineage as part of the priestly family was to be emphasized, she must be called the daughter of Aaron since all the priests of Israel are descendants of Aaron, while his siblings are not counted among the priestly line.I acknowledge that the terms \"father,\" \"daughter,\" and \"sister\" can sometimes be used loosely to indicate a general family relationship. Therefore, we must carefully read each mention to see what it means. The Quran makes it clear that the specific, physical meaning of daughter and (therefore) sister is intended in this matter, as I will show below. Even if there was no concern about the issue of \"priesthood\" and a broader family relationship was viewed, why does the Quran not say \"daughter of Aaron,\" who is more famous? Although the term \"sister\" can be used more broadly than a sister in a close family, isn't it standard usage even in Islam that \"brothers and sisters\" live in nearly the same generation (like cousins) while \"father and daughter\" indicate a generational difference between the two? Why call her the sister of the famous Aaron (1400 years older than Mary) instead of the daughter of `Imran (Biblically Amram), whose only mention is in genealogical tables in Exodus 6 and 1 Chronicles 23? This seems clear that the two Miriams were indeed confused. But attempts to harmonize seem not very logical.The above points are only some of the \"smaller questions.\" The larger problem is that the Quran clearly does not speak of a broad genealogical relationship as we see in the following verse.Remember! The wife of Imran said: \"O my Lord! I dedicate to You what is in my womb for Your service... When she delivered, she said: \"O my Lord! I have delivered a female child!\" \"... And I have named her Mary...\"-- Surah 3:35-36Muslims are generally very precise about who is the wife of whom, and it is certainly not allowed that anyone can just make love to a woman because she is \"more his sister.\" If Mary is a female child from the womb of the wife of `Imran, then she is directly the daughter of Imran and there is no doubt that the theory of a \"distant lineage\" is contradicted by the Quran itself.Yusuf Ali in his footnote 375 to Surah 3:35 even goes further by concocting (?) a second Imran by claiming that “by tradition, Mary's mother was called Hanna... and her father was called Imran,” to somehow save the Quran from this conflict. But the same tradition that names Mary's mother as Hanna also names her father as Joachim. Why does Yusuf Ali accept one part of this tradition (e.g., in the Proto-Evangelion of James the Less) and reject another?Yusuf Ali provides no reference for this \"tradition\" he refers to. Until I see any reference for this, there is no reason to accept this theory. To my current knowledge, there was no such tradition preceding Muhammad. Some Islamic commentators may have created something later to explain this very issue, but a late theory/\"tradition\" is not very reliable.And a final question:Is there any other instance in the Quran where someone is repeatedly called the daughter [son] or sister [brother] of people who are more distant relatives?Even if there were one such name in the lineage that was so strong that everyone is referred to in relation to that one person, it is doubly unlikely that anyone would be called in relation to two distant relatives instead of \"father\" and \"brother,\" and never mentioned in relation to their actual parents or siblings. If this is the only instance, then the explanations of Muslims become more difficult since emergency explanations, i.e., explanations that have no purpose other than to explain this one problem but are not used elsewhere, are not very reliable. It appears like a makeshift argument in this case. And the fact that Aaron is the son of Imran and this is a direct and correct genealogical relationship also shows that all others are understood as daughter and sister in the usual, everyday meaning.Thomas Patrick Hughes in his book \"A Dictionary of Islam,\" page 328, writes on this issue that \"it certainly is the cause of some perplexity for commentators. Al-Baidawi says she was called `sister of Aaron' because she was of the tribe of Levi; but Husein says that the Aaron mentioned in the verse is not the same person as the brother of Moses.\"As usual, conflicting explanations are evidence that there is indeed a problem in the Quran and no clear and satisfactory solution is found.Note: Moses and Aaron are called \"Moses ibnImran\" and \"Aaron ibnImran\" in the Hadith, just as Mary is called \"Maryam ibnat `Imran\" in Surah 66:12.Shalom,Dr. Max Shimba for Max Shimba Ministries",

Indeed, Muhammad had many enemies.How was he killed?There are many possible ways: some could have used poison, others a knife, a club, or pushing him off a cliff, etc.What is interesting is that the Quran tells us how Allah would have killed Muhammad.Quran 69:44-46And if he (Muhammad) had forged a false saying concerning us,We surely would have seized him by his right hand,Then We would certainly have cut off his life artery (Aorta).Let's see some interpretations of this verse as translated by various scholars.Quran 69:44-46If he (Muhammad) had forged a false saying concerning us, We would surely have seized him by his right hand (or with power and might), and then certainly should have cut off his life artery (Aorta). (Hilal-Khan)And if (Muhammad) had invented lies against Us, We would certainly have seized him by the right hand, then We would certainly have cut off his life artery. (Pickthall)Had he invented lies concerning Us, we would have seized him by the right hand and severed his heart's vein. (Dawood)If he had fabricated against Us, some of the sayings, We should certainly have seized him by the right hand, then We would certainly have cut off his Aorta. (Shakir)All these interpretations mean the same thing.Therefore, according to the Quran, if Muhammad had fabricated revelations, Allah would have killed him by cutting his life artery (Aorta).Now let's see what the Hadith says about Muhammad being poisoned by a Jewish woman.Sahih Al-Bukhari 2617A Jewess brought a poisoned (cooked) sheep for the prophet who ate from it. She was brought to the Prophet and was asked, \"Shall we kill her?\" He said, \"No\". Anas added: \"I continued to see the effect of the poison on the palate of Allah's Messenger.\"Translation:A Jewish woman brought poisoned cooked meat to the Prophet, who ate from it. She was brought to the Prophet and questioned, \"Shall we kill her?\" The Prophet said, \"No\". Anas added, \"I continued to see the effect of the poison on the palate of Allah's Messenger.\"Sahih Muslim 5430A Jewess came to Allah's Messenger with poisoned mutton, and he took of what had been brought to him. (When the effect of this poison was felt by him), he called for her and asked her about that, whereupon she said: \"I had determined to kill you.\" Thereupon he said: \"Allah will never give you the power to do it.\"Translation:A Jewish woman came to Allah's Messenger with poisoned mutton, and he took what was brought to him. (When he felt the effect of this poison), he called for her and asked her, whereupon she said: \"I had determined to kill you.\" Thereupon he said: \"Allah will never give you the power to do it.\"You see? Muhammad confidently tells the woman that Allah will not allow her to kill him, but unfortunately, the poison killed him. Why did the woman want to kill Muhammad?The answer to this question is found in the Hadith of Ibn Sa'd, Volume 2, pp. 251-252The Apostle of Allah sent for Zaynab bint Al-Harith and said to her: \"What induced you to do what you have done?\" She replied: \"You have done to my people what you have done. You have killed my father, my uncle, and my husband, so I said to myself, if you are a prophet, the foreleg will inform you; and others have said: if you are a king, we will get rid of you.\"The Prophet of God sent for Zaynab bint Al-Harith and said to her, \"What made you do what you did?\" She replied, \"You have done to my people what you have done. You killed my father, my uncle, and my husband, so I said to myself, if you are a prophet, the foreleg will inform you; and others have said, if you are a king, we will get rid of you.\"Ibn Sa'd, Volume 2, pp. 251-252So you see, the woman killed Muhammad because he had killed her family. However, Zaynab was not alone in this; she had a partner in the plot.Sahih Al-Bukhari 4428The Prophet in his ailment in which he died, used to say, \"O Aisha! I still feel the pain caused by the food I ate at Khaibar, and at this time, I feel as if my aorta is being cut from that poison.\"Translation:The Prophet, in his ailment in which he died, used to say, \"O Aisha! I still feel the pain caused by the food I ate at Khaibar, and at this time, I feel as if my aorta is being cut from that poison.\"Sunan Abu Dawud 4498A Jewess presented (Muhammad) at Khaibar with a roasted sheep which she had poisoned. The Apostle of Allah ate of it, and the people also ate. He then said: \"Lift your hands (from eating), for it has informed me that it is poisoned.\" Bishr al-Bara b. Ma'rur al-Ansari died. So he (the Prophet) sent for the Jewess (and said to her): \"What motivated you to do the work you have done?\" She said: \"If you were a prophet, it would not harm you; but if you were a king, I would rid the people of you.\" The Apostle of Allah then ordered regarding her, and she was killed. He then said about the pain of which he died: \"I continued to feel pain from the morsel which I had eaten at Khaibar. This is the time when it has cut off my aorta.\"Translation:A Jewish woman presented poisoned roasted sheep to Muhammad at Khaibar. The Apostle of Allah ate from it, and the people also ate. He then said: \"Lift your hands (from eating), for it has informed me that it is poisoned.\" Bishr al-Bara b. Ma'rur al-Ansari died. So he (the Prophet) sent for the Jewess and asked her, \"What motivated you to do the work you have done?\" She said: \"If you were a prophet, it would not harm you; but if you were a king, I would rid the people of you.\" The Apostle of Allah then ordered her to be killed. He then said about the pain from which he died: \"I continued to feel pain from the morsel I had eaten at Khaibar. This is the time when it has cut off my aorta.\"You start to get the picture here. Did anyone in the Quran say they would cut Muhammad's main artery?Quran 69:44-46And if he (Muhammad) had forged a false saying concerning us,We surely would have seized him by his right hand,Then We would certainly have cut off his life artery (Aorta).You see? You can connect the dots here.We have also seen one of Muhammad's companions, Bishr b. Al-Bara b. Ma'rur al-Ansar, dying after eating the poison.But before he died, he told Muhammad that as soon as he put the piece of meat in his mouth, he felt the poison, but he continued to eat because he saw the Messenger of Allah, Muhammad, eating.Ibn Sa'd, Volume 2, pp. 252-252The Apostle of Allah, may Allah bless him, took the foreleg, a piece of which he put into his mouth. Bishr ibn al-Bara took another bone and put it into his mouth. When the Apostle of Allah, may Allah bless him, ate one morsel of it, Bishr ate his, and other people also ate from it. Then the Apostle of Allah, may Allah bless him, said: \"Hold back your hands! Because this foreleg; and according to another version, the shoulder of the goat, has informed me that it is poisoned.\" Thereupon Bishr said: \"By Him who hath made you great! I discovered it from the morsel I took. Nothing prevented me from emitting it out, but the idea that I did not like to make your food unappetizing. When you had eaten what was in your mouth, I did not like to save my life after yours, and I also thought you would not have eaten it if there was something wrong.\" Bishr did not rise from his seat but his color changed to that of Taylsan (a green cloth).The Apostle of Allah, may Allah bless him, took the foreleg, a piece of which he put into his mouth. Bishr ibn al-Bara took another bone and put it into his mouth. When the Apostle of Allah, may Allah bless him, ate one morsel of it, Bishr ate his, and other people also ate from it. Then the Apostle of Allah, may Allah bless him, said: \"Hold back your hands! Because this foreleg; and according to another version, the shoulder of the goat, has informed me that it is poisoned.\" Thereupon Bishr said: \"By Him who hath made you great!

When you had eaten what was in your mouth, I did not like to save my life after yours, and I also thought you would not have eaten it if there was something wrong.\" Bishr did not rise from his seat but his color changed to that of Taylsan (a green cloth).Ibn Sa'd, Volume 2, pp. 251-252So Bishr died because he trusted Muhammad, believing him to be a prophet and thinking he would detect the poison.Muhammad explained his pain to Bishr's mother.Sahih Abu Dawud 4449Umm Bishr said to the Prophet during the illness of which he died: \"What do you think about your illness, Apostle of Allah? I do not think about the illness of my son except the poisoned sheep of which he had eaten with you at Khaibar.\" The Prophet said: \"And I do not think about my illness except that. This is the time when it has cut off my aorta.\"Translation:Umm Bishr said to the Prophet during the illness of which he died: \"What do you think about your illness, Apostle of Allah? I do not think about the illness of my son except the poisoned sheep of which he had eaten with you at Khaibar.\" The Prophet said: \"And I do not think about my illness except that. This is the time when it has cut off my aorta.\"At-Tabari, Volume 8, p. 124The messenger of God said during the illness from which he died—the mother of Bishr b. Al-Bara had come to visit him—\"Umm Bishr, at this very moment I feel my aorta being severed because of the food I ate with your son at Khaibar.\"The messenger of God said during the illness from which he died—the mother of Bishr b. Al-Bara had come to visit him—\"Umm Bishr, at this very moment I feel my aorta being severed because of the food I ate with your son at Khaibar.\"At-Tabari, Volume 8, p. 124According to his wife Aisha, Muhammad was in severe pain before his death.Sunan Ibn Majah 1622Aisha said: \"I never saw anyone suffer more pain than the messenger of Allah.\"Translation:Aisha said: \"I never saw anyone suffer more pain than the Messenger of Allah.\"Sunan Ibn Majah 1622Sahih Al-Bukhari 2588Aisha said: \"When the Prophet became sick and his condition became serious, he requested his wives to allow him to be treated in my house, and they allowed him. He came out leaning on two men while his feet were dragging on the ground.\"Translation:Aisha said: \"When the Prophet became sick and his condition became serious, he requested his wives to allow him to be treated in my house, and they allowed him. He came out leaning on two men while his feet were dragging on the ground.\"Sahih Al-Bukhari 2588Now, since the Quran says that if Muhammad had been a false prophet, Allah would cut his main artery, and Muhammad admitted that his main artery (Aorta) was cut, we can conclude that Muhammad was not a true prophet.You might also wonder about Muhammad's judgment in accepting food from someone whose relatives he had killed.If Muhammad did not have the common sense to avoid food from someone whose family members he had killed, can he be trusted in anything he says?Moreover, Zaynab tested Muhammad, believing that if he was a true prophet, he would not die from the poison, but if he was a false prophet, he would die. Muhammad failed this test.Additionally, Muhammad's friend Bishr tasted the meat and realized it was poisoned but continued to eat because he saw Muhammad eating and trusted him.Lastly, when the Jews tried to kill Jesus, Allah intervened and saved him.Quran 4:157-158And for saying, \"We killed the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, the messenger of Allah.\" But they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him; but [another] was made to resemble him to them. And indeed, those who differ over it are in doubt about it. They have no knowledge of it except the following of assumption. And they did not kill him, for certain.Rather, Allah raised him to Himself. And ever is Allah Exalted in Might and Wise.It's remarkable that Allah saved Jesus from the Jews but allowed Muhammad to be killed by a single Jewish woman.In conclusion, Muhammad wanted to die as a martyr in battle but died from poison given by a woman.Sahih Bukhari 2797\"By Him in Whose Hands my life is! I would love to be martyred in Allah's cause and then be resurrected and then be martyred, and then be resurrected again and then be martyred, and then be resurrected again and then be martyred.\"Translation:\"By Him in Whose Hands my life is! I would love to be martyred in Allah's cause and then be resurrected and then be martyred, and then be resurrected again and then be martyred, and then be resurrected again and then be martyred.\"Sahih Bukhari 2797Unfortunately, Muhammad died from poison given by a woman.Remember, Muhammad received revelations from Allah whenever he needed them, whether it was meeting Aisha, marrying four wives, or marrying his adopted son's wife. Allah always fulfilled Muhammad's desires.Here, I am laying the foundation by looking at the surrounding details in the Quran. Later, I will start revealing the hidden teachings within the Quran. This journey will be long and requires great patience.I am not engaging in religious debates but trying to show you how Muhammad died and who killed him.Unlike what your religious leaders tell you to control your thoughts, this is about freeing your mind if you receive it with an open heart.ShaloomDr. Max Shimba for Max Shimba Ministries Org",

Invite people to the Way of Truth that your Lord has called your people to follow. And in your invitation, use the approach that suits each of them. Call those with high ranks among them with words of wisdom according to their understanding. And for the rest of the common people among them, call them by giving them relevant admonitions and using examples of the matters they deal with, guiding them to the Truth, and lead them on the straightforward path that suits them. And argue with the people of the previous religions, i.e., Jews and Christians, using intellectual arguments, logic, and gentle words, and good discussions, not harsh words and insults, to persuade and attract them. This is the way of Da'wah (invitation), calling people to approach Allah—people of all faiths. So follow this path when you call, and after that, leave the rest to your Lord, who knows who among them is deeply immersed in misguidance and far from the path of salvation, and who among them is safe, has been guided, and believes in what you have brought to them.ALLAH SAYS THAT CHRISTIANITY IS A PRECEDING RELIGION. SO ISLAM DID NOT EXIST BEFORE CHRISTIANITY.http://www.iium.edu.my/deed/quran/swahili/without/c16.htmIS IT TRUE THAT CHRISTIANITY AND THE CHURCH EXISTED BEFORE ISLAM?Let's read about Moses. Did he enter a CHURCH?Acts 7:37 This is the Moses who told the Israelites, ‘God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your own people.’38 He was in the assembly in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and with our ancestors; and he received living words to pass on to us.Moses answers Muslims by stating that he was in the Church when he was in the wilderness. Thus, Moses was not a Muslim, nor did he ever enter a Mosque.Shalom,Dr. Max Shimba for Max Shimba Ministries Org.",

    "full_content": "Dear reader,Often in Islamic lectures, Christianity is derided, claiming that Islam is the religion of Allah and Christianity is not a religion. These statements have deeply hurt Christians, especially when they are asked to provide a verse from the Bible that says Christianity is a religion.My dear friends, today I would like to address this weak and unfounded accusation against Christianity and the false claim that God has a religion.WHAT IS THE ORIGIN OF THE WORD CHRISTIANITY?The word Christianity derives from the name \"Christ.\" Therefore, a Christian is a follower of Christ. It's like saying a Tanzanian comes from Tanzania or the term Tanzanian derives from the union of \"U\" and \"Tanzania.\"The goal of a Christian is to seek close fellowship with God. This fellowship is made possible by the work of Jesus and the presence of the Holy Spirit in a Christian's life.The Holy God has no fellowship with sin and does not have a religion. Between Him and man, there is a great divide of sin. Man tries to reach God through many ways: RELIGION, good deeds, prayer, etc., but these are all insufficient. Man remains sinful.WHAT DOES CHRISTIANITY MEAN?Christianity is a unique faith compared to others because it focuses more on fellowship with God rather than religious acts. Contrary to adhering to a list of dos and don'ts, the goal of a Christian is to seek a close relationship with God the Father.Christians believe that the Bible is the Word of God and its teachings are the final authority (2 Timothy 3:16, 2 Peter 1:20-21). Christians believe in one God existing in the Trinity: the Father, the Son (Jesus Christ), and the Holy Spirit.WHAT DOES RELIGION MEAN?Religion is man's attempt to have a relationship with a Holy God despite being sinful. The Christian faith is a relationship with God because of what He has done for us through the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.CHRISTIANITY IS NOT A RELIGION BUT A UNIQUE FAITH THAT FOCUSES MORE ON FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD THAN RELIGIOUS ACTS THAT CANNOT LEAD TO HEAVEN.There is only one way to fellowship with God.JESUS CHRIST IS THE ONLY WAY TO REMOVE SIN.He died for us so that we may know God's love and plan for our lives.WHAT IS TRUE FAITH?True faith is not about focusing on laws but on principles. True faith is a relationship with God. Two things that all religions acknowledge are that man, in some way, is separated from God and needs to be reconciled with Him.False religions seek to solve this problem by keeping laws or rules. True faith solves the problem by recognizing that only God can fix the separation, and He already has. True faith recognizes the following:• All have sinned and are separated from God (Romans 3:23).• If not remedied, the just penalty for sin is death and eternal separation from God after death (Romans 6:23).• God came to us through Jesus Christ, died for us, took the penalty we deserved, and rose from the dead to prove that His death was a sufficient sacrifice (Romans 5:8; 1 Corinthians 15:3-4; 2 Corinthians 5:21).• If we receive Jesus as our Savior, believing His death as the full payment for our sins, we are forgiven, saved, redeemed, reconciled, and made righteous with God (John 3:16; Romans 10:9-10; Ephesians 2:8-9).Therefore, while other religions require their followers to perform or abstain from certain acts, Christianity is about having fellowship with God.Thus, Christianity is the followership of Christ, who is God. Jesus Christ is God.Max Shimba MinistriesCopyright © Max Shimba Ministries 2015",

This is another disaster for Muslims.How many names does Allah have, 99 or 100?NOW LET'S READ ABOUT THE GOD OF THE BIBLE:The God known asExodus 6:2-3,And God spoke to Moses and said to him, \"I am the LORD;And I appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as God Almighty, but by My name LORD I was not known to them.Do you see the difference between Allah and Jehovah in the Bible? Jehovah doesn't beat around the bush like Allah, who says He has beautiful names but fails to prove that JEHOVAH is His name.God said to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob 2668 years before Muhammad that His name is JEHOVAH, BUT ALLAH never said in the Quran that Jehovah is His name. THEREFORE ALLAH IS NOT THE GOD OF ABRAHAM, ISAAC, AND JACOB.Now, between the Almighty God who said in the Torah 2668 years before Muhammad that His name is JEHOVAH, AND Allah who failed to prove that He is Jehovah beyond saying He has beautiful names, whom should we believe?Remember, in the Old Testament alone, the NAME Jehovah is mentioned 6800 times, while in the Quran the name JEHOVAH is NOT mentioned even once.ALLAH CLAIMS THAT THE QURAN CONFIRMS THE TORAH, THE GOSPEL, AND THE PSALMS. ISN'T IT?LET'S READ THAT VERSE FIRST.Surah Al-Baqara 89. And when there came to them a Book from Allah confirming that which was with them — although before they used to pray for victory against those who disbelieved — but [then] when there came to them that which they recognized, they disbelieved in it; so the curse of Allah will be upon the disbelievers.Read more testimonies:Surah Al-Ma'ida 48. And We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad], the Book in truth, confirming that which preceded it of the Scripture and as a criterion over it. So judge between them by what Allah has revealed and do not follow their inclinations away from what has come to you of the truth. To each of you We prescribed a law and a method. Had Allah willed, He would have made you one nation [united in religion], but [He intended] to test you in what He has given you; so race to [all that is] good. To Allah is your return all together, and He will [then] inform you concerning that over which you used to differ.NOW, IF IT IS TRUE THAT THE QURAN CONFIRMS THE TORAH, PSALMS, AND GOSPEL,Why is there no Name Jehovah in the Quran?Why did Allah not say He is Jehovah to Muhammad?Why did Muhammad not ask Allah about this name Jehovah mentioned in the Torah, Psalms, and Gospel?Prove that Allah is a name with evidence from the verses. Thus, Allah has 100 names and not 99.Dear reader, it is very easy to catch Allah in His lie, because He claimed that the Quran confirms the Torah, Psalms, and Gospel, YET HE FAILED to prove that He is JEHOVAH.Therefore, Allah is not Jehovah, and the Quran does not confirm the Torah, Psalms, and Gospel.Based on the evidence above, I can say that ALLAH IS NOT GOD, ALLAH IS NOT JEHOVAH, MUHAMMAD IS A FALSE PROPHET, AND THE QURAN IS A FALSE BOOK FILLED WITH DOUBTS.If any Muslim disputes, then prove the following:Show me the Name Jehovah in the Quran.Show me the Name Yahuh in the Quran.Bring me a verse where Allah confirms that He is Jehovah, as He claimed that the Quran confirms the Torah, Psalms, and Gospel in Surah Al-Ma'ida 48.Prove that Allah is a name with evidence from the verses. Thus, Allah has 100 names and not 99.It is I, Max Shimba, a Servant of Jesus Christ the Almighty God.",

So whoever must swear should swear by Allah or be silent.\"Now let's read about Allah, who is not Jehovah \"Yahweh\", who does He swear by?Quran 91:1-7 Suratul Ash-Shams (The Sun)By the sun and its brightness. And [by] the moon when it follows it. And [by] the day when it displays it. And [by] the night when it covers it. And [by] the sky and He who constructed it. And [by] the earth and He who spread it. And [by] the soul and He who proportioned it.Quran 92:1-3 Suratul Al-Layl (The Night)By the night when it covers. And [by] the day when it appears. And [by] He who created the male and female.Here we see that Allah, worshipped by Muslims, swears by the sky and the one who built it, by the earth and the one who spread it.Who is the Spreader of the earth and the Builder of the sky?For Allah of Islam, swears by Him. Your answer is, God Jehovah created male and female, God Jehovah created Heaven and Earth, but Allah swears by the Creator of Heaven and Earth and by the Creator of male and female. Allah swears by Jehovah, the God of Christians.Who created male and female?QURAN 92:1-3By the night when it covers, 2 and by the day when it appears, 3. and by He who created the male and female...When someone swears by another, is he a god or a human?Who created them then? Because Allah swears by the Creator, and creating is a characteristic of God. So Allah did not create.Who is this Creator of male and female whom Allah of Islam swears by?Continue reading... from the Holy Bible…Jeremiah 27:5 I have made the earth, the man and the beasts that are upon the ground, by my great power and by my outstretched arm; and I give them unto whom it seems meet unto me.Now we read about Jehovah, the God of the Bible, that He is the one who created everything, including male and female whom Allah of Islam swears by. Therefore, Jehovah created male and female, and Allah of Islam swears by Him, so you yourself fill in who is God?Can God swear by another? Keep getting knowledge…Hebrews 6:13 When God made his promise to Abraham, since there was no one greater for him to swear by, he swore by himself,Jehovah says there is no one greater than Himself to swear by, but Allah in the Quran says that He swears by the one who created male and female.So today we understand that the Creator is Jehovah and Allah swears by Jehovah, the God of the Bible and Christians.God bless you abundantlyMax Shimba MinistriesCopyright © Max Shimba Ministries 2013",

    "full_content": "GOD IS IMPARTIAL, BUT ALLAH IS PARTIAL—FAVORING ONLY THE ARABSBy Dr. Max Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteWednesday, May 4, 2022When you first learned the truth about Jehovah, the God of the Bible, and understood His divine purpose, your faith began to grow. You realized that although you were born in sin and separated from God, the Father, through Jesus Christ, opened the way for you to attain the perfection that Adam lost and to receive the gift of eternal life.The Bible, written more than six hundred and fifty years before the birth and establishment of the Qur’an, clearly teaches thatGod shows no favoritism.As it is written:Romans 2:11– “For there is no respect of persons with God.”Acts 10:34– “Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons.”This is the essence of Jehovah’s divine character: our God loves all people equally, without discrimination or favoritism.However, when I read the Qur’an, I discovered thatAllahexhibits clear favoritism toward a specific group of people—particularly the Arabs—and expresses disdain toward others.A reference from the Qur’an,Surah Al-Ma’idah 5:3, declares:“Forbidden to you are carrion, blood, the flesh of swine, and that which has been dedicated to other than Allah, and the strangled, the beaten to death, the fallen, the gored, and that which wild beasts have eaten—except what you are able to slaughter before death—and that which has been sacrificed on stone altars. Also forbidden is dividing (meat) by raffling with arrows; that is defiance. This day those who disbelieve have despaired of your religion, so fear them not, but fear Me. This day I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favor upon you, and chosen for you Islam as your religion. But whoever is forced by hunger without inclination to sin—then indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.”(Surah Al-Ma’idah 5:3)This verse reveals that Allah“has chosen Islam for you,”addressing specifically the Arabian community. Hence, Islam emerges as a religion of favoritism—a faith designed for the Arabs and imposed upon others. This raises an important theological question:When did God, the Creator of all humanity, ever show such partiality or enmity toward other peoples?The God of the Bible stands in complete contrast. Scripture declares:“For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.”—John 3:16–17Jehovah’s love embraces all humanity—Jews, Arabs, Africans, Asians, and every nation under heaven. His salvation through Christ is universal, not ethnic or regional.Therefore, the Gospel must be proclaimed to all nations, as it is written:“And this Gospel of the Kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.”—Matthew 24:14Let us, therefore, dedicate ourselves to the Great Commission—bringing the message of salvation through Jesus Christ to all people everywhere.ForJesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.—Hebrews 13:8May God bless you all.By Dr. Max Shimba, Servant of Jesus Christ, our Great God and Savior.—Titus 2:13For Max Shimba Ministries Org© 2016 Max Shimba Ministries Org.

    "full_content": "Friday, January 21, 2022The Disobedience of Some Companions of Prophet Muhammad (SAWW) and Their Return to DisbeliefAbstract:This paper examines the controversial theological question concerning the conduct of some companions (Sahabah) of Prophet Muhammad (SAWW) following his death, and the claim—rooted in both Sunni and Shia narrations—that certain companions deviated from the Prophet’s teachings, committing acts tantamount to disbelief (kufr). Drawing primarily fromSahih al-Bukhariand Shia interpretations, this analysis seeks to address whether the companions of the Prophet remained steadfast in faith or whether some fell into moral and spiritual corruption after his demise.1. IntroductionAmong various Islamic schools of thought, particularly within Sunni and Shia Islam, there exists a profound theological divergence regarding the sanctity and moral infallibility of the Prophet’s companions. While Sunni traditions generally uphold that all companions (Sahabah) were righteous and praiseworthy, the ShiaIthna'ashari(Twelver Shia) perspective challenges this notion by asserting that not all companions maintained their faith and integrity after the Prophet’s death.This issue is not merely historical—it touches on the very question of authority, legitimacy, and moral integrity in early Islamic leadership. The Shia tradition, for instance, maintains that certain companions engaged in acts of disobedience and injustice so grave that they effectively returned to disbelief (kufr), betraying the message of Islam and the Prophet’s household (Ahl al-Bayt).2. Sunni Narratives inSahih al-BukhariA key point of reference in this debate is a narration found inSahih al-Bukhari, widely regarded by Sunni scholars as the most authentic collection of Hadith after the Qur’an. According to the narration reported byAbu Huraira, the Prophet Muhammad (SAWW) described a future event involving his companions on the Day of Judgment at thePond of Kawthar.Abu Huraira narrated that:“A group of my companions will come to me at the Pond (of Kawthar), and they will be driven away by the angels. I will say: ‘They are my companions!’ But it will be said: ‘You do not know what they innovated after you.’ Then I will say: ‘Away with those who changed (the religion) after me!’”(Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 8, Hadith 584)This narration implies that certain individuals who were once close companions of the Prophet will bedenied access to Paradisedue to their posthumous deviations from his teachings. It thus raises significant theological questions about the presumption of universal righteousness among the companions.3. Theological Implications and Shia InterpretationFrom the ShiaIthna'ashariperspective, this narration corroborates their position that some companions, despite being close to the Prophet, later committed acts ofapostasy(irtidad) orgrave injustice, particularly in matters of political succession and treatment of the Prophet’s family.Shia scholars argue that the Prophet’s warning at the Pond of Kawthar symbolizes divine disapproval of those companions who distorted his message, oppressed theAhl al-Bayt, or usurped leadership unjustly.According to this view, prominent figures such asAbu Bakr, Umar ibn al-Khattab, Uthman ibn Affan, Mu‘awiyah ibn Abi Sufyan, and Khalid ibn al-Walidare among those accused of having deviated from the Prophet’s intended path. Shia theologians maintain that their political and military actions after the Prophet’s death constituted rebellion against divine will and betrayal of the Prophet’s legacy.4. Sunni CounterargumentsSunni scholars, on the other hand, interpret this hadith differently. They argue that the narration does not refer to thecore companions(Sahabah al-Kibar) who faithfully transmitted Islam, but rather tolater followers(munafiqeenor hypocrites) who pretended to be companions while secretly opposing the Prophet.Furthermore, Sunnis emphasize that the Prophet (SAWW) declared in another hadith,“The best of my nation is my generation, then those that follow them,”(Bukhari, Muslim). This statement is often cited as evidence of the overall integrity and virtue of the Prophet’s companions, despite possible individual transgressions.5. The Abu Huraira ControversyThe narration’s transmitter,Abu Huraira, has also been a point of contention. Critics from the Shia tradition question his reliability, accusing him of fabricating or misinterpreting narrations that diminish the status of theAhl al-Bayt. The Shia argument presented in the text challenges Sunni consistency:If Abu Huraira’s hadith portrays some companions as apostates, does that mean he has “insulted” the companions—an act for which Shia Muslims are often condemned? If so, why is he not likewise accused of blasphemy (takfir) or deceit?This rhetorical question underscores the perceived inconsistency in Sunni defense of the companions while accepting hadiths that appear to condemn them.6. ConclusionThe question of whether some companions of Prophet Muhammad (SAWW) fell into disbelief or moral corruption remains one of the most contentious theological issues between Sunni and Shia Islam. While Sunni traditions maintain the general uprightness of all companions, Shia theology insists that righteousness must be measured by faithfulness to the Prophet’s teachings and loyalty to his purified household (Ahl al-Bayt).The narration of thePond of Kawtharcontinues to serve as a critical scriptural point in this discourse, highlighting the possibility that proximity to the Prophet did not necessarily guarantee enduring faith or obedience.Ultimately, this debate reveals the deep complexities within Islamic historiography and theology—where questions of faith, leadership, and moral integrity intersect with the very foundations of Islamic identity.By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteAcademic Analysis on Early Islamic Apostasy and the Companions of the Prophet (SAWW)",

If he dies or is slain, will you then turn back on your heels?”The Fulfillment of the Prophecy After the Prophet’s DeathThe words of Allah and His noble Messenger began to manifest immediately after the Prophet’s death. It had scarcely been a moment after his passing when a man—identified as ʿUmar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb—emerged from the Prophet’s house with his sword unsheathed and proclaimed before the gathered people:“Let no one dare say that Muhammad is dead!”ʿUmar’s resistance to acknowledging the Prophet’s death revealed an inner motive—a denial and emotional rebellion that the Qur’an had forewarned: “Will you turn back on your heels?”Later, ʿUmar summoned his close companion Abū Bakr, who was at that time outside Madinah with his wife. When Abū Bakr arrived, he entered the Prophet’s house, confirmed his death, and then came out to address the people, saying:“Indeed, Muhammad was but a Messenger; Messengers have passed away before him. Now Muhammad has died.”Following this declaration, Abū Bakr and ʿUmar hastened toSaqīfah, where they became involved in a heated dispute with theAnṣār(the Helpers) over the issue of succession. Abū Bakr was eventually chosen as Caliph after threats, pressure, and promises of wealth were made to secure allegiance.This political struggle marked the beginning of what the Qur’an described as “turning back on their heels.”Following the Path of Those Who Came BeforeThe subsequent actions of Abū Bakr, ʿUmar, and their supporters mirrored the Prophet’s warning that his community would imitate the previous nations “step by step and cubit by cubit.” Just as the earlier communities had deviated from divine truth, certain Companions also diverged from the Prophet’s teachings immediately after his death.Today, we witness many Muslims who pride themselves on being “pure believers” yet follow in the footsteps of those early figures, Abū Bakr and ʿUmar—figuratively entering the “lizard’s hole” that the Prophet described.They frequently invoke terms such asbidʿah(innovation), claiming that the Prophet did not perform certain acts, while insisting that revering and blessing Abū Bakr and ʿUmar is obligatory, equivalent to the pillars of prayer and fasting.Some even go so far as to utter blasphemous statements about the Prophet himself—such as ʿUmar’s alleged remark that “the Prophet is delirious”—a statement that deeply contradicts the honor and infallibility accorded to him by Islam.ConclusionThis narration, as cited fromSahih al-Bukhariand correlated with Qur’an 3:144, has been interpreted by some scholars as a prophetic forewarning: that after his death, certain followers would deviate from the true path of Islam and adopt practices or ideologies resembling those of past religious communities.Such interpretations continue to inspire theological debates concerning the succession crisis, the legitimacy of early caliphs, and the fulfillment of the Prophet’s words regarding imitation of previous nations.",

    "full_content": "DOES RAIN REMOVE THE POLLUTION OF SATAN FROM MUSLIMS?By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute – January 14, 2022AbstractThis paper critically examines the Qur’anic verseSurah Al-Anfal (8:11)which suggests that rain sent by Allah purifies believers from the pollution of Satan. The inquiry questions the theological coherence of associating natural rainfall with spiritual purification and evaluates the implications of such claims from a doctrinal and logical perspective.IntroductionThe Qur’an, in several verses, attributes natural phenomena such as rain to divine acts of mercy and purification. However, SurahAl-Anfal 8:11presents an unusual theological claim that rain removes the \"pollution of Satan\" (rijz al-shayṭān) from believers. This verse raises questions regarding the metaphysical nature of Satan’s impurity and whether physical water can effect spiritual cleansing.The Qur’anic Text and TranslationThe verse in question reads:Arabic Text (Qur’an 8:11):إِذۡ یُغَشِّیكُمُ ٱلنُّعَاسَ أَمَنَةࣰ مِّنۡهُ وَیُنَزِّلُ عَلَیۡكُم مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَاۤءِ مَاۤءࣰ لِّیُطَهِّرَكُم بِهِۦ وَیُذۡهِبَ عَنكُمۡ رِجۡزَ ٱلشَّیۡطَـٰنِ وَلِیَرۡبِطَ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِكُمۡ وَیُثَبِّتَ بِهِ ٱلۡأَقۡدَامَEnglish Translation (Abdul Haleem):“Remember when He gave you sleep as a reassurance from Him, and sent down water from the sky to cleanse you, to remove Satan’s pollution from you, to make your hearts strong, and your feet firm.” (Al-Anfal 8:11)Theological AnalysisThe verse attributes to rain not only physical purification but also spiritual deliverance from the “pollution of Satan.” The key termrijz al-shayṭān(“filth” or “pollution of Satan”) is metaphorically ambiguous. Classical commentators such asIbn KathirandAl-Jalalaynhave attempted to interpret this expression as referring to spiritual impurity or fear instilled by Satan. However, the literal reading of the text, which links rainwater to the removal of Satanic impurity, presents significant theological inconsistencies.If rain literally removes “the pollution of Satan,” then one must ask:What is the nature of this pollution?Is it physical, moral, or spiritual?How can a physical element (rain) remove a metaphysical impurity (Satanic corruption)?What are the implications for regions with little or no rainfall, such as the Arabian Desert?Does the absence of rain imply continued pollution by Satan?Contextual and Logical ImplicationsFrom a logical standpoint, such a claim conflates natural processes with supernatural deliverance. While rain indeed has physical cleansing properties, the assertion that it removes the defilement of Satan introduces a metaphysical contradiction. This raises an ironic theological concern for Muslim regions such as Saudi Arabia, where rain is rare and the environment is predominantly arid.If the Qur’anic verse is to be understood literally, Muslims living in desert regions would, by implication, remain “uncleansed” from the pollution of Satan due to the scarcity of rainfall. This leads to a theological absurdity — linking one’s spiritual purity to the frequency of rain in a geographical location.ConclusionThe Qur’anic claim inAl-Anfal 8:11that rain removes “the pollution of Satan” reflects an anthropomorphic understanding of spiritual purification. Unlike the Christian theological framework, where cleansing from sin is through the blood of Christ (1 John 1:7) and the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit, the Qur’anic concept seems to externalize spiritual cleansing through natural phenomena.Such a concept diminishes the transcendence of spiritual renewal and instead anchors it in material elements. This analysis underscores the need for critical examination of theological claims within Islamic scripture and their implications for doctrinal coherence.BibliographyThe Qur’an, SurahAl-Anfal (8:11).Abdul Haleem, M.

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteWednesday, January 12, 2022Introduction: The Claim ExaminedMuslim apologists frequently argue that the Bible prophesies or references the city of Mecca, asserting that “Baca” in Psalm 84:6 is a cryptic mention of Mecca, called “Bakkah” in the Qur’an (Surah 3:96). At first glance, the similarity in the two names seems striking—but a careful, honest reading of the biblical and Qur’anic texts exposes this as amisguided and unsustainable claim.The Biblical Context of “Baca”Let us look directly at the relevant passage:“Blessed are those whose strength is in you,who have set their hearts on pilgrimage.As they pass through the Valley of Baca,they make it a place of springs;the autumn rains also cover it with pools.”(Psalm 84:5-6, NIV)This passage describes pilgrims journeying to thesanctuary of the Lord—a context steeped in Jerusalem Temple worship, not an Arabian setting. The entire psalm radiates a longing for thedwelling place of Yahweh, repeatedly referencing “your house,” “your altar,” and “Zion” (Jerusalem), not Mecca or the Ka‘bah.Contradictory DetailsLet us weigh the evidence:God’s Dwelling Place:The sanctuary in Psalm 84 is where God’s presence is said to dwell (v.1, v.4). Nowhere in Islamic doctrine is Allah believed to literally “dwell” in the Ka‘bah; this concept is utterly foreign to Islamic theology, which strictly rejects all forms of anthropomorphism. By contrast, the Old Testament consistently presents the Temple in Jerusalem as the locus of God’s special presence among His people (1 Kings 8:10-13, 27).The Altar:Psalm 84 mentions drawing near to the altar (v.3). There is no altar in Mecca’s Ka‘bah as part of any sacrificial system, but the altar is central to both tabernacle and temple worship in ancient Israel (Exodus 27:1-8). The Qur’an never describes Bakkah as a place of sacrifice or an altar to Yahweh.Inhabitants and Roles:The psalmist blesses those who “dwell in your house” (v.4)—a reference to the priests and Levites residing within the temple precincts. The Ka‘bah is empty, uninhabited, and guarded, not lived in or managed by priests with biblical duties. There were doorkeepers for the Temple (2 Kings 25:18); no such official role exists for the Ka‘bah in Islamic tradition.Destination: Zion, Not Mecca:The pilgrimage in Psalm 84 has a clear destination:Zion, one of Jerusalem’s hills and a synonym for the city itself (v.7). It is geographically, historically, and theologically nonsensical to suggest the pilgrims of Israel would make a detour through Arabia on their way to Jerusalem!Hebrew vs. Arabic Terms:While Hebrew “Baca” (בכא) and Arabic “Bakkah” (بكة) sound similar, this is a superficial connection. The root of “Baca” is linked to weeping (“the Valley of Weeping”) or to balsam trees common to dry places, not to a specific city. The word for “pilgrimage” in Psalm 84:5 is not “hag” (Hebrew חג), related to festival, but from a root meaning “highway” or “path,” simply denoting the journey to Jerusalem.The Valley of Baca: Real or Figurative?Whether Baca refers to a literal valley near Jerusalem or is a poetic expression for hardship and sorrow, its purpose is clear:it marks a stage on the route to Jerusalem.Some Jewish sources place it north of the city. Nowhere in the Bible is there any implication that Baca is remotely connected with Mecca, which is over 1,000 kilometers to the south and across the Sinai wilderness. Nor does the biblical narrative allow for such an implausible detour.The Error of Superficial SimilarityThe attempt to equate “Baca” with “Bakkah” relies only on a similarity of sound, not on substantive historical, geographical, or theological data. Many locations in the Ancient Near East bear similar names (e.g., Wadi al-Baka in Sinai, a valley called Baca in Galilee), yet no one claims these are Mecca.Why the Confusion?The primary reason for such claims is the effort toretrofit Islamic revelation into biblical prophecy—a recurring theme among some Islamic polemicists. The motive is clear: if Islam can claim biblical roots, its status as a true continuation of Abrahamic faith is bolstered. But this effort here iscontradicted by the biblical evidence itself.Conclusion: The Claims Do Not StandA close, honest reading shows thatBaca of the Bible is not the Bakkah of the Qur’an. The biblical psalm speaks of Israelite pilgrims journeying to Jerusalem’s Temple, not of any pre-Islamic sanctuary in Arabia. Attempts to conflate the two areunsupported by scripture, history, or theology.In fact, such efforts demonstrate the dangers of forcing a text to fit a predetermined theory, rather than letting the text speak on its own terms.Let fair-minded seekers of truth see this as a cautionary example. The Christian and Jewish scriptures do not mention or anticipate Mecca as a place of pilgrimage—neither in Psalm 84 nor anywhere else.Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

This peculiar sign is explicitly recorded in one of the authentic Hadith collections.Hadith of Abu Huraira (may Allah be pleased with him):The Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) said:\"The Hour will not be established until the buttocks of the women of the tribe of Daus move while going around Dhi-al-Khalasa.\"Explanation:Dhi-al-Khalasawas an idol that the Daus tribe used to worship during the pre-Islamic period of ignorance (Jahiliyya). This idol was a central object of idolatrous rituals, and it is noted in the Hadith that one of the signs preceding the establishment of the Last Day (Qiyamah) would be the women of this tribe moving their buttocks around this very idol.Source:Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 9, Book 88, Hadith Number 232.Arabic Text of the Hadith:حديث أبي هريرة رضي الله عنه أن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم قال:\"لن تقوم الساعة حتى تضطرب أليات نساء دوس حول ذي الخلصة\"Translation of the Arabic Text:Narrated Abu Huraira (may Allah be pleased with him): The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said:\"The Hour will not be established until the buttocks of the women of the tribe of Daus move while going around Dhi-al-Khalasa.\"Reference:Sahih Bukhari — Volume 9, Book 88, Hadith 232Concluding Note:This narration reflects one of the unusual eschatological signs described in early Islamic literature concerning the Day of Judgment. The mention of such an occurrence reveals the cultural and religious context of 7th-century Arabia, where certain pre-Islamic idols and tribal practices remained significant symbols even in prophetic warnings. From a comparative theological perspective, it underscores the unique character of some Islamic eschatological traditions when juxtaposed with those of other Abrahamic faiths.Shalom,Max Shimba Ministries Org",

    "full_content": "A Critical and Scholarly Examination of a Major Qur’anic ContradictionBy Dr. Max Shimba | Max Shimba MinistriesIntroductionThursday, December 2, 2021This article presents a scholarly examination of a theological and historical issue arising in the Qur'an—namely, the claim that there was a flood during the time of Prophet Moses. According to the Bible, there was no such event recorded as part of the ten plagues in Egypt. This analysis draws upon Qur’anic verses, classical tafsir (commentaries), and the biblical record to highlight a contradiction that carries theological significance.1.Flood in the Days of NoahThe Qur’an clearly attributes a global flood to the time of Prophet Noah, as seen in the following verses:“Indeed, We sent Noah to his people, and he dwelt among them for a thousand years minus fifty. Then the flood overtook them while they were wrongdoers.” (Surah 29:14, Arberry)“But they denied him, so We saved him and those with him in the Ark, and We drowned those who rejected Our signs. Indeed, they were blind people.” (Surah 7:64, Arberry)“So they denied him, and We saved him and those with him in the Ark, and made them successors, and drowned those who denied Our signs. So see what was the end of those who were warned.” (Surah 10:73, Arberry)These verses unmistakably affirm the flood during Noah’s time.2.Alleged Flood During the Time of MosesHowever, the Qur’an appears to suggest that another flood occurred during Moses' confrontation with Pharaoh:“So We sent upon them the flood, the locusts, the lice, the frogs, and the blood as clear signs, but they were arrogant and were a criminal people…” (Surah 7:133, Arberry)“So We took retribution from them and drowned them in the sea because they denied Our signs and were heedless of them.” (Surah 7:136, Arberry)“And We brought the Children of Israel across the sea, and Pharaoh and his hosts followed them in arrogance and enmity, until drowning overtook him…” (Surah 10:90–92, Arberry; cf. Yusuf Ali version)The Yusuf Ali translation emphasizes Pharaoh dying in a “flood,” implying more than just a parting of the Red Sea. This interpretation creates confusion when read alongside biblical accounts.3.Contradiction with the Biblical RecordThe Bible, in the Book of Exodus, documents ten distinct plagues sent by God upon Egypt for Pharaoh's refusal to release the Israelites. These are:Water turned to blood (Ex. 7:20)Frogs (Ex. 8:6)Lice (Ex. 8:17)Swarms of flies (Ex. 8:24)Death of livestock (Ex. 9:6)Boils (Ex. 9:10)Hailstorm (Ex. 9:23)Locusts (Ex. 10:14)Darkness (Ex. 10:22)Death of the firstborn (Ex. 12:29)Nowhere is a “flood” mentioned as one of the ten plagues. The drowning of Pharaoh and his army occurs at the Red Sea during the Exodus but not as a flood judgment over the land of Egypt.4.Qur’anic Exegetical Evidence: Classical TafsirClassical Islamic commentators confirm the presence of a flood in the story of Moses:Ibn Kathir on Surah 7:133:“Ibn Abbas said it was heavy rain that destroyed the crops and fruits... Mujahid said it refers to water that carried plague and death across the land... The land was covered with water, so they begged Moses to pray for them...”Al-Tabari:“Then Allah sent the flood upon them... Everything they had was submerged...”Ibn Ishaq (through Ibn Humayd and Salamah):“Allah sent him with signs... He sent the flood, then locusts, then vermin, then frogs, and finally blood... The flood submerged the land’s surface, then withdrew...”Ibn Abbas (Tanwîr al-Miqbâs):“(We sent upon them) unceasing rain from Saturday to Saturday...”Al-Jalalayn:“We sent upon them a flood of water that entered their homes and reached their necks for seven days...”This extensive traditional evidence affirms that the Qur’anic commentators understood “Tufan” (flood) to mean literal flooding during Moses’ time.5.A Further Inconsistency: Nine Signs Instead of TenThe Qur’an also claims that Moses was sent withninesigns:“And We gave Moses nine clear signs. Ask the Children of Israel when he came to them...” (Surah 17:101, Arberry)This contradicts the well-documented ten plagues in the Torah. Even Qur’anic exegesis attempts to reconcile this by listing the signs:Ibn Abbas (Tafsir on 17:101):“The hand, the staff, the flood, locusts, lice, frogs, blood, years of famine, and loss of wealth.”Al-Jalalayn:“The hand, the staff, the flood, locusts, lice, frogs, blood, loss of wealth, and years of scarcity...”The omission of the death of the firstborn—arguably the most severe of the plagues—is noteworthy and further highlights the inconsistency.6.ConclusionThe Qur'an presents an anachronistic and historically inaccurate claim that a flood occurred in Egypt during the time of Moses as one of the plagues. This is at odds with both the Biblical record and historical understanding. The confusion likely stems from a conflation of the Noahic flood and the Exodus narrative.As noted by Christian apologist Abdallah Abd al-Fadi:“There was no flood in Egypt during the Exodus. This confusion is likely due to a misplacement of the global flood of Noah into Moses' timeline.”(Does the Qur'an Have Errors?Nuru ya Maisha, p. 88–89)Thus, this is yet another example where the Qur'an appears to contradict previous divine revelations and historically accurate accounts.Shalom,Dr. Max ShimbaMax Shimba Ministries",

    "full_content": "Tuesday, November 30, 2021The Twenty Versions of the Qur'an: A Critical ExaminationBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteMax Shimba Ministries Org.IntroductionIn this study, I intend to present factual evidence regarding the existence of multiple versions of the Qur'an, a topic that has long been suppressed within Islamic circles. Contrary to the widely held belief that there exists only one Qur'an, historical sources and Islamic hadith literature record the existence oftwenty different versionsof the Qur'an. Among these, seven have been explicitly acknowledged in the most trusted hadith collections attributed to the Prophet Muhammad.This paper will outline the twenty known versions, their respective transmitters (Qurrā’), and raise critical theological and historical questions that challenge the claims of a singular, unchanged Qur'anic text.The Seven Primary Qur’anic Readers (Qurrā’) and Their VersionsIslamic tradition acknowledges seven principal Qur'anic readers, each of whom is said to have transmitted the Qur'an with two distinct narrations (versions). These readings, orQirā’āt, have been historically accepted as authoritative, though variations exist among them in pronunciation, word choices, and occasionally meaning.The seven primary readers and their two versions each are as follows:Nāfiʿ(from Medina; d. 169 AH / 785 CE)WarshQālūnIbn Kathīr(from Mecca; d. 119 AH / 737 CE)Al-BazziQunbulAbū ʿAmr al-ʿAlāʾ(from Damascus; d. 154 AH / 770 CE)Al-DūrīAl-SūrīIbn ʿĀmir(from Basra; d. 118 AH / 736 CE)HishāmIbn DhakwānḤamzah(from Kufah; d. 156 AH / 772 CE)KhalafKhallādAl-Kisā’ī(from Kufah; d. 189 AH / 804 CE)Al-DūrīAbū’l-ḤārithAbū Bakr ʿĀṣim(from Kufah; d. 158 AH / 778 CE)ḤafṣIbn ʿAyyāshThe Additional Three Readers and Their NarrationsIn addition to the seven primary readers, Islamic scholars recognizethree supplementary readers, each transmitting two additional versions:Abū JaʿfarIbn WardānIbn JamāzYaʿqūb al-ḤāshimīRuwaysRawḥKhalaf al-BazzārIsḥāqIdrīs al-ḤaddādThough Islamic authorities affirm these as authentic, it is evident that there are at leasttwenty versionsof the Qur'an preserved through oral transmission, each with its distinct variations.Critical Questions for Theological ReflectionThe existence of these multiple readings and narrations raises several important theological and historical questions that remain largely unaddressed in contemporary Islamic discourse:Among these many Qur’anic readers, whose version is truly authoritative and correct?If Allah revealed the Qur'an to Muhammad, why are there numerous readers with differing versions, while the Prophet himself is not cited as a transmitter of any specific reading among these twenty?If Allah revealed the Qur'an to Muhammad alone, how did other individuals come to possess different versions of the same divine revelation?How can such variations be justified if the Qur'an is claimed to be a singular, unaltered, and perfect book in the Arabic language?If the Qur'an exists in only one Arabic form as frequently claimed, how can it be recited in twenty different forms within the same language?Do these discrepancies not contradict the assertion of a perfectly preserved revelation?Among these twenty versions of the Qur'an, which one is the original, authentic, and true version?By what criteria do Islamic scholars or believers determine the authenticity of one version over another?Which version did Prophet Muhammad himself recite and memorize?Is there evidence to confirm the exact version he followed, given that Islamic tradition ascribes the preservation of the Qur'an primarily to his personal recitation?ConclusionThis investigation highlights a critical issue within Islamic textual history—the presence of multiple accepted Qur'anic versions transmitted by various readers, each with distinct narrations. While Muslim scholars have attempted to explain these variations as acceptable within the tradition ofQirā’āt, this diversity raises serious theological implications for the claim of a single, unchanged Qur'an.It is evident that Islam harbors numerous concealed complexities, and the refusal to openly address them continues to obscure the religion's historical development. The acknowledgment of twenty Qur'anic versions is, therefore, not merely a scholarly observation but a profound theological dilemma for the claims of Islamic orthodoxy.May God bless you and open your eyes to truth.In His service,Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteMax Shimba Ministries Org.",

    "full_content": "Title:The Qur'anic Cosmology of Stars as Weapons Against Demons: A Theological and Scientific CritiqueBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba | Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionOnThursday, November 25, 2021, I encountered a striking and troubling doctrinal claim within Islamic scripture — a claim that exposes a profound theological and scientific incongruity in the Qur'an’s cosmology. According to several verses in the Qur'an,stars were created by Allah not only for adornment in the sky but also as missiles to hurl at demons (jinn or shayatin)who attempt to eavesdrop on the heavenly assembly. This assertion raises serious questions about the Qur'an’s compatibility with both established scientific knowledge and sound theological reasoning.This article seeks to translate, examine, and expand upon these Qur'anic claims, highlighting their inconsistencies and providing a critical Christian theological response.Qur'anic Verses on Stars as MissilesSurah 67:5 (Al-Mulk)\"And We have certainly beautified the nearest heaven with lamps and have made them (as missiles) to drive away the devils and have prepared for them the punishment of the Blaze.\"Surah 37:6–8 (As-Saffat)\"Indeed, We have adorned the nearest heaven with an adornment of stars, and as protection against every rebellious devil, so they may not listen to the exalted assembly (of angels) and are pelted from every side.\"Additional references can be found in:Surah 15:16–18,Surah 55:33–35, among others.Theological and Scientific ImplicationsThe Qur'anic claim suggests thatstars function as physical weapons used by Allah to strike demons attempting to access the heavens. In this worldview:Stars serve not merely as astronomical bodies but as divine artillery.Thepurpose of these celestial objects includes both cosmic decoration and metaphysical warfare.However, this notion collapses under both theological scrutiny and modern scientific understanding.Scientific IncompatibilityFrom a scientific standpoint:Stars are massive luminous spheres of plasma held together by gravity, undergoing nuclear fusion reactions in their cores.The nearest star to Earth, the Sun, is approximately93 million miles (150 million kilometers) away.To suggest that stars could be thrown or used as missiles iscategorically absurdby any standard of astrophysics. The laws of thermodynamics, gravitational theory, and astronomical observation uniformly contradict this assertion.Moreover, if even a small celestial body like an asteroid could devastate a planet, the concept of weaponizing entire stars isludicrously unfeasible.This presents a significant problem for the Qur'an’s claim to divine origin since a true Creator would possess and communicate accurate knowledge of the universe He created.Theological InconsistencyFrom a Christian theological perspective:God is omniscient, omnipotent, and sovereign over both the natural and spiritual realms(Job 38:4-7; Psalm 8:3-4; Colossians 1:16-17).Nowhere in the Bible are stars depicted as literal missiles used against spiritual beings.Scripture presents thestars as signs, for seasons, and as declarations of God's glory (Genesis 1:14-18; Psalm 19:1).In fact, the Bible consistently differentiates between the material and the spiritual realms, and while angels and demons interact with the physical world (Job 1-2; Luke 8:30-33), such interactions arenot through physical projectiles hurled from astronomical bodies.The Qur'an's cosmology reflects anancient, pre-scientific, mythological worldviewakin to pre-Islamic Arab folklore, wherecelestial phenomena were attributed to deities and metaphysical conflicts.Spiritual Error and Pagan ContinuityThis doctrine alsomirrors animistic and polytheistic traditions, where heavenly bodies were believed to possess personalities or be active participants in spiritual warfare. The Qur'an, while claiming monotheism, here retainselements of mythic cosmology inconsistent with true monotheism.In Christian doctrine:Spiritual battles occur in the unseen realms (Ephesians 6:12).God's sovereignty is exercised through His Word, His angels, and His Spirit — not through throwing physical stars.Thus, the Qur'anic depiction not onlylacks theological coherence but undermines Islam's claim of preserving the pure monotheism of Abrahamic faith.ConclusionThe claim thatAllah uses stars as missiles against demonsis bothscientifically untenable and theologically flawed. It reveals aprimitive cosmological understanding embedded within the Qur'anthat fails bothmodern scientific scrutinyandBiblical theology.As Christian theologians and apologists, it is imperative to critically engage these claims and presentthe rational, coherent, and biblically grounded worldview of the living God — the Creator of heaven and earth, whose creation declares His glory and whose sovereignty extends over both the seen and unseen realms without resorting to mythical cosmologies.Shalom.Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

MalikBut what exactly are these seven Earths? Are they continents on this single planet? Are they other planets like Earth? Before evaluating the scientific credibility of this claim, we must define what is meant by \"seven Earths,\" especially as Muhammad and early Muslims understood them. The teachings about seven Earths are found in the early Islamic sources: Hadith and Qur'anic commentaries (Tafsir).1. Evidence from Hadith LiteratureSahih Al-BukhariNarrated by Abu Salama ibn 'Abd al-Rahman:The Prophet said, \"Anyone who wrongfully takes a span of land, his neck will be encircled with seven Earths on the Day of Resurrection.\"(Vol. 4, Book 54, Hadith 417; see also 418, 420; Vol. 3, Book 43, Hadiths 632-634)Narrated by Abdullah:A Jewish rabbi told Muhammad that Allah would place the heavens, Earth, trees, and creation on different fingers. The Prophet confirmed it by smiling and reciting Surah 39:67.Sahih MuslimAbu Salama had a dispute over land and went to Aisha. She responded by citing the Prophet:\"Anyone who seizes even a hand-span of land unjustly will have seven layers of Earth wrapped around his neck.\"(Book 10, Hadith 3925)Al-TirmidhiAbu Hurayrah narrated a long hadith in which the Prophet described the seven heavens and seven Earths, each separated by a 500-year journey. He explained that even if a rope were dropped from the top, it would fall under the knowledge and authority of Allah.Ahmad and Al-TirmidhiThese Hadiths show Muhammad was not passively relaying common beliefs but was actively teaching a cosmic structure with seven heavens above and seven flat Earths below.2. Additional Islamic SourcesUbayy ibn Ka’b on Surah 7:172Ubayy reported that Allah made a covenant with the descendants of Adam and invoked the seven heavens and seven Earths as witnesses to that covenant.Abu Sa’id al-KhudriThe Prophet said that if the phrase“There is no god but Allah”were placed on one side of the scale, and the seven heavens and seven Earths on the other, the phrase would outweigh them.Ya’la ibn MurrahThe Prophet said that if someone wrongfully took land, Allah would dig him down through the seven Earths and bind them around his neck on the Day of Judgment.3. Legal and Devotional TextsFiqh-us-SunnahReports include prayers invoking \"Lord of the seven heavens and all they shade, Lord of the seven Earths and all they carry.\"The Prophet taught supplications where believers call on Allah as the \"Creator of the heavens and Earths\" to seek protection.4. Early Muslim Historians and CommentatorsIbn Abbas (Tafsir)Interpreted Surah 65:12 as affirming seven layered flat Earths, like domes or levels.Al-TabariDescribed the cosmos as layered: heavens and Earth within a cosmic structure (haykal) resembling tent cords surrounding land and sea, with Earth as seven flat islands.Ibn KathirAffirmed the literal understanding of seven flat Earths and rejected metaphorical interpretations such as seven continents.Al-Kisa’iDescribed each of the seven Earths by name and their inhabitants:Ramaka:barren wind and punished nation.Khalada:torture tools and self-cannibalizing nation.Arqa:deadly quilled birds and corrupt people.Haraba:massive snakes and bat-like creatures.Malthamu:stones of sulfur hanging on unbelievers.Sijjin:hellish records and bird-like people.Ajiba:home of Iblis and a black dwarf nation called Khasum.Sheikh Al-AlbaniA modern scholar who supported the existence of seven Earths based on Qur’an and Hadith, criticizing those who reject it under Western scientific influence. He referred to Qur’anic verse:\"It is Allah who created seven heavens and the Earth the like thereof.\" (65:12)Analysis and Scientific ConflictThe evidence from early Islamic sources shows that Muhammad and his companions believed in literal seven Earths, flat and layered, not spherical planets or metaphorical meanings. These were not symbolic but part of their cosmological framework, derived from or parallel to ancient Near Eastern and Judaic cosmologies.From a modern scientific perspective, this belief contradicts astronomy, geology, and planetary science. There is no evidence of seven flat Earths beneath our world, each inhabited by distinct peoples or creatures. These ideas reflect ancient cosmology, not divine revelation.ConclusionGiven the overwhelming weight of early Islamic sources and interpretations, it is inescapable to conclude that:The Qur'an’s teaching of seven heavens and seven Earths is a reflection of pre-scientific cosmology.Muhammad himself believed and taught that the universe was structured in seven layers of heavens and Earths, with vast distances and fantastical creatures.This model is not only scientifically incorrect but is also presented as divinely revealed truth.Thus, this undermines the Qur'an’s claim to scientific or divine perfection and further challenges the prophetic authority of Muhammad.Therefore, the Qur'an’s description of the universe is rooted in ancient myth and cannot be reconciled with modern scientific understanding. This raises serious theological implications about the authenticity of the Qur'an and the prophethood of Muhammad.Shalom,Dr. Maxwell ShimbaFor Max Shimba Ministries",

When you present them with evidence, they ask, \"Show me the verse.\" There are actually many passages in the Bible that show the truth that Jesus is God. So many!Once you give them a verse, they change and say, \"I want the words that Jesus Himself spoke.\"This is a FALSE and unbiblical criterion. The truth is, the WHOLE Bible is the Word of God. It does not matter if it was spoken by Moses, Isaiah, John, Peter, or Jesus Himself. It is written:For prophecy never had its origin in the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit. (2 Peter 1:21)Therefore, their demand, “I want the words that Jesus Himself spoke,” is an invalid and illogical criterion.The following is biblical evidence that JESUS CHRIST is God.John 8:58Jesus said to them, \"Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I AM.\"\"I AM\" is a name belonging only to God. We find this name when Moses spoke with God and was sent to deliver the children of Israel from Egypt. It is written:Moses said to God, \"Suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ Then what shall I tell them?\" God said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM.” (Exodus 3:13-14)A human exists because God caused him to exist. A car exists because an engineer or designer caused it to be. A house exists because a builder made it. But God—HE JUST IS!! He does not exist because of anything or anyone else! That is why He said, \"I AM WHO I AM!\" Jesus is I AM. Therefore, He is God.John 10:30I and the Father are one.Muslims claim that Jesus and God are one only in purpose, not in their essence. So I ask them about the following passage from Isaiah, and they have no answer:Isaiah 9:6For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.This verse is very clear. The one spoken about is Jesus, and He is called \"Mighty God.\"John 14:9Jesus said to him, \"Have I been with you so long, and you still do not know me, Philip? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, ‘Show us the Father’?\"Jesus said these words after being asked a very clear question, aimed at knowing GOD THE FATHER! It is written:Philip said to Him, \"Lord, SHOW US THE FATHER, and it is enough for us.\"Then Jesus answered plainly: \"Whoever has seen me has seen the Father.\"This means, \"I am the Father Himself.\"Revelation 1:17 and Revelation 22:13I am the First and the LastI am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.Only God has the authority to be the first and the last; Jesus is the Alpha and Omega. Therefore, He is God.John 1:1In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the WORD WAS GOD.Muslims do not like this verse at all because it is very clear. Jesus is the Word; and the Word is God; therefore, Jesus is God!John 20:28Thomas answered Him, \"MY LORD AND MY GOD!\"When Thomas said this, the Lord Jesus did not deny it and say, \"I am not God.\" Instead, Jesus said to him,\"Because you have seen Me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.\" (John 20:29)Acts 20:28Keep watch over yourselves and all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers. Be shepherds of the church of GOD, WHICH HE BOUGHT WITH HIS OWN BLOOD.Which God has blood? The answer is clear. This is Jesus Christ. He is the one who gave His life and shed His blood on the cross; and this is when He established the Church.Colossians 1:16For IN HIM ALL THINGS WERE CREATED: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through Him and for Him.All things were created in Him, Jesus. It means that all things originated from Jesus; because Jesus is the Word of God. And we know that the Creator of all things is God; therefore, Jesus is the Creator—He is God!Colossians 2:9For IN CHRIST ALL THE FULLNESS OF THE DEITY LIVES in bodily form.We are all imperfect people. We fall again and again into sin. Therefore, no ordinary human can boast that he is as perfect as God. But in Jesus “ALL the fullness of God dwells.” Why? Because He is that very God.1 Timothy 3:16Beyond all question, the mystery of godliness is great: GOD WAS MANIFESTED IN THE FLESH, was vindicated by the Spirit, was seen by angels, was preached among the nations, was believed on in the world, was taken up in glory.Which God was manifested in the flesh? The answer is clear. It is Jesus Christ alone.Titus 2:13…while we wait for the blessed hope—the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior, JESUS CHRIST,Jesus Christ is the Great God!!The MAIN problem Muslims have is this: They judge God by human standards. God says:\"Behold, I am the Lord, the God of all mankind. Is anything too hard for me?\" (Jeremiah 32:27)The answer is obvious. THERE IS NOTHING!But you will find Muslims asking very strange questions. For example, if Jesus is God, when He died, who was watching over the world?This is a question fit to be asked about a creature. If we were speaking of a human being who had died, then it would make sense to ask, while he was dead who was taking care of his family? Because this is a question about human attributes, since a human cannot be in two or more places at once. GOD IS NOT A HUMAN! HE IS ABLE TO DO ALL THINGS—ESPECIALLY THE GOD OF ABRAHAM, ISAAC, AND JACOB!JESUS IS GOD FOREVER AND EVER!!HALLELUJAH!!ReflectAsk questionsTake action!Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

Then, they claim that Muhammad is the true prophet because he came for the entire world. The scripture they use to oppose Jesus’ prophethood to the world is what Jesus said when speaking with the Canaanite woman (that is, a non-Jew), who was asking Jesus to heal her daughter.It is written:He answered, “I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel.” (Matthew 15:26).God is a God of order and perfect timing. That’s why He didn’t create everyone at once. He started with just one person, and from that person, we all came. Similarly, He began by revealing Himself to just one nation in the entire world. From there, salvation spreads to all nations. It’s a clear fact that, except for Israel, all other peoples in the world originally worshiped other gods (that is, demons). Only Israel began with the true God.That’s why when the Lord Jesus spoke to the Samaritan woman at the well, He told her:\"You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews.\" (John 4:22).Salvation comes from the Jews because no other nation in the world knew the true God—all had pagan religions—whether white, African, Indian, Arab, etc. That is the truth.To say that Jesus did not come for all nations is the same as saying, because God only created Adam and Eve, then He is not the God of my family since He didn’t create me the same way He created Adam.One day, Jesus spoke to His disciples and told them:\"This is what is written: The Messiah will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day, and repentance for the forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.\" (Luke 24:46-47).Do you see that the Gospel was to begin at Jerusalem? And do you also see that He says all nations will be preached in His name? Are all nations only Israel?The Canaanite woman came at a time that was not yet her time. That was the time for preaching the Gospel to Israel first, then to the whole world.Below are further words from the Lord Jesus Himself confirming that He was sent to all nations worldwide and that He is the Messiah of God, anointed by the Holy Spirit to redeem the entire world.\"But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.\" (Acts 1:8).\"Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.\" (Matthew 28:19).\"For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.\" (John 3:17).\"If anyone hears my words but does not keep them, I do not judge that person. For I did not come to judge the world, but to save the world.\" (John 12:47).\"I lay down my life for the sheep. I have other sheep that are not of this sheepfold; I must bring them also. They too will listen to my voice, and there shall be one flock and one shepherd.\" (John 10:15-16).\"And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.\" (Matthew 24:14).Let me conclude by reiterating a few things I have said. God has always started something with just one person.He created one man, then we all came from him.He revealed Himself to one nation, then we all came to know Him.He began with one Son (Jesus), and then we are all born by faith in Him.Likewise, He brought salvation to one nation, Israel, and then it spreads everywhere—that’s why He tells the Samaritan woman at the well, “Salvation is from the Jews.” (John 4:22).This pattern of starting with one person or place is proof that all those who comfort themselves with sayings like “all religions are different paths that lead to God” are deceiving themselves and wasting their time and their eternal life! \"Salvation is from the Jews\"—that is, THROUGH JESUS ALONE!So, because the time for the spread of salvation had not yet come (since God moves according to His schedule and timing), that is why He told the Canaanite woman (a non-Jew) that He was sent only to Israel.But when the fullness of time came, that is, after He died and rose again, we see Him commissioning His apostles to go to the whole world.And the Bible clearly states:\"Therefore, remember that formerly you who are Gentiles by birth and called 'uncircumcised' by those who call themselves 'the circumcision' (which is done in the body by human hands)—remember that at that time you were separate from Christ, excluded from citizenship in Israel and foreigners to the covenants of the promise, without hope and without God in the world. But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near by the blood of Christ. For he himself is our peace, who has made the two groups one and has destroyed the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility, by setting aside in his flesh the law with its commands and regulations. His purpose was to create in himself one new humanity out of the two, thus making peace, and in one body to reconcile both of them to God through the cross, by which he put to death their hostility.\" (Ephesians 2:11-16).ReflectAsk questionsThinkTake actionDr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

If there is, then Muslims, please bring it forward so we can see it.Abu Huraira said, \"I heard the Prophet of Allah say, 'There is no creature that is not touched by Satan, and that is why a baby cries loudly at birth, because Satan has touched him, EXCEPT for Mary and her son Jesus; they were not touched by Satan.' Then Abu Huraira said: 'And I seek refuge with You for her and her offspring from Satan' (Qur'an 3:36).\"My brothers and sisters, today Muhammad himself has admitted that JESUS was never touched by Satan, but he (Muhammad) and all Muslims have been touched and manipulated by Satan.EVERY MUSLIM HAS A JINN IN HIS BODYJinns are allowed to reside in the body of any Muslim, so every Muslim has at least one Jinn and possibly more. Likewise, Jinns are allowed to live in the homes of Muslims. In any house of a believer of that faith, there is a Jinn or Jinns residing. It is an undeniable truth that without Jinns there is no Islam, just as without the Holy Spirit there is no Christianity. It is Jinns who took Prophet Muhammad for forty days in the valleys, where they instructed him regarding the establishment of that Islamic faith.NOW LET US READ ABOUT JESUS CHRISTJesus was born with the Spirit of God (Matthew 1:18)The Holy Spirit descended when He was baptized (Luke 3:22)Jesus was led by the Holy Spirit (Luke 4:1)Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Holy Spirit (Luke 4:14)Jesus said, “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me...” (Luke 4:18)Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit (Luke 10:21)The ministry of Jesus was led by the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:22)Anointed with the Holy Spirit (Acts 10:38)Offered Himself—died—by the Spirit (Hebrews 9:14)Returned to life by the Holy Spirit (1 Peter 3:18)UNCLEAN JINNS WORSHIP ALLAH AND MUHAMMADTherefore, according to what Allah says in the Qur’an: “I have created jinn and humans only to worship Me” (Qur’an 57:58; 51:56), and also in heaven the Jinn worship (the Jinn who converted to Islam in 620 AD)—read Qur’an 72:14—these are good Jinn who travel and inherit eternal life in the Hereafter (Hell). The primary goal of Satan and the Jinn is to befriend as many humans as possible so that, by their numbers, he will have many to take with him to HELL (Qur’an 6:128). The important thing to know here is that the eternal fire was not created for humans but for Satan and all his angels (the Jinn or demons). These have no further chance to confess or repent.Jesus Christ, whom Muslims acknowledge only as a Prophet, had no friendship or association with Satan or demons (Jinn). He commanded demons to leave those who were tormented by them (Matthew 8:29; Mark 5, etc.).When Jesus left this world, He was taken up by a cloud and ascended upwards to heaven. Heaven is above, as the Qur’an confirms. Jesus was able to ascend and enter Heaven, but Jinn (demons) who have converted to Islam, when they merely try to ascend, are met with burning fire. We have seen that the Jinn who are Muslims by conversion live in the Hereafter, that is, in Hell. So, do you think other Muslims will end up anywhere different for eternity? In Islamic faith, it is believed that when a Muslim dies, there are two Jinns who guard him in his grave.EVERY MUSLIM HAS A JINN IN HIS BODYJinns are allowed to reside in the body of any Muslim, so every Muslim has at least one Jinn and possibly more. Likewise, Jinns are allowed to live in the homes of Muslims. In any house of a believer of that faith, there is a Jinn or Jinns residing. It is an undeniable truth that without Jinns there is no Islam, just as without the Holy Spirit there is no Christianity. It is Jinns who took Prophet Muhammad for forty days in the valleys, where they instructed him regarding the establishment of that Islamic faith.MY ADVICE TO CHRISTIANS:My free advice to Christians is this: NEVER LEAVE CHRIST TO ENTER INTO THE FAITHS OF DEMONS (1 Timothy 4:1-2).Jinns or demons are the same thing; there is no difference between them. All these demons/Jinn opposed God and were cast down to earth. The Bible says there is no forgiveness for Jinns because they have already been judged and are only waiting to be thrown into Hell.Satan is still “the prince of the power of the air” (Ephesians 2:2). This means that Satan and the other fallen angels can influence our minds and thoughts through music, television, debates, etc. We are told to guard our thoughts and minds (2 Corinthians 10:3-5). 2 Corinthians 4:4 tells us that the god of this world has blinded the minds of unbelievers.Satan is behind all false religions and world religions. Satan will do everything in his power to oppose God and all who follow Him. Although Satan’s fate is sealed: the lake of fire forever (Revelation 20:10).God bless you all,Shalom,Dr. Maxwell Shimba, servant of Jesus Christ, the Almighty God",

First, let's read:17. Surah Al-Isra (Bani Israel)90. And they said: We will not believe you until you cause a spring to gush forth for us from the earth,91. Or you have a garden of date-palms and grapes, and cause rivers to gush forth in their midst in abundance,92. Or you cause the sky to fall upon us in pieces as you claimed, or bring Allah and the angels before [us] face to face,93. Or you have a house of gold, or you ascend into the sky. And [even then], we will not believe in your ascension until you bring down to us a book we may read. Say: Glory be to my Lord! Am I anything but a human messenger?(Qur’an, Surah 17:90-93)After being asked to perform at least one miracle, Muhammad failed miserably and did not perform a single miracle.Question:Why did Muhammad fail to perform miracles as he was asked to do?Muhammad is the only prophet who failed to perform miracles since the creation of the world. Is he worthy to be followed and believed?Why didn’t Allah help His prophet to perform a miracle?THE QURAN SAYS THAT A PROPHET MUST PERFORM MIRACLES;MUHAMMAD ADMITS HE IS A FALSE PROPHET AND DID NOT PERFORM MIRACLESThe Qur’an itself confirms that prophets and messengers must perform miracles.Qur’an 40:78, Surah Al-Mu’min [The Believer]“And indeed We sent messengers before you: among them there are those We have told you about, and some We have not told you about. And it was not for any messenger to bring a miracle except by Allah’s permission.”Muhammad never performed any miracle to prove his prophethood and messengership.Qur’an 29:50, Surah Al-Ankabut (The Spider).“And they say: ‘Why have not signs been sent down to him from his Lord?’ Say: ‘The signs are only with Allah, and I am only a clear warner.’”(See also Qur’an 6:35-37; 13:7)Muhammad admits that he never performed miracles. Therefore, according to their own Quran, Muhammad is a false prophet.Beyond that, Muhammad never made any prophecy. So how can there be a prophet without prophecy?One of the characteristics of a prophet is to give prophecy. Muhammad never gave any prophecy.Brothers and sisters,Muhammad was not a prophet of God and did not have the qualities of a PROPHET.Muhammad never spoke with the God who sent him.Muhammad had Satan with him since his birth.Muhammad confessed to being played by Satan during his calling in the cave.Muhammad confessed that Satan played with his mind and soul.Muhammad confessed that he was bewitched by Labiid bin Al’answan.SO MUSLIMS, SHOW ME—where in the Torah, Psalms, or Gospel there is a prophet with such strange characteristics as Muhammad.Come to Jesus, who is the only Way to Heaven.God bless you all.TRULY, MUHAMMAD WAS A FALSE PROPHETShalom,Dr. Maxwell Shimba, servant of Jesus Christ, the Most High God.

For example, they tell their believers that the dead intercede for us in heaven, or that by performing a mass on earth for a relative who died rejecting salvation, that person’s sins will be forgiven and God will admit them into heaven!The second thing that amazes me is how Islam and Muslims use lies so extensively to defend their religion and to keep their followers within it.If a religion cannot defend itself by the truth of its own message but must be upheld by lies—why defend it at all? And why believe in it?I do not wonder about those who are ignorant, but I am astonished at those who knowingly say, “Here, I must lie to defend Allah!” Meaning, they deliberately lie to protect a god who is supposedly all-powerful!Indeed, there are strange things in this world!Now, back to today’s topic. One of the great weapons of deception used by Muslims to promote their religion is the so-called“Gospel of Barnabas.”What is the Gospel of Barnabas?It is a large book (almost as long as all four Biblical Gospels combined, having 222 chapters). This book narrates the life of Jesus and claims to have been written by one of His apostles, Barnabas.The oldest known manuscripts of this book are only two—one in Italian and the other in Spanish. Both date from the15th or 16th century A.D.Why is the Gospel of Barnabas fake?When you read it, you immediately realize it is aforgery, for many reasons. Some are obvious; others require closer examination.Here are some of them:1.At the beginning of the gospel, Jesus is calledChrist:“Dearly beloved, the great and wonderful God hath during these past days visited us by his prophet Jesus Christ…”But later, Jesus denies being the Messiah:“Jesus confessed, and said the truth: ‘I am not the Messiah.’” (chapter 42)Yet the term “Christ” is the Greek translation of the Hebrew wordMessiah. Therefore,ChristandMessiahmean exactly the same thing.Since Jews had long awaited the Messiah, the writer’s confusion clearly shows he didn’t know Greek or Hebrew—languages Barnabas himself knew well. This proves the author of the Gospel of Barnabas wasnotthe biblical Barnabas.2.The Qur’an itself calls Jesus the Messiah (Surah 3:45). The Bible also calls Him the Messiah.So, if Muslims believe the Qur’an is true, why believe in the Gospel of Barnabas, which denies that Jesus is the Messiah, while rejecting the Bible, which agrees with the Qur’an?3.Chapter 3 of the Gospel of Barnabas claims thatHerod and Pilateruled Judea when Jesus was born.But historically,Herod the Greatruled between 37–4 B.C., andPontius Pilateruled from A.D. 26–36.That’s a difference of about 30 years!No one who lived in Jesus’ time could have made such a historical blunder.4.Chapter 20 says Jesus traveled by ship across the Sea of Galilee to Nazareth.But Nazareth is about14 kilometers inlandfrom the Sea of Galilee!No boat could possibly sail there.This reveals that the author knewnothingabout the geography of the Holy Land.5.The Bible (Leviticus 25:10–11) says the Year of Jubilee occurs every50 years.In A.D. 1300, Pope Boniface VIII mistakenly declared it should be celebrated every100 years.Later, in 1350, Pope Clement VI corrected it back to every 50 years.But in chapter 82, the Gospel of Barnabas quotes Jesus saying:“The year of jubilee, which now comes every hundred years…”How could Jesus, who lived in the 1st century, refer to an event that began inA.D. 1300?That’s like seeing a 1910 movie showing theTanzanian flag—something that didn’t exist until 1964.This is clear evidence that the Gospel of Barnabas was writtenafter A.D. 1300.6.Chapter 178 says there are nine heavens, and Paradise is above them all.This concept first appears in the writings ofDante Alighieri, the 14th-century Italian poet who wroteThe Divine Comedy.The Italian manuscript of the Gospel of Barnabas emerged around the same century—showing it was written during or after Dante’s time.7.In chapter 193, Jesus predicts He will die and rise again.But in chapters 216–217, the book claims God secretly took Jesus to heaven and transformed Judas’ face to look like Jesus, so Judas was crucified instead.This contradicts Jesus’ own supposed prophecy earlier in the same book!A self-refuting story.8.Chapter 54 says Pharisees existed during the prophet Elijah’s time.But history proves the Pharisees aroseseven centuries later(2nd century B.C.), while Elijah lived in the9th century B.C.Another impossible anachronism.9.Chapter 80 claims Daniel was taken to Babylon as a two-year-old.But according to the Bible (Daniel 2), Daniel interpreted Nebuchadnezzar’s dream and was made ruler over Babylon.Would athree-year-old childbecome governor? Absurd!10.Finally, Jesus never had an apostle namedBarnabas.The twelve apostles are listed in Matthew 10:2–4 and Luke 6:13–14.Barnabas appears only later in the Book of Acts (Acts 4:33–37) as a believer from Cyprus who joined the apostles after Jesus’ resurrection and ascension.Therefore,Barnabas was not one of the original apostles.After all this evidence (and much more not listed here), do you still believe the Gospel of Barnabas is authentic?Who really wrote it?If you have read it, what could possibly convince you otherwise, except that it was authored by aMuslimliving inItalybetween the 14th and 16th centuries, attempting to validate Muhammad—since the book openly praises him?As the Swahili proverb says:“He who has eyes needs no one to tell him to look,”and“A dead ear hears no medicine.”Are your eyes open—or is your ear dead?Heal yourself.How long will you be deceived?Reflect.Question things.Take action.© Max Shimba Ministries OrgMarch 18, 2019",

Generally, you will never encounter ajinnwith a Christian name—all of them have Islamic names. This, according to Desmon Mkumbo, one of the Bible service experts in Tanzania, shows something significant.Jinnsor evil spirits also preach Islam with great zeal and are even involved in converting people to Islam. When someone is sick or possessed by a spirit and taken to asheikhormaalim(Islamic healer) fordua(prayers), they are often given conditions such as changing their religion, name, or converting to Islam and performing Islamic prayers. These are instructions coming from thejinns. “Whoever has ears, let him hear!”Did Prophet Muhammad Use Witchcraft?Muhammad went to Jerusalem and reached the place where the Jewish Temple once stood—Muslims call itBaitul Maqdis.According to Islamic tradition, he traveled there in one night riding a creature calledBuraq.This creature is described as ajinnwith the face of a beautiful woman and the body of a horse (seeThe Life of Prophet Muhammad, p. 28, last paragraph).This story made many people in Mecca reject him, saying he was agreat sorcerer, and they refused to believe in a magician. These few hadiths show a strong connection between Islam andjinns,demons, witchcraft, or superstition. We will later analyze the Quranic view of these beings, includingdevils,angels, andjinns.The Prophet (peace be upon him) also taught a prayer to recite before entering the toilet. He said:“When one of you enters the toilet, he should say:‘Allahumma inni a‘udhu bika minal khubuthi wal khabaa’ith’(‘O Allah, I seek refuge in You from male and female devils.’)”Muhammad was thus teaching how to seek protection fromsorcerersorspiritswhen entering the toilet. But what is surprising is that Muslims appear to obey Satan in this act—asking forgiveness or protection frommale and female demonsthat, according to Islamic tradition, dwell in toilets!So, is Islam not a religion of Satan?Reflect on this.Biblical ContrastIn the Bible, when Jesus took on human form and came to earth, those samejinnsordemonsrecognized Him and cried out before Him.Matthew 8:28–31:“When He arrived at the other side in the region of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men came from the tombs to meet Him. They were so violent that no one could pass that way. ‘What do you want with us, Son of God?’ they shouted. ‘Have you come here to torture us before the appointed time?’”(See also Mark 5:1–9).Thejinnsknew that Jesus was the one who would judge them, yet they were surprised that He came before the time appointed for their judgment in the lake of fire.Jesus came to earth to save mankind from the torment of thesejinnsor demons. InRevelation 12:12, when the Archangel Michael cast down the rebellious angels (that is, thejinnsor demons), he said:“Woe to the earth and the sea…”This is why Jesus had to come to fight Satan, the Dragon, and the Devil on our behalf, for we could not defeat them ourselves. Thejinnsbegged Jesus, saying, “If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs.” Those about 2,000 pigs then rushed into the sea and drowned. The pigs preferred death to living with these evil spirits—thus fulfilling Michael’s message:“Woe to the earth and the sea.”The sea is one of the dwelling places ofjinns.Are Pigs Better Than Islam?(To be continued in Part Two.)Reflect.Ask questions.Take action.Jesus loves you.Max Shimba Ministries Org",

    "full_content": "An Inquiry into Early Lactation Accounts in Islamic Tradition: The Case of Prophet Muhammad and the Importance of Maternal Breast MilkBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaMax Shimba Ministries OrgPublished: May 20, 2018AbstractThis paper examines an intriguing claim from early Islamic hadith literature that narrates the Prophet Muhammad being breastfed by a male relative, Abu Talib, following his birth due to the absence of his mother’s milk. The discussion seeks to place this narrative within a critical textual, historical, and biological framework while highlighting the scientific importance of maternal breast milk in infant health and development. Utilizing modern medical research alongside primary Islamic texts, the paper evaluates both theological narratives and empirical health science perspectives to understand potential implications.IntroductionIslamic historical tradition, primarily documented in hadith literature, records various episodes from the early life of the Prophet Muhammad. One notable yet rarely discussed narration suggests that Muhammad was breastfed by his uncle, Abu Talib, through a miraculous provision of milk, reportedly sent by Allah, before being entrusted to a wet nurse named Halima al-Sa’diya.This account, while unusual by contemporary biological standards, raises both theological and scientific questions, especially when considering the established importance of maternal breast milk in early childhood development. This paper translates and academically analyzes the narration, explores its possible theological interpretations, and contrasts it with medical research on breastfeeding’s role in child growth and immunity.Primary Textual SourceThe primary reference comes from an Islamic hadith collection cited as:Sahih Hadith Al-Kaft Al-Kukaynir, Volume 1, Page 284, Hadith No. 27, which records:“When the Prophet Muhammad was born, he spent a long time without his mother’s milk. However, Abu Talib was blessed by Allah to produce milk through his breasts, which he fed to Muhammad for several days, until Halima al-Sa’diya was found and entrusted with the infant.”Though this hadith is not among the widely authenticated sahih collections (such as Sahih al-Bukhari or Sahih Muslim), it reflects certain narratives preserved in regional or less-canonized Islamic texts.The Role of Breast Milk in Early Child Development: A Biomedical PerspectiveThe World Health Organization (WHO) recommends exclusive breastfeeding for infants for the first six months of life. Maternal breast milk is universally recognized as the optimal source of nutrition for newborns, providing a unique balance of nutrients, immune factors, and bioactive compounds essential for the development and protection of infants (World Health Organization, 2024).Key Nutritional Components of Human Breast Milk:Proteins:0.8%–0.9%, primarily casein, alpha-lactalbumin, lactoferrin, secretory IgA, lysozyme, and serum albumin.Fats:Approximately 4.5%, rich in triglycerides (notably palmitic acid, oleic acid), essential fatty acids like linoleic acid, and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), which have anti-inflammatory and potential anticancer properties.Carbohydrates:Around 7.1%, predominantly lactose, alongside several human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) that protect against intestinal pathogens.Minerals:0.2%, including calcium, magnesium, and trace elements vital for growth.Significantly,secretory Immunoglobulin A (IgA)levels remain elevated in human milk from birth up to several months postpartum, providing mucosal immunity against pathogens.Moreover, breast milk containsalpha-lactalbumin, which in acidic stomach environments binds with oleic acid to formHAMLET (Human Alpha-lactalbumin Made Lethal to Tumor cells)— a complex shown to induce apoptosis in tumor cells, contributing to reduced cancer susceptibility in breastfed infants (Svensson et al., 2000).Religious and Theological ImplicationsThe narration of Prophet Muhammad’s wet nursing by Abu Talib introduces a significant theological and anthropological curiosity. Islam strictly prescribes milk kinship (rida’a), where children breastfed by the same woman become milk-siblings, affecting permissible marital relations. The report of a man lactating, even through divine provision, would be extraordinary in both pre-Islamic and Islamic Arabia, where male lactation is neither culturally normative nor biologically typical.Theologically, this narrative may have aimed to illustrate Allah’s miraculous provision for His Prophet. However, from a medical perspective,male galactorrhea— the spontaneous production of milk in males — is a documented but pathological condition associated with hormonal imbalances (e.g., elevated prolactin levels due to pituitary disorders).Scientific Infeasibility of Male BreastfeedingWhile rare,male lactationhas been reported in medical literature, typically in pathological or extreme hormonal circumstances (Jensen, 1992). The biological mechanism involves prolactin, a hormone primarily responsible for milk production in mammals. In normal male physiology, prolactin levels are insufficient for lactation.Cases of male lactation are medically classified and treated as endocrine disorders, not normative biological functions. Thus, the hadith’s claim, if taken literally, contradicts established biological science and would necessitate a supernatural intervention as posited by the narrative.ConclusionThe narration of the Prophet Muhammad being breastfed by Abu Talib is a remarkable theological tradition but scientifically implausible by modern endocrinology and pediatrics. The incident, if interpreted allegorically, underscores the protective providence of Allah over His Prophet. From a medical standpoint, the importance of maternal breast milk for optimal infant development is irreplaceable and universally affirmed by contemporary health authorities.While ancient narratives occasionally reflect cultural beliefs about miracles and divine provision, they must be critically assessed against established biomedical knowledge. The well-documented nutritional, immunological, and developmental benefits of maternal breastfeeding remain uncontested and continue to be a cornerstone of public health policy globally.ReferencesSvensson, M., et al.

    "full_content": "The Myth of the Two Seas Not Mixing in the Qur'an: A Scientific and Theological ResponseAuthor:Maxwell Shimba, Servant of Jesus Christ, the Great God (Titus 2:13)Date:May 16, 2018AbstractThis paper addresses the widely circulated claim among some Muslim apologists that the Qur’an contains a miraculous statement regarding the phenomenon of two bodies of water not mixing. By examining the Qur’anic passage in question alongside basic physical science — particularly concepts from physics such as density, salinity, and temperature — this study aims to demonstrate that the phenomenon is not a miracle but rather a well-understood natural occurrence. Furthermore, this article critiques the theological implications of attributing natural processes to divine miracles without scientific understanding.IntroductionAmong certain Islamic apologetic circles, there has persisted a claim that the Qur'an miraculously foretold a scientific phenomenon whereby two bodies of water meet but do not mix. This claim is often linked toSurah Al-Kahf (18:60-82), where it is mentioned:“And remember when Moses said to his servant: 'I will not give up until I reach the junction of the two seas or continue for a long period.'”(Qur'an 18:60)Many Muslim commentators have associated this verse with images showing the meeting of two distinct water bodies — typically a glacier-fed stream and a saltwater bay, claiming it as a miraculous confirmation of divine revelation. In this paper, we will scrutinize this claim using elementary physics and hydrology, demonstrating that this is not a miracle but a scientifically explainable event.Defining the Scientific ConceptsDensityIn physics,density(symbolized as ρ, the Greek letter rho) is a measure that compares the mass of a substance to its volume. The formula for density is:Density (ρ)=Mass (m)Volume (V)\\text{Density (ρ)} = \\frac{\\text{Mass (m)}}{\\text{Volume (V)}}Objects or substances with higher density have more matter packed into a given volume than those with lower density. The standard units for measuring density areg/cm³orkg/m³.For example, freshwater has a density of1.0 kg/L at 4°C, while seawater, due to its higher salt content, typically has a density of around1.025 kg/L.MassMass is a fundamental property of matter indicating the quantity of material present in a body. It is commonly measured inkilograms (kg).VolumeVolume refers to the three-dimensional space occupied by a substance or object. In physics, it is measured incubic meters (m³)orcubic centimeters (cm³).Salinity and Water ClassificationSeawaterSeawater is a solution containing dissolved salts, primarily sodium chloride (NaCl). On average, the world’s oceans have a salinity of3.5%, meaning there are approximately35 grams of dissolved salts per liter of seawater. This increases the density of seawater compared to freshwater.Salinity affects not only the density but also the freezing point of water. For example, seawater typically freezes at around-2°C (28°F)depending on salinity levels. Additionally, seawater’spH typically ranges from 7.5 to 8.4.FreshwaterFreshwater, such as that found in rivers, lakes, and rainfall, has significantly less dissolved salt, typically under0.1% salinity. Because of its lower salinity, freshwater has a lower density and different thermal properties compared to seawater.Scientific Explanation of the PhenomenonThe famous images often circulated by Islamic preachers — showing what appears to be two distinct water bodies refusing to mix — are typically photographs taken from theGulf of Alaska, whereglacial meltwatermeetsoffshore saltwater.The explanation for this occurrence is not miraculous but rather based on simple, observable scientific principles:Density Difference:Freshwater from melting glaciers is less dense than the saline seawater. This difference in density inhibits immediate mixing.Temperature Gradient:Both water bodies are extremely cold, which slows down the rate of diffusion and mixing.Salinity Difference:The stark contrast in salt content between glacial meltwater (very low salinity) and seawater (approximately 3.5% salinity) results in different physical properties, which delay mixing.Kinetic Energy:The process of mixing solutions, especially in liquids at low temperatures, takes longer because of reduced molecular motion.A useful analogyis dissolving sugar in water: sugar dissolves quickly in hot water due to high molecular movement but much slower in cold water. Similarly, cold freshwater and cold seawater mix slowly because of limited molecular interaction.Thus, what appears to be two water bodies not mixing is simply a gradual, natural mixing process dictated by physics, not a supernatural event.Clarifying MisconceptionsIt is important to clarify thatthis phenomenon does not involve two seasas the Qur'anic verse suggests. The images used by Muslims to illustrate this claim depict the confluence ofglacial freshwater and seawater, not the meeting of two seas.Furthermore,the notion of water bodies having permanent barriers between them contradicts oceanographic knowledge. All water bodies eventually mix over time, though the rate of mixing depends on temperature, salinity, and density.Theological ReflectionWhile Islamic apologetics often seeks to attribute unexplained natural phenomena to divine intervention, it is essential to distinguish between true miracles and scientifically explainable occurrences. Claiming natural events as miracles where science offers clear explanations reflects a lack of scientific understanding.From a Christian theological perspective,God is the Creator of the laws governing nature (Colossians 1:16-17). To attribute every unexplained event to miraculous intervention rather than understanding His creation through the lens of science diminishes the richness of both theology and natural philosophy.ConclusionThe claim that the Qur'an contains miraculous knowledge about two bodies of water not mixing is unfounded when examined scientifically. The observed phenomenon in places like the Gulf of Alaska is a natural result of differences in density, temperature, and salinity, and is well-explained by elementary physics and hydrology.This study reaffirms the importance of sound scientific understanding in interpreting natural events and cautions against attributing divine intervention to phenomena that are part of the natural order established by God.ReferencesMillero, F.

Allah’s love is entirely different from His deeds. That is why he sent a prophet whom he describes as insane, a man as inconsistent as his Allah.For example, inSurah Al-Hijr 15:6, the Qur'an records:\"And they say: ‘O you upon whom the Reminder has been sent down, indeed you are mad!’\"ALLAH, THE DESTROYER OF GENERATIONSIn several verses, the Qur'an shows that Allah takes pride in annihilating previous generations and punishing entire communities:Surah Al-An’am 6:5–6:\"But they have denied the truth when it came to them, so soon will come to them the news of what they used to mock at. Have they not seen how many generations We destroyed before them, whom We had established on the earth as We have not established you? And We sent the sky upon them in abundance, and made rivers flow beneath them; then We destroyed them for their sins and raised up after them another generation.\"Surah Al-A’raf 7:4:\"And how many towns have We destroyed! Our punishment came upon them by night or while they were sleeping at noon.\"Surah Yunus 10:13:\"And We certainly destroyed generations before you when they did wrong; and their messengers had come to them with clear proofs, but they would not believe. Thus do We recompense the criminal people.\"Surah Al-Hijr 15:4:\"And We did not destroy any city but that it had a known decree.\"IS THIS ATTRIBUTE OF DESTROYING AND KILLING PEOPLE THAT OF GOD OR OF SATAN?The Scriptures say this:John 10:7–15 (NKJV):Then Jesus said to them again, “Most assuredly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep. All who ever came before Me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them. I am the door. If anyone enters by Me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture.The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly.I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd gives His life for the sheep. But a hireling, he who is not the shepherd, one who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf catches the sheep and scatters them.The hireling flees because he is a hireling and does not care about the sheep. I am the good shepherd; and I know My sheep, and am known by My own. As the Father knows Me, even so I know the Father; and I lay down My life for the sheep.”The Son of God made it clear that Satan’s work has always been to steal, kill, and destroy. He has never changed — though he alters his names from time to time, today calling himself Allah. Ever since he was cast out of heaven, this has been his agenda on earth. And the Lord Jesus stated it plainly and without hesitation. The mission of the Lord Jesus is to give us life, and life in abundance.The enemy has always been a murderer, as evident in the way followers of Allah kill Christians in Islamic countries. Wherever he operates, there is destruction, jihad, and terrorism. At times, I find myself reflecting: what is wrong with humanity? Why do people befriend Satan and willingly become his slaves? When you choose to live in sin, you are essentially making an alliance with Satan for your life. And I assure you — you cannot avoid being robbed, killed, or devastated by Satan.Shalom,Dr. Max ShimbaA bondservant of Jesus Christ, our Great God and Savior.Titus 2:13",

While the Bible emphasizes the permanence of the marital bond, the Qur'an provides a structured procedure for initiating and finalizing divorce. This theological divergence raises fundamental questions regarding the nature of Allah in Islam. If Satan seeks to destroy families through separation and divorce, yet Allah explicitly legislates such acts in the Qur'an, then one must ask: What is the true nature and identity of Allah according to the moral framework of divine revelation? The paper evaluates this contrast and concludes with reflections on the biblical foundation of marital unity.IntroductionThe sanctity of marriage is foundational in Judeo-Christian theology. It is considered a divine institution, a covenant not only between two human beings but one joined and witnessed by God Himself. Conversely, Islamic theology, as expressed in the Qur’an and Hadith, accommodates and regulates the practice of divorce (talāq) as a permitted—even expected—reality of human life. This raises significant theological concerns, especially when compared with the biblical view that God hates divorce (Malachi 2:16). This article attempts to analyze the implications of this divergence and interrogate the moral and spiritual character of Allah as revealed in Islamic doctrine.The Meaning and Legal Understanding of DivorceDivorce, ortalakain Swahili (from the Arabictalāq), meansto separateorto sever ties. In legal terms, particularly in many modern judicial systems, it refers to a court-issued decree that formally dissolves a marital union. In many African contexts, informal street-level pronouncements of divorce—whether verbal or written—are not recognized under national law. Judicial divorce ensures that the rights and responsibilities of both parties are clarified, especially concerning property, custody, and spousal support.The Biblical View on Marriage and DivorceGod’s original intention for marriage is clear in Genesis 2:24, where it is written:“Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.”Jesus reaffirms this divine standard in Matthew 19:3-6, stating:“Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.”According to 1 Corinthians 7:39, a woman is bound to her husband as long as he lives, underscoring the covenantal and permanent nature of marriage.Moreover, inMalachi 2:15–16, Scripture clearly affirms:“For the Lord God of Israel says that He hates divorce.”Thus, from a biblical perspective, divorce is not merely discouraged—it is viewed as a violation of God's holy covenant, with severe spiritual and social consequences.Satan's Role in Promoting Divorce According to Islamic SourcesAccording to various Islamic theological texts and Hadiths, Satan (Shayṭān) actively promotes discord in marriages. Sheikh Dr. Ahmad H. Sakr, in his workAsili ya Majini(The Nature of Jinn), writes on page 39:“The greatest effort of Satan is to create separation between husband and wife. By doing so, he ensures that they begin to hate each other. Eventually, this leads to divorce. This breakup creates dysfunction in the family. When separation or divorce occurs, children are not raised adequately by one parent alone. They lack emotional stability, which makes it easier for Satan (the jinn) to enter into their hearts and minds. He will then lead them astray, causing them to become criminals in society.”This Islamic view aligns with the biblical perspective that Satan is the destroyer of families (John 10:10), and divorce is one of his primary tools.Allah as the Legislator of Divorce: A Quranic OverviewDespite acknowledging that Satan is behind the destruction of families, the Qur'an paradoxically attributes the legislation and regulation of divorce directly to Allah.Surah Al-Ahzab (33:49):“O you who believe! When you marry believing women, and then divorce them before you have touched them, there is no waiting period (iddah) for you to count concerning them. So provide for them and release them in a handsome manner.”Surah Al-Baqarah (2:230):“And if he divorces her [for the third time], then she is not lawful to him afterward until she marries another husband. If the latter divorces her, then there is no sin upon them to return to each other if they think they can keep within the limits of Allah.”These verses reveal not only the permissibility but also the systematic structure of divorce under Islamic law. They suggest that Allah is not merely allowing divorce but actively organizing the manner in which it should occur.Theological Implications: Who is Allah?If Satan is said to delight in breaking apart marriages, and Allah provides detailed guidance on how to do so, then a moral contradiction arises. According to Islamic theology, Allah is the source of these divorce laws. Yet, the resulting harm—broken families, psychologically wounded children, and moral chaos—is consistent with what Satan desires.This leads to a provocative theological question:If the fruits of divorce align with Satan’s goals, and Allah is the author of divorce laws, then can Allah be truly righteous and holy?In Christian theology, a god who promotes actions with demonic outcomes cannot be the same as the holy and loving Creator described in the Bible. Jesus Christ said, “A house divided against itself cannot stand” (Mark 3:25). If Allah both permits what Satan promotes, and that permission brings forth evil, can he be the true God?Conclusion: The True Character of God and the Sanctity of MarriageThis analysis reveals a stark contrast between the God of the Bible and the Allah of the Qur’an in matters of marriage and divorce. The God of the Bible desires lifelong covenant, unity, and love, and views divorce as a painful fracture of His intended design. Conversely, Allah not only permits but regulates and institutionalizes divorce, even when such practices are admitted to cause societal decay and family dysfunction.Thus, from a biblical and theological standpoint,the character of Allah as described in Islamic doctrine aligns more closely with the destructive intentions of Satan than with the righteousness of the Holy God of Scripture.BibliographyHoly Bible, ESV, Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:3-6; Malachi 2:16; 1 Corinthians 7:39The Quran, Surah Al-Ahzab (33:49), Surah Al-Baqarah (2:230)Sakr, Ahmad H.,Asili ya Majini, Islamic Foundation, pg. 39Shimba, Max.Personal Theological Blog Post, April 29, 2018Titus 2:13 – “Waiting for our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ.”",

    "full_content": "Thursday, May 25, 2017By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteMuslims have continually misled people with the claim thatJesus was a Muslimsimply becauseHe prostrated Himself in prayer. This has become one of their main arguments on social media and in public debates, and unfortunately, through this deception, they have managed to convince many to leave Christianity and convert to Islam — all because they were told that“Jesus prostrated,”so therefore,Jesus was a Muslim!😨😨😨This is truly sad, as the Scripture says:➡“My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.”⬅—Hosea 4:6This deception thrives primarily because many Christians are negligent and unwilling to study the Bible for themselves. Some don't even own a Bible! So when a deceptive Muslim presents their arguments, such Christians are easily swayed — they don’t stand a chance because they are unprepared. How can you refute someone when you don’t even know your own Scriptures? 😎😎Let’s address the topic: ⤵⤵Muslims claim thatJesus was a Muslimsimply becauseHe prostrated.(According to their logic, anyone who performs an act similar to theirs — such as prostrating, wearing a robe, or having a beard — is automatically a Muslim, even if that person never heard of Allah or entered a mosque! 😂😂)For instance, since Jesus wore a robe and had a beard, Muslims say, “He was a Muslim!”So to them, Islam is just about outward appearances — robes, beards, and prostration. Anyone doing such is declared a Muslim!They often begin their deception by asking:“Do you know Jesus prostrated? And who else prostrates today?”If you answer,“Muslims,”they triumphantly reply,“See! Jesus was a Muslim because Muslims prostrate and Christians don’t!”😵😵😵Then they might ask:“You Christians kneel — where did you get that from, since Jesus prostrated?”This is a weak and laughable argument.😂😂😂😂😂😂Here’s what they usually cite:Matthew 26:39➡“And He went a little farther, and fell on His face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.”⬅☝☝☝☝This is the verse they use to deceive people, saying “Jesus was a Muslim” becauseHe prostrated.😂😂But pay close attention:The verse doesnotsay “Jesus prostrated.”It says“He fell on His face.”There is a difference betweenprostratingandfalling on your face(also translated as lying prostrate or flat on the ground).In Islamic prostration:Knees touch the groundPalms touch the groundToes point forwardForehead and nose touch the groundBut thechest, stomach, and thighs don’t touch the groundThebuttocks remain raised— this is the Islamic posture of sujood (prostration).Butfalling on your facemeans lyingcompletely flaton the ground — from the face to the chest, stomach, thighs, and legs — the whole body touches the ground! The buttocks donotremain elevated as in Islamic prostration.(See the picture below of a bishop lying flat in prayer — that’s falling on the face, as Jesus did.)So where in the Bible does it say“Jesus prostrated”?Nowhere! Muslims useMatthew 26:39, but it doesn’t saysujood— it says Hefell on His face.Do Muslims fall flat like that when they pray? No.Therefore,Jesus was not a Muslim.Even if He had prostrated in the Islamic fashion,that wouldn’t make Him a Muslim.If I prostrate today, does that make me a Muslim?Many beings prostrate — does that make them Muslim too? Dogs, pigs, jinn, and other creatures all prostrate — so, are they Muslims too?Quran 16:49says:➡“And to Allah prostrates whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth of moving creatures and the angels...”⬅Also,Quran 13:15says:➡“And unto Allah prostrates whoever is in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly, and their shadows as well in the mornings and the evenings.”⬅So, by that logic, evendogs, pigs, turtles, lizards, insects— all are Muslims? 😂😂😀😀Muslims, are we together?You claim Jesus fell on His face, so He was a Muslim.But evenunclean spirits (demons)fell on their faces before Jesus:Mark 3:11➡“Whenever the unclean spirits saw Him, they fell down before Him and cried out, ‘You are the Son of God!’”⬅So… are those demons Muslims too?Or what about this man possessed by demons?Mark 5:2-3,6➡2 When Jesus got out of the boat, a man with an impure spirit came from the tombs to meet him.3 This man lived in the tombs...6 When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell on his knees in front of him.⬅If Islam is defined by prostrating, thenall these creatures and beings are Muslims!😀😀😀This is why I say:Jesus is NOT a Muslim.He did NOT prostrate as Muslims do.Even if He had, it wouldn’t make Him a Muslim — people are not made Muslims by mere acts of posture!As for that question Muslims ask:“Where did Christians get kneeling from, when Jesus prostrated?”Answer:First of all —Jesus didn’t prostrate!Second, nowhere in Scripture does God demand worship in onlyone specific posture.Whether you kneel, stand, fall flat, or even prostrate like Muslims — God looks at theheart, not merely the posture.Christians do all these postures — but Muslims stubbornly hold onto one. For them, kneeling is almost considered a sin!Yet even kings, prophets, and apostlesknelt in prayer:✔King Solomon knelt in prayer:1 Kings 8:54➡“When Solomon finished all these prayers and supplications to the Lord, he rose from before the altar of the Lord, where he had been kneeling with his hands spread out toward heaven.”⬅✔King David also knelt:Psalm 95:6➡“Come, let us bow down in worship, let us kneel before the Lord our Maker.”⬅You’re free to choose — bow or kneel!✔Daniel knelt:Daniel 6:10➡“Now when Daniel learned that the decree had been published, he went home... he got down on his knees three times a day and prayed, giving thanks to his God...”⬅✔Stephen knelt before dying:Acts 7:59-60➡“While they were stoning him, Stephen prayed, ‘Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.’ Then he fell on his knees and cried out, ‘Lord, do not hold this sin against them.’ When he had said this, he fell asleep.”⬅✔ And yes, evenJesusknelt to pray:Luke 22:41➡“He withdrew about a stone’s throw beyond them, knelt down and prayed.”⬅👏👏(Muslims somehownever quotethis verse — where Jesuskneelsin prayer!)So we Christians follow Jesus, the prophets, and the apostles bykneeling in prayer.God is not concerned withform, but withreverence, respect, and fear of Him.Don’t sit casually as if you’re in a bar —God is not your buddy.Don’t let Muslims deceive you.Jesus is not a Muslim— and never will be!Any questions? You're welcome!God bless you all!— Dr. Maxwell Shimba, a servant of Christ Jesus.✋✋",

    "full_content": "Sunday, April 30, 2017JESUS IS GOD “THE WORD FROM ALLAH” ACCORDING TO THE QURANAllah says Jesus is the WORDThe Bible says that the Word is GodAllah says that Jesus in the Quran is the WORD that came from Him. This means that the origin of Jesus is not human, but rather the Word that comes from God. The very same Quran says that the Word of Allah has no beginning, meaning the Word of Allah has always been with Allah and was not created. (Allah’s word is eternal) See Surah 6:115, Surah 10:64, Surah 18:27.Let’s read the verses from the Quran which state that Jesus is the WORD:Surah Al Imran 45: “When the angels said: O Mary! Indeed Allah gives you good news of a Word from Him. His name will be the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, held in honor in this world and the Hereafter, and of those nearest to Allah.”The Quran acknowledges that Mary had a child THROUGH THE WORD OF ALLAH. Therefore, Jesus’ origin is the WORD and not simply human. Refer to Surah Al Imran verse 45.Surah An-Nisaa 171: “O People of the Book! Do not go to excess in your religion, nor say anything about Allah except the truth. The Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, was only a messenger of Allah, and His WORD which He conveyed to Mary, and a spirit from Him. So believe in Allah and His messengers, and do not say ‘Three.’ Cease! (It is) better for you. Allah is only one God. Glory be to Him! (Far Exalted is He) above having a son. His is whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And Allah is sufficient as Disposer of affairs.”Allah continues to say that Jesus is HIS WORD. Therefore, Jesus, who is the Word of God, was with God always. See also Surah 6:115, Surah 10:64, Surah 18:27.What does the Bible say about the WORD?THE BIBLE SAYS THE WORD IS GODJohn 1:1:“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.”In John chapter 1, verse 1, we are taught that the WORD was with God in the beginning before anything was created. At the same time, the Quran says that Allah created Jesus by the Word which was with Allah from the very beginning.I would like you to know that the Quran, which says that Jesus was created from the WORD, was written 632 years after the Bible. This means the Bible was written first, and then the Quran followed.ALLAH TELLS YOU, WHO HAVE DOUBTS:If you do not believe what Max Shimba says, then ask the People of the Book. We Christians and Jews are the People of the Book. Allah means that the People of the Book—that is, us Christians and Jews—have the right and authority to verify the claims of the Quran as true or false. Read:Surah Yunus 94:“If you are in doubt concerning what We have revealed to you, then ask those who read the Book before you. The truth has certainly come to you from your Lord, so do not be among those who doubt.”This verse from Surah Yunus, which was revealed in Mecca and translated by Sheikh Ali Muhsin Al-Barwani, confirms that the People of the Book are those with the authority to verify the truth of the Quran. I therefore confirm that JESUS IS THE WORD, and THE WORD IS GOD, as these were stated 632 years before the revelation of Surah Yunus in Mecca and can be found in the Gospel of John, chapter 1, verse 1.Allah tells Muhammad in Surah Yunus verse 94 that if Muhammad has any doubts about the truth that Jesus is the Word and the Word is God, then Muhammad should ask Christians: “Are these claims of Allah true?” The Bible is complete and affirms, without any doubt, that Jesus is the Word and the Word was with God before the beginning. Allah Himself also admits that Jesus is the Word which was with God even before the beginning.Today, I have answered the question of Muslims: Is Jesus God? Both the Quran and Allah say that Jesus is the WORD, and the Bible says that the WORD IS GOD.In His service,Dr. Maxwell ShimbaCopyright © Max Shimba Ministries 2015",

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteOriginally written: Wednesday, March 29, 2017IntroductionSince the establishment of the covenant between God and the nation of Israel at Mount Sinai, the biblical record consistently portrays a divine pattern whereby God communicates and relates to humanity through the ministry ofpriests. In this arrangement, there existed aHigh Priest (Kuhani Mkuu)and subordinate priests who operated under his authority.According to the Old Testament (Tanakh), among the twelve tribes of Israel, God specifically chose the tribe ofLevito serve as priests.Deuteronomy 10:8 (NKJV)“At that time the Lord separated the tribe of Levi to bear the ark of the covenant of the Lord, to stand before the Lord to minister to Him and to bless in His name, to this day.”This Levite priesthood was tasked with the care of the tabernacle (the Tent of Meeting), the sacred articles, and everything pertaining to the rituals of Israel’s worship.Numbers 1:50 (NKJV)“But you shall appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of the Testimony, over all its furnishings, and over all things that belong to it; they shall carry the tabernacle and all its furnishings; they shall attend to it and camp around the tabernacle.”At the head of this Levitical order wasAaron, who was anointed as the firstHigh Priestof Israel.The New Testament Shift: The Priesthood of MelchizedekWith the coming ofJesus Christ, a new covenant was established, along with a new priesthood. The writer of Hebrews affirms that Jesus did not serve under the Levitical priesthood but rather after the order ofMelchizedek—a mysterious figure who appears in Genesis 14 and is referenced in Psalm 110:4.Hebrews 7:15-17 (NKJV)“And it is yet far more evident if, in the likeness of Melchizedek, there arises another priest who has come, not according to the law of a fleshly commandment, but according to the power of an endless life. For He testifies: ‘You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.’”Unlike the Levitical priesthood, which was based on hereditary descent and legal prescriptions, Christ’s priesthood is eternal and grounded in divine decree.Christ as the Eternal High PriestConsequently,Jesus is the sole High Priest in this New Covenant era, fulfilling the role eternally:Hebrews 7:24 (NKJV)“But He, because He continues forever, has an unchangeable priesthood.”And under His eternal priesthood, all true ministers of God today—whether pastors, evangelists, or spiritual leaders—serve aspriests under the authority of Jesus Christ.1 Peter 2:9 (NKJV)“But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, His own special people, that you may proclaim the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.”This passage affirms the priestly status of all believers under the New Covenant, with Jesus as the unchallenged and eternal High Priest.Theological Inquiry Concerning MuhammadThis brings us to a critical theological examination concerningMuhammad, the founder of Islam. According to Islamic claims, Muhammad served as a prophet and spiritual leader. However, examining his ministry through a biblical-theological lens raises important questions regarding his priestly authority and divine legitimacy.Key Questions:Was Muhammad a priest?The biblical framework for priesthood requires either ordination under the Levitical order (Old Covenant) or under the eternal priesthood of Jesus Christ (New Covenant). There is no record or claim, even within Islamic sources, of Muhammad being a priest in any biblical or Levitical sense.If he was a priest, under which priesthood did he serve? Was it under the Levitical priesthood, or under Jesus Christ?Since the Levitical priesthood ceased with the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple in 70 A.D. and was already declared obsolete in light of Christ’s eternal priesthood (Hebrews 8:13), and given that Muhammad was neither a Levite nor a follower of Jesus Christ’s priestly order, he cannot be classified under either.If not, from which god did his authority originate?This is a pivotal theological question. If Muhammad did not serve under the God of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and the revealed order of priesthood established in both the Old and New Testaments, one must critically question the divine source of his spiritual authority.Dear Muslim brethren, who is your priest?Every spiritual system requires a mediatorial figure between humanity and the divine. In biblical theology, Jesus isthe only mediator between God and mankind(1 Timothy 2:5). If Muhammad is not a priest after God’s established orders, and Islam rejects the priesthood of Christ, it leaves a significant theological vacuum regarding mediation and priestly representation before God.ConclusionThe priesthood ofJesus Christstands supreme, eternal, and exclusive in the New Covenant era. The claims of any subsequent prophet, including Muhammad, must be measured against the divine priestly order established in Scripture. The absence of a recognized, biblically sanctioned priestly role for Muhammad raises critical questions about his theological legitimacy within the framework of revealed Judeo-Christian tradition.Abiria chunga maisha yako (Passengers, take care of your life)!There is no one like Jesus!Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

When I say this, I mean that although you think you are fully aware, your belief about Christians—that they are infidels—is based solely on what you have been taught. You accepted it because the Quran says so:“And the Jews say, ‘Uzair is the son of God,’ and the Christians say, ‘The Messiah is the son of God.’ That is their statement from their mouths; they imitate the saying of those who disbelieved before. May Allah destroy them; how they are deluded!”—Al-Tawba (9:30)Upon reading this verse, a Muslim is led to believe that Christians are infidels simply because they claim that Jesus is the Son of God. You believe that these words—Jesus being the Son of God—are invented by Christians themselves, and therefore, you consider us infidels. You rejoice that the Quran came to warn against this:“And to warn those who say, ‘Allah has taken a son.’”—Al-Kahf (18:4)“They have no knowledge of it, nor do their forefathers. Grave is the word that comes out of their mouths; they speak not except a lie.”—Al-Kahf (18:5)You accept without reflection that the Quran came to warn Christians for claiming that God has a son. But before you jump to labeling Christians as infidels, awaken and examine the truth. Today, I want to awaken you so that if you desire to enter the Kingdom of God, you may join me in understanding.Do Christians Truly Say That Jesus Is the Son of God?This is a crucial question to ask before accepting that Christians speak falsely or that calling them infidels is justified. Before Christians existed, and before Jesus—the origin of Christianity—was born, the angel announced to Mary:Luke 1:30–35: “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you shall name him Jesus. He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High; the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David. His kingdom will have no end. The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore, the child to be born will be holy, the Son of God.”It was the angel who proclaimed that Jesus would be called the Son of God, not the Christians themselves. Even God affirmed this truth:Matthew 17:1–6: Jesus took Peter, James, and John up a high mountain. There, his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became white as light. Suddenly, Moses and Elijah appeared and spoke with him. A bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said: “This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased. Listen to him.”Ask yourself, Muslim reader: Were the angel and God themselves Christians? Can God or His angels be infidels? Even Jesus confirmed his identity as the Son of God:John 9:35–38: “Do you believe in the Son of God?” Jesus asked. The man replied, “Who is he, Lord, that I may believe?” Jesus said, “You have seen him; he is speaking to you.” The man said, “I believe, Lord,” and worshiped him.Could Jesus truly be an infidel? He is the one revealing to Christians that he is the Son of God, and Peter acknowledged this truth (Matthew 16:13–17).Christians Are Not InfidelsSaying Jesus is the Son of God is a divine revelation. So why do Muslims believe that Christians are infidels for acknowledging this truth? Muhammad framed it as a test, suggesting that acknowledging Jesus as the Son of God makes one a disbeliever—but the Scriptures themselves (Nehemiah 5:8–9; Galatians 3:26–29) show otherwise. Christians did not become infidels merely by believing in Jesus; rather, true infidelity was opposed to the Jewish people, the enemies of God’s chosen people.Moreover, the Quran itself shows the context:“You will surely find the most intense of the people in animosity toward the believers [to be] the Jews and those who associate others with Allah; and you will find the nearest in affection to the believers to be those who say, ‘We are Christians.’ That is because among them are priests and monks, and because they are not arrogant.”—Al-Maaida (5:82)Thus, Muslims are told that Jews are their primary enemies. Friendship with Jews is prohibited (Al-Maaida 5:51). True awakening requires understanding that you are not justified in labeling Christians as infidels merely for acknowledging Jesus as the Son of God.Faith and SalvationBelief in Jesus as the Son of God brings eternal life:John 3:16–17: “For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.”John 3:36: “Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not believe the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.”Muhammad warned of God’s wrath because he did not know the fate of his own soul regarding the Kingdom of God. But the Bible clearly teaches that acknowledging Jesus as the Son of God is the path to salvation, not disbelief:Maryam 19:88–90: The Quran exaggerates the reaction to this truth as if the heavens would split and the mountains collapse. This hyperbole demonstrates that calling Jesus the Son of God is not truly infidelity.Therefore, awaken today, Muslim reader, and recognize that believing Jesus is the Son of God does not make one an infidel.Max Shimba Ministries Org",

This hyperbole demonstrates that calling Jesus the Son of God is not truly infidelity.Therefore, awaken today, Muslim reader, and recognize that believing Jesus is the Son of God does not make one an infidel.Max Shimba Ministries Org",

We read:Arabic Hadith Text:عَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُ قَالَ : قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ ((اسْتَأْذَنْتُ رَبِّي أَنْ أَسْتَغْفِرَ لأُمِّي فَلَمْ يَأْذَنْ لِي ، وَاسْتَأْذَنْتُهُ أَنْ أَزُورَ قَبْرَهَا فَأَذِنَ لِي )) مسلمTranslation of the Hadith:From Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him) said:“I asked my Lord for permission to seek forgiveness for my mother, but He did not permit me. I asked Him for permission to visit her grave, and He permitted me.”(Sahih Muslim)It is explained in the book‘Awn al-Ma‘bud:“His statement ((But He did not permit me)) means that (his mother) was an unbeliever, and it is not allowed to ask forgiveness for an unbeliever.”This is another calamity for Muslims:Both of Muhammad’s parents died while guilty of great sins and while they were UNBELIEVERS.Why did Allah hate Muhammad’s parents so much?Do you know that Muhammad’s father also died as an UNBELIEVER and is burning in Hell?Truly, there are many strange things in Islam.And yet,we never read that the mother of Jesus died in sin.MUHAMMAD ADMITS THAT HIS FATHER IS IN HELLThis is a VERY GREAT CALAMITY for Muslims.Muhammad’s father was namedAbdullah, which means “servant of Allah.”Yet Muhammad confirmed that he is in Hell burning.These are not my words; I am not inventing anything about Muhammad’s father.These are the words of Muhammad himself.Read the evidence:Reported by Anas: A man said, “Messenger of Allah, where is my father?”He said:“He is in Hell.”When the man turned away, he called him back and said:“Indeed, my father and your father are in Hell.”(Sahih Muslim, Book 001, Number 0398)Now, the question Muslims should ask is this:Why was Muhammad’s father, a pagan, named “Abdullah”?Since “Abdullah” means “servant of Allah,” this is clear evidence that pagans of the Jahiliyyah era were already worshippingAllah, even naming their children after him — in the same way Jews named their children in honor of the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob:Joshua –Yahweh is salvationJotham –Yahweh is perfectJehoahaz –Yahweh has graspedHezekiah –Yahweh strengthensElisha –God is salvation, etc.The answer is clear:Allah was a pagan deity long before Islam.He was themoon god,al-ilah.Another name for him wasHubal.This pagan god was worshipped throughout the Middle East, not only by the Arabs.MORE THAN THAT:1. Why does Muhammad admit his father is in Hell?2. Where did this pagan Abdullah get a name containing “Allah”?3. Does this mean Allah — a pagan god — existed before Muhammad?And this is why Muhammad’s grandfather,Abdul Muttalib, almost sacrificed Muhammad’s father Abdullah as an offering to Allah. He was saved by his uncle, after which 100 camels were sacrificed instead.This sacrifice took place at the Kaaba (we will analyze this later).We are told:“The arrow showed that Abdullah was the one to be sacrificed. So Abdul Muttalib took the boy to the Kaaba with a knife to slaughter him. Quraysh, his uncle from the Makhzum tribe, and his brother Abu Talib tried to stop him. They suggested he consult a female soothsayer. She ordered that divination arrows be drawn between Abdullah and ten camels… eventually the number of camels reached one hundred.”(Ibn Hisham 1/151–155;Rahmat-ul-lil’alameen2/89–90)This is why the God of the Bible constantly warned Israel against the pagan practices of surrounding nations — including worship of the moon, stars, and celestial hosts.Scriptures:Deuteronomy 4:19Deuteronomy 17:2–32 Kings 21:3, 52 Kings 23:5Jeremiah 8:2Jeremiah 19:13Zephaniah 1:5THE YEAR MUHAMMAD WAS BORNIn 570 AD, the year Muhammad was born, there ruled in Yemen an Ethiopian Aksumite governor namedAbrahah al-Ashram.He was jealous of Mecca because so many people visited it for pagan pilgrimage.So he built a large church in Sana’a hoping to attract pilgrims — but nobody came.He then marched to Mecca with a huge army and elephants to destroy the Kaaba.The Quraysh united to defend the Kaaba.Muhammad’s grandfather Abdul Muttalib told the people to hide in the mountains while he stayed near the Kaaba.But because the army of Abrahah was so powerful, Abdul Muttalib said:“The Owner of this House will protect it, and surely He will save it from enemies, and they will not disgrace His servants.”Tradition says flocks of birds rained stones on Abrahah’s army.He was wounded and retreated.But here is the problem:At that time Muhammad was just a baby.Islam did not yet exist.The Kaaba was full of pagan idols.So who was“the Owner of the House”that Abdul Muttalib referred to?It was clearlya pagan god, the moon deity — Allah (al-ilah).The Qur’an says in Surah Al-Fil (105:1–5):“Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with the companions of the elephant?Did He not make their plot go astray?And He sent against them birds in flocks,Striking them with stones of baked clay,And He made them like eaten straw.”But these events occurredbefore Islam, in apagansetting.So who is “your Lord” here?Who protected the Kaaba — a pagan shrine filled with idols?It was not Allah of Islam, because Islam didn’t exist.It was thesame pagan Allahworshipped by Abdul Muttalib — the moon god.Therefore:The Kaaba is a pagan house.Muhammad’s father is in Hell.All Muslims who go on pilgrimage are honoring a pagan site.Allah is a pagan god.Truly, Islam is a pagan religion — which is why Muhammad admitted his father is in Hell.I invite you to the true and living God,JESUS CHRIST OUR SAVIOR.May God bless you abundantly.I am Dr. Max Shimba,a servant of Jesus Christ.For Max Shimba Ministries Org.MAX SHIMBA MINISTRIES ORG ©2016.

If he himself had no assurance of forgiveness, how could he forgive her sins?MUHAMMAD ASKED FOR FORGIVENESS ONE HUNDRED TIMES PER DAYInSahih Muslim, Book 35, Number 6522, it states that the Prophet Muhammad was so sinful that he asked Allah for forgiveness one hundred times every day.Quote:“Al-Agharr al-Muzani, one of the companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), reported that the Messenger of Allah said: ‘Sometimes a veil is cast over my heart, and I seek forgiveness from Allah one hundred times a day.’”Notice that the Islamic tradition not only declares Muhammad sinful, but also reveals that he felt aveil—a dark or troubling feeling—over his heart. Yet according to the Qur’an, Muhammad is supposed to be the perfect model for life and conduct.So how could Muhammad have a dark veil over his heart?Where did this heaviness come from, especially if he was receiving “revelation” from Allah?Could it be possible that the so-called revelation itself was the darkness filling his heart?The Qur’an (68:4)“Your life and conduct is an example.”(Mohammed Knut Bernström, The Qur’an)All Humanity Has SinnedThe Bible teaches that all human beings have sinned. This includes Muhammad—he was a sinner just like all other people.But Muhammad himself admitted that his sins werenot forgiven, despite asking for forgiveness one hundred times a day.Dear reader, why should we follow or listen to Muhammad, who openly admitted that his sins remained unforgiven?Why did Allah fail to forgive Muhammad’s sins?Does Allah even have the power to forgive sin?Muhammad is the only religious founder who diedin his sins, andthe wages of sin is death in hell.Romans 6:23“For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.”Because the sinner is condemned to die:“And just as it is appointed for man to die once, and after that comes judgment.”(Hebrews 9:27)Why die in your sins like Muhammad, and be eternally separated from God in Hell?My friend,I ask you the most important question of your life. Your eternal joy—or your eternal sorrow—depends on your answer. The question is this:Are you saved?Not:How good are you?Not:Do you belong to a church?But simply:Are you saved?Are you certain that you will go to heaven when you die?Make sure that you are saved. If you lose your soul, you lose heaven, and you lose everything.

Muhammad’s father, named Abdullah (meaning “servant of Allah”), is confirmed to be in Hell/burning in the fire.These are not my words nor am I slandering Muhammad’s father; these are the words of Muhammad himself.Read the evidence here:It is reported by Anas:A man said, “Messenger of Allah, where is my father?” He said, “In the Fire.” When the man turned away, he called him back and said, “Verily, my father and your father are in the Fire.” (Sahih Muslim, Book 001, Number 0398).The question Muslims should ask themselves is: why was Muhammad’s father, a pagan, named ‘Abdullah’?And since ‘Abdullah’ means ‘servant of Allah’, it is clear evidence that pagans during the time of ignorance (Jahiliyyah) used to worship Allah, to the point that they named their children in honor of Allah—just as the Jews would name their children in honor of the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.For example:Joshua – Yahweh is salvationJotham – Yahweh is perfectJehoahaz – Yahweh has heldHezekiah – Yahweh strengthensElisha – God is salvation, etc.The answer is clear: Allah was a pagan god worshipped before Islam came. This god was the “moon god,” known as “al-ilah.” Another name for him was “Hubal.” This pagan god was worshipped throughout the Middle East, not just by the Arabs.MOREOVER,Why does Muhammad admit his father is in Hell?Where did this Abdullah/Abdallah get the name that contains Allah?Does this mean Allah, a pagan god, existed before Muhammad?And that is why Muhammad’s father, Abdullah, was nearly sacrificed by Muhammad’s grandfather, Abdul Muttalib. Abdul Muttalib wanted to sacrifice his son as an offering to Allah. But Abdullah’s uncle saved him, and instead, 100 camels were sacrificed. And it should be noted that this sacrifice took place at the Kaaba (which we will discuss further later).We are told:The arrow showed that Abdullah was to be sacrificed. Therefore, Abdul Muttalib took the boy to the Kaaba with a razor to slaughter him. The Quraish, his uncle from the Makhzum tribe, and his brother Abu Talib tried to dissuade him. They suggested he consult a female diviner. She instructed that divining arrows be drawn between Abdullah and ten camels… finally, the number of camels reached one hundred. (Ibn Hisham 1/151-155; Rahmat-ul-lil’alameen 2/89, 90).That’s why the God of the Bible warned the Israelites so much about the pagan practices of the nations around them, especially regarding worship of the star family or the host of heaven. For example, He says:“And beware not to lift up your eyes to heaven and see the sun and the moon and the stars, all the host of heaven, and be drawn away and worship them and serve them, those which the LORD your God has allotted to all the peoples under the whole heaven.” (Deuteronomy 4:19)“If there is found among you, within any of your gates which the LORD your God gives you, a man or a woman who does evil in the sight of the LORD your God, in transgressing His covenant, and has gone and served other gods and worshipped them, either the sun or moon or any of the host of heaven, which I have not commanded...” (Deuteronomy 17:2-3)“He rebuilt the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he erected altars for Baal, made an Asherah as Ahab king of Israel had done, and worshipped all the host of heaven and served them.” (2 Kings 21:3)“He built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.” (2 Kings 21:5)“He removed the idolatrous priests whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah and in the places all around Jerusalem, and those who burned incense to Baal, to the sun, to the moon, to the constellations, and to all the host of heaven.” (2 Kings 23:5)“And they will spread them out before the sun and the moon and all the host of heaven, which they have loved, and which they have served, and which they have gone after, and which they have sought, and which they have worshipped. They will not be gathered or buried; they will be as dung on the face of the earth.” (Jeremiah 8:2)“...and the houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah shall be defiled like the place of Topheth—all the houses on whose roofs they have burned incense to all the host of heaven, and poured out drink offerings to other gods.” (Jeremiah 19:13)“...and those who worship the host of heaven on the housetops, and those who worship and swear oaths by the LORD but who also swear by Milcom...” (Zephaniah 1:5)In the year 570 AD, the very year Muhammad was born, there was a ruler of the Aksumite empire of Ethiopia who was stationed in Yemen. He was called Abrahah al-Ashram. It is said he was envious of Mecca because of the many people who made pilgrimage (a pagan pilgrimage), so he built a great church in Sana’a, Yemen, hoping to attract pilgrims, but they did not come.As a result, he decided to invade Mecca to destroy the Kaaba. He traveled with his army atop many elephants—hence, that year became known as the “Year of the Elephant.”The Quraysh clans united to try to save the Kaaba. Abdul Muttalib (Muhammad’s grandfather) told people to hide in the mountains while he and some others stayed near the Kaaba.But because of the size and power of Abrahah’s army, Abdul Muttalib said:“The Owner of this House will defend it, and I am sure He will save it from the enemy's attacks and will not allow His servants to be humiliated.”Tradition says that as Abrahah approached the Kaaba, a large flock of birds appeared, pelting the army with stones until they were wounded. Thus, Abrahah’s mission failed, and he returned wounded.Now, the question is, if at that time Muhammad was still an infant, Islam had not yet started, and at the Kaaba there were hundreds of pagan gods, who was the “Owner of the House” Abdul Muttalib spoke of?It is clear this was a pagan god, the moon god, worshipped and served by Abdul Muttalib—meaning the “moon god.”An even bigger question is that the Quran says in Surah Al-Fil (The Elephant) 105:1-5:“Have you not considered how your Lord dealt with the companions of the elephant? Did He not make their plan go astray? And He sent against them birds, in flocks, Striking them with stones of hard clay, And He made them like eaten straw.”The question is:These events took place before Islam, in the time of paganism. The servant of the pagan god, Abdul Muttalib, said the Owner of the House would defend it.So, who was the Owner of the House mentioned by Abdul Muttalib, and who is the Lord mentioned by the Quran in this surah? Or should we say there were two gods working together to throw stones at Abrahah and his elephants?Abdul Muttalib did not know the Allah of Muhammad, so in any case, he could not have mentioned him (if indeed the Allah of Muhammad was different from that of Abdul Muttalib).All the evidence shows that the moon god worshipped by Abdul Muttalib is the one who protected the Kaaba from Abrahah’s elephants. Therefore, this Quranic verse cannot claim to refer to a god different from that one!Therefore, the Kaaba is a pagan house.Therefore, the father of Muhammad is in Hell.Therefore, all Muslims who go on pilgrimage will enter Hell.Therefore, Allah is a pagan god.Indeed, Islam is a religion of pagans; that is why Muhammad admitted that his father is in Hell.I invite you to the Most High, the Living God, JESUS OUR SAVIOR.God bless you all.It is I, Dr. Maxwell Shimba, servant of Jesus Christ,For Max Shimba Ministries Org,MAX SHIMBA MINISTRIES ORG ©2016.

This is a Book whose verses have been made clear, then detailed, from One who is Wise and All-Aware.Surah Al-An’am (6:114)\"Shall I seek a judge other than Allah, while He is the One who has sent down to you the Book explained in detail? Those whom We gave the Scripture know it has been sent down from your Lord in truth. So do not be among the doubters.\"Surah An-Nahl (16:89)\"And [warn of] the Day when We will raise from every nation a witness against them, and We will bring you as a witness over these people. And We have sent down to you the Book explaining everything, as guidance, mercy, and glad tidings for the Muslims.\"The above Surahs claim that the Quran isfully explained,clear, and that when you read it, you should not encounter confusion or contradictions.BUT THESE CLAIMS CONTRADICT THE CONFUSION FOUND IN ANOTHER VERSE, WHICH CLAIMS THATONLY ALLAH KNOWS THE MEANING OF SOME VERSESLet us read this verse:Surah Al-Imran (3:7)\"He is the One who has sent down to you the Book. Within it are verses that are clear and decisive—these are the foundation of the Book. But others are ambiguous. As for those in whose hearts is deviation, they follow what is ambiguous, seeking discord and seeking its interpretation. Butno one knows its interpretation except Allah. And those firmly grounded in knowledge say, ‘We believe in it; all is from our Lord.’ But none take heed except those with understanding.\"Dear brothers and sisters, this is another disaster in Islam. In Surah Al-Imran—revealed in Medina—Allah says:In the Quran there aremuhkamat—clear verses with obvious meaning.There are ambiguous verses, and those who follow them do so seeking discord.There are verses whose meaningno one knows except Allah.This Surah 3:7 contradicts Surah Hud 11:1, Surah Al-An’am 6:114, and Surah An-Nahl 16:89—which claim the Quran isclearandfully explained.So, what should Muslims follow?What do Muslims believe about a Quran thatcontradicts itselfandis not clear?Why does Allah contradict Himself in the above verses?Or was the problem Muhammad himself—who couldn’t read or write and failed to properly memorize Jibril’s instructions?Furthermore, why would Allah reveal verses whose meaningonly He knows?How do such verses help Muslims?What benefit do Muslims gain from reading verses whose meaning only Allah knows?Finally, I want to know:How do Muslims know the verses they read are meant to be understood—when Allah has set a trap by saying that some verses in the Quran are knownonlyto Him?Is this not why Muslims fight among themselves—ISIS, Sunni vs Shia, and many others?Is this not why the Quran “needs” the Sahih Hadith and the Suna of Muhammad?This is yet another disaster in the religion of Allah.Why did Allah reveal verses thatonly He understands?Come to Jesus, the Living One, who has given us the Holy Spirit as our Guide.John 16:3But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide you into all truth; for He will not speak on His own, but whatever He hears, He will speak, and He will declare to you the things to come.14He will glorify Me, for He will take what is Mine and declare it to you.15All that the Father has is Mine; therefore I said He will take what is Mine and declare it to you.John 16:26But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things and remind you of all that I have said to you.1 John 2:27But the anointing that you received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone should teach you. But as His anointing teaches you about everything—and is true and not a lie—abide in Him, just as it has taught you.Dear readers, Jesus has already made it clear:If you follow Him, you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit, who will live within you and teach you all things.Come to Jesus.God bless you greatly.Max Shimba Ministries@February 9, 2015",

Many Christians have been asking themselves: Where did witchcraft come from and who was its origin?Today the Qur’an answers you by saying thatwitchcraft WAS CREATED and sent down by Allah, thus the number-one witches are Muslims. I know you think that Max Shimba is falsely accusing Muslims, right?Here we need to understand that witchcraft is an evil thing that sends a person to hellfire. Going to witch doctors and fortune-tellers is part of unbelief and idolatry.Let us read this Qur’anic evidence:Surah Taha 20:73“Indeed, we have believed in our Lord so that He may forgive us our sins and themagicyou forced us to perform. And Allah is the Best and Ever-Lasting.”According to Surah Taha verse 73, as it was revealed in Mecca to Muhammad and translated by Sheikh Ali Muhsin Al-Barwani, it says thatALLAH FORCES MUSLIMS TO PERFORM WITCHCRAFT. This is a tragedy, my brothers. The question is: Since when did God become a magician? And what benefit does this witchcraft, sent down by Allah, have for Muslims?Let us look at the second Tafsir of Surah Taha 73 as translated by Sheikh Ali Muhsin, which says:“For indeed we stand firmly upon faith in believing in our True Lord so that He may erase our past sins and forgive us for engaging in the witchcraftyou forced us to learn and perform!And our Lord is Better in recompense than you if He is obeyed; and His kingdom and ability to repay endures more than yours.”This means:It says that Muslims are forced to learn witchcraft.It says that Muslims are forced to practice witchcraft.Dear reader, today I have little to say because you have read for yourself from the Qur’an that Allah sent down witchcraft and forced Muslims to learn and practice it.I advise Christians who have Muslim friends to be careful, because that friend of yours might be the one bewitching you since he is forced by Allah to do so.I have quoted Qur’an 2:102 and its explanation below from two tafsir translations (Sheikh Abdullah Saleh Al-Farsy and Sheikh Ali Muhsin Al-Barwani). This verse and its commentary show the following:(a) Witchcraft was sent down by Allah’s angels(b) There are Islamic witches(c) Witchcraft is the work of unbeliefAlso, according toSahih Bukhari vol. 4, book 54, hadith 490andSahih Bukhari vol. 7, book 71, hadith 658, Muhammad was bewitched and harmed by witchcraft. The story of the Prophet being bewitched and affected by magic is also narrated in Qur’an tafsir by Sheikh Abdullah Saleh Al-Farsy, pages 977 and 978.QUESTIONS(a) If witchcraft is unbelief, what relationship does Allah have with unbelief for Him to send down witchcraft?(b) Was the Prophet Muhammad bewitched by Islamic witches or by other witches?(c) Was Muhammad bewitched by the witchcraft sent down by Allah’s angels or by some other witchcraft?(d) Which other prophet was ever bewitched and harmed by witchcraft the way Muhammad was?Qur’an 2:102(Arabic text preserved)Qur’an 2:102 (Translation by Sheikh Abdullah Saleh Al-Farsy)“They followed what the devils recited during the reign of Solomon; and Solomon did not disbelieve, but the devils disbelieved, teaching people witchcraft (which they had known long ago and the magic) which was sent down to the two angels Harut and Marut in Babylon. But the two angels would not teach anyone until they warned him:‘Indeed we are a trial (testing your obedience); therefore do not disbelieve.’But they learned from them that by which they could separate a man from his wife (and other things). But they could not harm anyone with it except by permission of Allah. And they learned what harmed them and did not benefit them. And they surely knew that whoever purchased this would have no share in the Hereafter. And surely evil was that for which they sold their souls (of the Hereafter). If only they knew.”(Translation from Abdullah Saleh Al-Farsy, pp. 25–26)Commentary on Qur’an 2:102Solomon mentioned here is a prophet. The Jews call him a king who gained his kingdom through magic, not a prophet. And theseIslamic witches attribute their magical knowledge to Prophet Solomon. So Allah refutes this. And this verse clearly shows that:(a) witchcraft is an act of unbelief(b) a witch cannot harm anyone except by Allah’s permission(c) a witch himself is harmed by his own witchcraftQur’an 2:102 (Translation by Sheikh Ali Muhsin Al-Barwani)“And they followed what the devils fabricated concerning the kingdom of Solomon. But Solomon did not disbelieve, but the devils disbelieved, teaching people witchcraft and that which was sent down to the two angels, Harut and Marut, in Babylon. But they did not teach anyone until they said:‘Indeed we are a trial, therefore do not disbelieve.’But they learned from them that by which they could separate a man from his wife. But they could not harm anyone except by Allah’s permission. And they learned that which harms them and does not benefit them. And they surely knew that whoever chooses this will have no portion in the Hereafter. And surely evil is that for which they sold themselves—if only they knew.”May God have mercy and forgive all our brothers who practice witchcraft.Because the Bible says thatALL WITCHES WILL ENTER HELL.1 Samuel 15:23“…the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry; because you have rejected the word of the LORD, He has also rejected you from being king.”Dear reader, receive the living Jesus and gain eternal life.Religion will not help you at all, because now you understand that it is religion that causes you to become a witch and depart from the love of God.May God bless you greatly.It is I, Max Shimba, a servant of Jesus ChristFor Max Shimba Ministries OrgMAX SHIMBA MINISTRIES ORG ©2016.

Ibn 'Abbaas (Radhiya Allaahu 'anhuma) also said about this verse: \"It refers to songs and foolish words.\" [Authentic Isnaad from Shaykh Al-Albaaniy].SINGERS/LISTENERS OF MUSIC WILL BE TURNED INTO MONKEYS AND PIGSThe Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “There will be among my ummah people who will consider illegal sexual intercourse, the wearing of silk, the drinking of alcoholic drinks, and musical instruments as lawful. And some people will stay near the side of a mountain and their shepherd will come in the evening with their sheep and ask them for something, but they will say: ‘Return to us tomorrow.’ Allah will destroy them during the night and will let the mountain fall on them, and He will transform the rest of them into monkeys and pigs until the Day of Resurrection.” [Al-Bukhaari]This hadith confirms that all these sins are equally forbidden. Just as adultery and alcohol are haram, music is also haram in the same way.So, how can a Muslim see music as not being a major sin to avoid?Imaam Abu Haniyfah said: \"Singing (songs, dancing) is among the major sins that a Muslim should avoid quickly.\" A Muslim should be more fearful of potentially facing the punishment of being transformed into monkeys or pigs for such sins, as warned in the following hadith:The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “There will be among my ummah people who will drink alcohol, calling it by another name, and music will be played for them and female singers will sing for them. Allah will cause the earth to swallow them, and He will turn them into monkeys and pigs.” [Ibn Maajah and authenticated by Shaykh Al-Albaaniy]SORRY TO MUSLIMS BECAUSE ALLAH DOES NOT LIKE TAARAB MUSIC OR BONGO FLEVA MUSICShalom,Dr. Max Shimba, a servant of Jesus Christ, the Great God.

Arethe claims that the Quran is straightforward and clear really true?Allah sends down verses and claims that the Quran is not complete and not clear.Allah says that some verses in the Quran—no one knows their meaning except Allah.Dear readers,Today we will look at the confusion that fills the Quran, which many scholars claim is straightforward, while Allah Himself contradicts them and sends down verses saying that the Quran is not straightforward and is not clear.First, let’s start by looking at the verses that say the Quran is clear and its verses are explained as guidance for those who are guided.Surat HUD (11:1)Alif Lam Ra. This is a Book whose verses are set clear, then explained in detail, from One Who is Wise and All-Aware.Surat Al An’am (6:114)Shall I seek a judge other than Allah, while He it is who has sent down to you the Book explained in detail? Those unto whom We gave the Book know that it is revealed from your Lord in truth, so be not you of the doubters.Surat An-Nahl (16:89)And (warn of) the Day when We will raise up from every nation a witness against them from amongst themselves; and We will bring you as a witness against these. And We have sent down to you the Book explaining everything, a guidance, mercy, and glad tidings for Muslims.The above verses claim that the Quran is clear and its verses are explained in detail. This means that, when reading the Quran, you should not have questions or find confusion in the verses revealed by Allah.BUT THESE CLAIMS CONTRADICT THE CONFUSION FOUND IN THE FOLLOWING VERSE, WHICH CLAIMS THAT THERE ARE VERSES IN THE QURAN WHOSE MEANING IS KNOWN ONLY TO ALLAHLet’s read that verse:Surat Al Imran (3:7)He it is Who has sent down to you the Book; in it are verses that are precise—they are the foundation of the Book—and others ambiguous. As for those in whose hearts is deviation, they follow what is ambiguous of it, seeking discord and seeking its interpretation. And no one knows its interpretation except Allah. But those firm in knowledge say, \"We believe in it. All [of it] is from our Lord.\" And none will be reminded except those of understanding.Dear brothers and sisters, this is another disaster in Islam. In Surat Al Imran, which was revealed in Medina, Allah says:i. Within the Quran there are “muhkam” (precise) verses whose meaning is clear;ii. There are also allegorical verses which those who follow seek discord and search for their meaning;iii. There are verses whose meaning no one knows except Allah.Friends, this Surat 3:7 contradicts Surat HUD 11:1, Surat Al An’am 6:114, and Surat An-Nahl 16:89, which claim that the verses of the Quran are clear and explained in detail.So, which should Muslims follow?What do Muslims believe in this Quran that contradicts itself and is not clear?Why does Allah contradict Himself in these verses above?Or was the problem Muhammad, who could neither read nor write and failed to memorize Gabriel’s instructions?Furthermore, why did Allah reveal verses whose meaning only He knows?How do these verses benefit a Muslim?What benefit do Muslims get when reading these verses, knowing that their meaning is known only to Allah?Finally, I’d like to understand: how do Muslims know that the verses they read are the ones they are supposed to understand, knowing that Allah set a trap by saying there are verses in the Quran whose meaning only Allah knows?Perhaps this is why Muslims fight among themselves, like ISIS, Sunni vs Shia, etc.Maybe that’s why the Quran needs the help of Sahih Hadith and the Sunnah of Muhammad.This is another disaster in the religion of Allah.Why did Allah reveal verses that only He understands?Welcome to Jesus, the living One, who brought us the Holy Spirit as our Guide.John 16:13-15But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide you into all the truth. He will not speak on His own; He will speak only what He hears, and He will tell you what is yet to come. He will glorify me because it is from me that he will receive what he will make known to you. All that belongs to the Father is mine. That is why I said the Spirit will receive from me what he will make known to you.John 16:26But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you.1 John 2:27As for you, the anointing you received from him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about all things and as that anointing is real, not counterfeit—just as it has taught you, remain in him.Dear readers, Jesus has already made it clear that if you follow Him, you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit, and that same Holy Spirit will live within us and will teach us all things.Come to Jesus.God bless you all.Max Shimba Ministries@February 9, 2015http://www.maxshimbaministries.org/…/kumbe-quran-imejaa-sha…",

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteTuesday, December 20, 2016IntroductionThis is a grave matter within the nation of Muhammad. Christians have often wondered: Where did sorcery originate, and who was its author? Today, the Quran responds, declaring that sorcery was created and revealed by Allah. Consequently, Muslims are considered the primary practitioners of sorcery. You may think that I, Max Shimba, am unjustly accusing Muslims, but let us reason together.It is important to clarify that idolatry is an evil practice that leads to destruction. Consulting sorcerers and diviners is a manifestation of unbelief and idolatry. Let us examine the evidence from the Quran.Qur’anic EvidenceSurat Taha 20:73\"Indeed, we have believed in our Lord that He may forgive us our sins and the magic to which you compelled us. And Allah is the best and most enduring.\"According to the translation and commentary by Sheikh Ali Muhsin Al-Barwani, this verse asserts that Allah compelled the people to practice sorcery. This, indeed, is a tragedy, my brethren. One must ask: Since when has God become a sorcerer? What benefit is there in the sorcery revealed by Allah to Muslims?Another interpretation of Surat Taha 20:73 by Sheikh Ali Muhsin states:\"For indeed, we stand firm in faith, believing in our true Lord, so that He may absolve our past sins and forgive us for engaging in the sorcery you compelled us to learn and perform! And our Lord is superior in recompense and His sovereignty endures more than yours.\"From these interpretations, the following points emerge:Muslims are compelled to learn sorcery.Muslims are compelled to practice sorcery.Therefore, it is evident from the Quran that Allah revealed sorcery and compelled Muslims to both learn and practice it.A Pastoral WarningI advise Christians with Muslim friends to exercise caution, for your friend may be compelled by Allah to practice sorcery against you.Analysis of Quran 2:102I now quote Quran 2:102 and its commentary from two renowned scholars—Sheikh Abdullah Saleh Al-Farsy and Sheikh Ali Muhsin Al-Barwani:Quran 2:102\"And they followed [instead] what the devils had recited during the reign of Solomon. It was not Solomon who disbelieved, but the devils disbelieved, teaching people magic and that which was revealed to the two angels at Babylon, Harut and Marut. But they [i.e., the two angels] do not teach anyone unless they say, 'We are a trial, so do not disbelieve [by practicing magic].' And [yet] they learn from them that by which they cause separation between a man and his wife. But they do not harm anyone through it except by permission of Allah. And the people learn what harms them and does not benefit them. But the Children of Israel certainly knew that whoever purchased the magic would not have in the Hereafter any share. And wretched is that for which they sold themselves, if they only knew.\"Sheikh Abdullah Saleh Al-Farsy’s Commentary:He explains that the devils taught people magic, which was sent down to the two angels Harut and Marut in Babylon. However, these angels did not teach anyone without warning that they were a test from God, and that practicing magic is an act of disbelief. Importantly, the magician cannot harm anyone except by Allah’s permission, and the magician himself suffers the consequences of his practice.Sheikh Ali Muhsin Al-Barwani’s Commentary:He states that the devils attributed their magic to the reign of Solomon, yet Solomon did not disbelieve, but the devils did, teaching people magic and that which was revealed to Harut and Marut. These angels would only teach after warning of the test, and the lessons would cause harm, not benefit. Those who chose this path would have no share in the Hereafter.Relevant Hadith EvidenceAccording toSahih Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 54, Hadith 490, and Volume 7, Book 71, Hadith 658, Prophet Muhammad himself was bewitched and suffered from sorcery. This incident is further discussed in the Tafsir of Sheikh Abdullah Saleh Al-Farsy (pages 977–978).Theological Questions RaisedIf sorcery is disbelief (kufr), what is the relationship between Allah and disbelief that He would reveal sorcery?Was Prophet Muhammad bewitched by Muslim sorcerers or others?Was the sorcery that affected Muhammad the same as that revealed to the angels by Allah, or was it different?Is there any other prophet who was bewitched and affected by sorcery as Muhammad was?Biblical PerspectiveThe Bible is clear regarding sorcerers:1 Samuel 15:23\"For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the Lord, He also has rejected you from being king.\"All sorcerers will enter hell (Gehenna), according to the Bible.Final ExhortationDear reader, accept Jesus Christ, the Living One, and receive eternal life. Religion alone will not save you, for now you understand that it is religion that leads one into sorcery and away from the love of God.May God bless you abundantly.By Dr. Maxwell Shimba,Servant of Jesus Christ,For Max Shimba Ministries OrgMAX SHIMBA MINISTRIES ORG ©2016.

One day he said to me:“O ‘Aisha! God has instructed me concerning the matter I asked Him about. Two men came; one sat at my feet and the other near my head. The one near my feet said to the one near my head (pointing at me), ‘What is wrong with this man?’ The other replied, ‘He has been affected by magic.’ The first asked, ‘Who cast the spell on him?’ The other replied, ‘Lubaid bin A’sam.’ The first asked, ‘With what (material)?’ The other replied, ‘With the pollen of a male date palm and a comb, in which hair was placed, and buried under a stone in the well of Dharwan.’”Then the Prophet went to that well and said:“This is the same well that was shown to me in the dream.

Perhaps this is why he said in the hadith below that all sects will enter Hellfire. So, Muhammad will enter Hellfire. So, Muslims will enter Hellfire.Hadith:“The Jews split into seventy-one sects, and the Christians split into seventy-two sects, and my Ummah will split into seventy-three sects. All of them will enter Hellfire…”[Ahmad, Abu Dawood, at-Tirmidhi, and ad-Daarimi]As the evidence says above that all sects will enter Hellfire, now, which is the sect that will not enter Hellfire?Shalom,Dr. Maxwell ShimbaServant of Jesus ChristShimba Theological InstituteTheological and Scholarly Expansion1.Context of Surat Al Ah’qaaf 9Surat Al Ah’qaaf 46:9 states:Say, “I am not a new thing among the Messengers, nor do I know what will be done with me or with you. I only follow that which is revealed to me; I am but a clear warner.”Islamic InterpretationClassical Islamic Scholarsgenerally interpret this verse as a statement of Muhammad’s humility and his role as a prophet who is strictly bound to the revelations from Allah.Tafsir Ibn Kathir:The verse is interpreted to mean that Muhammad is not different from previous messengers, nor does he claim independent knowledge about the ultimate fate of any individual, including himself, except what has been revealed by Allah.Al-Tabarisimilarly explains that the Prophet is emphasizing that he does not possess divine knowledge of the unseen (al-ghayb), which is a trait reserved for Allah alone.Christian and Critical Academic PerspectiveCritical scholarssee this verse as indicative of theuncertainty and human limitationof Muhammad’s role, contrasting sharply with the claims of some Muslims about his intercessory power or unique status.Christian apologistsoften point to this verse to argue that Muhammad himself expressed uncertainty regarding his salvation, which contradicts the certainty of salvation offered through Jesus Christ in the New Testament (e.g., John 14:6, 1 John 5:13).2.The Hadith on Sectarianism“The Jews split into seventy-one sects, the Christians into seventy-two, and my Ummah will split into seventy-three sects. All of them will be in the Fire except one…”[Sources: Ahmad 8492, Abu Dawood 4597, at-Tirmidhi 2641, ad-Daarimi 2517]Islamic ContextThemajority of Islamic scholarsinterpret this hadith as a warning against division and an encouragement to adhere to the Prophet’s example (Sunnah) and the consensus of the community (Jama'ah).The “one group” that will be saved is interpreted differently across sects: Sunni scholars claim it is the Ahl as-Sunnah wal-Jama'ah, while various other sects (e.g., Shia, Sufis) have their own interpretations.Christian and Academic ReflectionChristian theologians see this as evidence of doctrinal uncertainty within Islam, in contrast to the New Testament's teaching on the assurance of salvation for believers in Christ.Sociologists of religionnote that such hadith reflect early Islamic struggles with internal division, mirroring the splits in Judaism and Christianity, but also serve to legitimize certain interpretations over others.3.Theological ReflectionFrom a Christian PerspectiveSalvation and Assurance:Christianity, especially in the Pauline and Johannine tradition, affirms that believers can be assured of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ (John 3:16, Ephesians 2:8-9). This stands in contrast with the ambiguity presented in Muhammad’s admission in the Qur’an and the hadith regarding the fate of his followers.Finality of Revelation:The Christian doctrine maintains that the fullness of God’s revelation and salvation is in Christ, who not only declares but guarantees eternal life (John 14:6, 1 John 5:11-13).From an Islamic PerspectiveDivine Sovereignty:Islam teaches that ultimate judgment belongs to Allah alone. Even prophets are not exempt from divine scrutiny, and ultimate knowledge of each soul’s destiny rests with God (Qur’an 31:34).Humility of Prophets:Muhammad’s statement is seen as a sign of prophetic humility and submission to Allah’s will.Academic SpectrumComparative Religion:Scholars recognize that both Islam and Christianity have traditions about division and “saved” communities, but they handle assurance of salvation differently. Where Christianity (especially Protestant traditions) leans toward assurance, Islam underscores the necessity of hope and fear, leaving final judgment to God.Sectarianism:Both religions experienced early and enduring divisions, yet both preserved canonical traditions emphasizing unity and orthodoxy.ConclusionThe statement in Qur’an 46:9 and the hadith about sectarian division invite deep theological reflection on authority, certainty, and salvation. While Islamic tradition sees these verses as emphasizing God’s ultimate authority and the necessity of following revelation, critical and Christian perspectives see in them a lack of assurance that only the Gospel of Christ fulfills.The crucial question remains:Which path truly leads to salvation and certainty in the life to come?For Christians, the answer is found in Christ alone, the only one who guarantees salvation and eternal life. For Muslims, hope is placed in God’s mercy, but the door remains open and uncertain.Shalom,Dr. Maxwell ShimbaServant of Jesus ChristShimba Theological Institute",

What or who is the source?Without wasting time, let's begin reading Muslim books.IF MUHAMMAD WAS BORN WITH SATAN, PLAYED WITH BY SATAN, WHY DO YOU FOLLOW HIM?HIS BIRTH,Abu Huraira (r.a) narrated that \"Prophet Muhammad (s.a.w) had Satan from the time he was born.\" (Fat'hul Baary Vol. 6 Pg. 389).From the proof we read above, we have learned that Muhammad was born with the power of demons, and that is a very bad beginning since we have no verse or hadith that says Muhammad was freed from these demons when he was given prophecy by a strange creature.Surprisingly, Muhammad was given prophecy by a strange creature that choked him until he struggled and saw stars. Read the proof below.AFTER LEAVING THE CAVE, MUHAMMAD CONFESSES THE FOLLOWING,So the Prophet was frightened, returned to his wife, told her, and immediately a high fever struck him. He wanted to be covered with clothes, trembling severely, and he was scared, saying, \"I fear for myself, being played with by demons, ruining my mind and deceiving me.\" (The Life of the Prophet Muhammad, pg. 17, written by Sheikh A. Farsy).You have read for yourself and understood that the act of Muhammad being choked until he struggled in this way surely did not come from the God of Adam, Abraham, Moses, and other Prophets of the Bible. There is not a single verse in the Holy Bible that says His prophets were choked by angels; instead, we read that all the prophets in the Bible were given prophethood by God Himself and not by a strange creature who gave Muhammad prophethood at night in a cave.MUHAMMAD BEING BEWITCHED,Aisha, the wife of the Prophet, said, \"A Jew named Labiid bin Al'answan bewitched the Prophet Muhammad, and sometimes the Prophet would become confused and start calling out aimlessly.\" (Sahih Muslim Vol. 4 Pg. 38-39)DOES IT MEAN THAT GOD COULD NOT FIND SOMEONE ELSE TO SEND EXCEPT MUHAMMAD WHO WAS PLAYED WITH BY DEMONS?THIS IS A GREAT TRAGEDY FOR MUSLIMS, BECAUSE NOW WE KNOW THAT MUHAMMAD WAS NOT ONLY BORN WITH DEMONS BUT WAS ALSO ADDED TO BY BEING BEWITCHED.Although there is no verse or hadith that says Muhammad was freed from demons, it is not wrong to acknowledge that Muhammad died with demons in his heart, and therefore his end is hellfire.The tragedy continued later, even the writer of the Quran was possessed by demons.My friends, why don't Muslims read their own books?DID THE WRITER OF THE QURAN HAVE A DEMON?READ:The first person to learn reading and writing in the city of Mecca was Mr. Harb bin Umayya, the grandfather of Mr. Muawiya. He learned from the people of Yemen and then taught those who wanted to learn in Mecca.When the Prophet received prophethood, there were only six people in Mecca who knew how to write. Four of them entered Islam and became the scribes of \"Wahyi\" (Quranic verses). These people were Sayyidna Abubakar, Sayyidna Umar, Sayyidna Uthman, and Sayyidna Ali. (The Life of the Prophet Muhammad, pg. 8, by Sheikh A. Farsy)SAYYIDNA ABUBAKAR,Abubakar said, \"Surely I have a demon that visits me from time to time, so whenever it comes to me, avoid me.\" (Tabaqatul Kubra, Vol. 3 Pg. 212)NOW, IF THE \"QURAN\" WAS WRITTEN BY A PERSON WHO HAD A DEMON, WHY SHOULD WE NOT ACCEPT THAT THESE ARE VERSES FROM SATAN?Dear reader, I urge you to be careful with Islam because there is nothing good there except demons everywhere. From Muhammad, the Quran, to their Allah, all have confirmed that Satan is in their hearts.So why follow Satan when the Great God exists and loves you?JESUS IS THE ONLY WAY TO SALVATION. ALLAH IS NOT THE WAY. MUHAMMAD IS NOT THE WAY. THE QURAN IS NOT THE WAY.Jesus is the only way to salvation because He alone can pay the penalty for our sins (Romans 6:23). No other religion teaches the depth and seriousness of sin and its consequences. No other religion pays the penalty for sin except Jesus alone. No other \"religious founder\" had God become human (John 1:1, 14) - the only way to pay the debt. Jesus had to be God so He could pay our debt. Jesus had to become human so He could die. Salvation is found through faith in Jesus Christ! “Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved” (Acts 4:12).Have you made a decision for Christ based on what you have read here?Make sure you understand the meaning of salvation.1 John 5:13 tells us, \"I have written these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know that you have eternal life.\" God wants us to understand the meaning of salvation. God wants us to have confidence in knowing for sure that we are saved. Let's briefly go over the key aspects of salvation:(a) We have all sinned. We have all done things that are displeasing to God (Romans 3:23).(b) Because of our sins, we deserve to be punished by being separated from God forever (Romans 6:23).(c) Jesus died on the cross for our sins (Romans 5:8; 2 Corinthians 5:21). Jesus died in our place, taking the punishment that we deserved. His resurrection proved that Jesus' death was sufficient to pay for our sins.(d) God offers forgiveness and salvation to all who believe in Jesus – trusting His death as the payment for our sins (John 3:16; Romans 5:1; Romans 8:1).Those are the details of salvation! If you have placed your faith in Jesus as your Savior, you are saved! All your sins are forgiven, and God promises never to leave you or forsake you (Romans 8:38; Matthew 28:20). Remember, your salvation is secure in Jesus Christ (John 10:28-29). If you believe in Jesus alone as your Savior, you can be confident that you will spend eternity with God in heaven!God bless you all,I am Dr. Max Shimba, a servant of Jesus Christ, the GREAT GODFor Max Shimba Ministries Org,MAX SHIMBA MINISTRIES ORG ©2016.

    "full_content": "Tuesday, November 29, 2016Muhammad’s Insult and Curse Against an Orphan: An Interfaith Perspective on Ethical SpeechIntroductionReligious texts and traditions play a pivotal role in shaping the moral and ethical outlook of their adherents. The teachings of both Islam and Christianity strongly emphasize compassion, kindness, and the sanctity of speech—particularly toward the vulnerable in society, such as orphans. However, historical and scriptural records sometimes reveal instances where even revered figures are portrayed in ways that challenge contemporary ethical expectations. One such instance is recorded in Islamic sources, where the Prophet Muhammad is said to have insulted and cursed an orphan child. This episode invites critical reflection not only on the figure of Muhammad but also on the ethical standards upheld by the world’s major religions.The Incident as Reported in Islamic TraditionTheSahih Muslimcollection, regarded as one of the most authoritative compilations of Hadith in Sunni Islam, records an event in which the Prophet Muhammad insulted and cursed an orphan who was in the care of Umm Sulaim, the mother of Anas ibn Malik (Sahih Muslim, Book 32, Hadith 6297). The implications of this narration are significant, given the high esteem in which orphans are generally held within the Qur’anic and Prophetic traditions, and the explicit warnings against mistreating them (Qur’an 93:9–10).The Universal Prohibition of Abusive SpeechIslamic PerspectiveIt is noteworthy that the ethical teachings of Islam strongly prohibit the use of abusive or insulting language. The Prophet Muhammad himself is reported to have stated:“Indeed, a true believer is neither a slanderer, nor one who curses others, nor is he indecent or foul-mouthed.”(Musnad Ahmad, Volume 1, Page 416, Hadith Number 3948)This hadith underscores the foundational Islamic virtue of speaking kindly and refraining from verbal abuse, cursing, or slander. The Qur’an itself commands believers to “speak to people good words” (Qur’an 2:83), and repeatedly extols those who restrain their anger and forgive others (Qur’an 3:134).Christian PerspectiveChristian ethics similarly maintain a high standard for speech and interpersonal conduct. The Apostle Paul, addressing the church in Ephesus, instructs:“Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, clamor, and evil speaking be put away from you, with all malice.”(Ephesians 4:31, NKJV)This call is echoed throughout the New Testament, as followers of Christ are admonished to build others up through their words (Ephesians 4:29) and to imitate the humility and gentleness of Christ himself (Philippians 2:5).The Consequences of Abusive Speech: Divine JudgmentBoth traditions warn of divine judgment for those who persist in abusive language and conduct.Islamic WarningsDespite the troubling hadith in Sahih Muslim, the wider corpus of Islamic teachings presents a consistent warning against cursing and slander. The Prophet Muhammad is often depicted as embodying patience and mercy, especially toward children and orphans. Muslims are instructed to follow these ethical standards, with the understanding that God is both Just and Merciful, and that “whoever does an atom’s weight of evil will see it” (Qur’an 99:8).Christian TeachingsThe Apostle Paul is unequivocal in his warnings regarding the eternal consequences of unrepentant sin, including verbal abuse:“Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers [abusive talkers], nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.”(1 Corinthians 6:9–10, ESV)This stern admonition underscores that verbal abuse—categorized here as “revilers” or those who insult—can disqualify a person from inheriting the Kingdom of God if not repented of.Ethical and Interfaith ReflectionsThe incident recorded in Sahih Muslim raises important questions about the application of religious teachings and the moral accountability of religious leaders. Both Islamic and Christian traditions agree: insults, curses, and abusive language are antithetical to authentic faith. The episode serves as a reminder for all believers to scrutinize their own speech, attitudes, and actions—especially towards the marginalized and vulnerable, such as orphans.In interfaith dialogue, these common ethical imperatives can serve as a foundation for mutual respect and moral accountability. As religious communities, we must uphold and promote the values of kindness, respect, and compassion in both word and deed.Conclusion and BenedictionLet us be reminded that knowledge is to be shared with respect and humility. The teachings of the great faith traditions converge on the principle that our words have the power to bless or to harm, to build up or to destroy. May we all strive to embody the highest ideals of our faiths, treating every human being with dignity and love.May God bless you all.Dr. Max Shimba,Servant of Jesus Christ, the Great God (cf.

    "full_content": "Tuesday, November 29, 2016Insults Among Muslims: A Sacred Ritual According to the Late Muhammad?An Academic and Theological CommentaryMax Shimba Ministries OrgIntroductionThis commentary seeks to address the phenomenon of verbal abuse and the use of insults within certain religious communities, focusing specifically on the Islamic tradition as referenced in hadith literature. The analysis draws upon both Islamic sources and Christian perspectives, with the aim of fostering an informed and respectful discussion on the matter. The commentary concludes with recommendations for a Christian response, grounded in the teachings of the Gospel.Insults in Islamic TraditionIt is not uncommon for Christians to encounter derogatory remarks or insults from some Muslims concerning matters of faith. To better understand this phenomenon, we turn to primary Islamic sources.Abu Huraira (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said:“Whoever is given to insulting others, indeed Satan has whispered into his mouth.”(Fat'hul Baari, Volume 10, Page 176)This narration clearly indicates that, within the Islamic tradition, the act of insulting others is regarded as the result of satanic influence. According to this hadith, those who insult others are viewed as being under the sway of Satan, who uses their mouths as instruments for his own purposes.Additional Islamic ReferencesFurther examination of Islamic sources reveals additional references to Satan's influence in the daily lives of believers. For example, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is reported to have said:“Satan comes to one of you during prayer and blows (whispers) into his posterior, causing the person to think that he has passed wind, even though he has not. In such a case, he should not leave his prayer unless he hears a sound or perceives an odor.”(Kitabu cha Mkweli Mwamiu, Volumes 1–2, Hadith No. 74, p. 42)This narration underscores the belief that Satan is not only involved in provoking insults but also actively seeks to distract and mislead believers during their acts of worship. There are additional mentions in Islamic tradition suggesting that Satan may reside in the nostrils of Muslims or otherwise seek to disturb their bodily functions during prayer.The Christian ResponseFrom a Christian theological standpoint, the occurrence of insults and verbal abuse—interpreted here as evidence of spiritual bondage—should not surprise believers. Instead, it is viewed as a call to respond with evangelistic zeal and intercessory concern. Christians are urged not to retaliate, but rather to persist in sharing the message of the Gospel (Injil) with those engaged in such behaviors, in the hope that they may awaken spiritually and become liberated from what is perceived as satanic influence.Thus, the Christian response is characterized not by animosity or surprise, but by a sense of mission and compassion. The ultimate aim is transformation—bringing those considered spiritually lost into the freedom and grace offered through the Gospel of Jesus Christ.Implications and Christian DutyIn light of the aforementioned Islamic references, this commentary concludes that Christians bear a significant responsibility to present the Gospel to Muslims, whom the author describes as being under spiritual bondage due to these influences. The hope expressed is that, through receiving the Gospel, such individuals may be delivered from negative spiritual influences and cease to be \"instruments\" or \"playthings\" of Satan.ConclusionWhile this reflection is admittedly polemical in its approach, its purpose is to highlight what are perceived as spiritual dynamics at play in certain interreligious encounters. The Christian is therefore encouraged to approach such situations not with hostility, but with a sense of spiritual mission, seeking the transformation and liberation of those believed to be lost, through the power of the Gospel.Author's NoteThe above is a scholarly translation and contextual arrangement of the original Swahili text.

They resort to insults because their mouths are filled with the words of Satan. Satan expands his rear and leaves flatulence in their mouths, making them insult without shame. This evidence is stated by Muhammad himself, the prophet of the Muslims.MUSLIMS HAVE BEEN INFLUENCED BY SATAN IN THEIR MOUTHS:Abu Huraira (r.a) narrated that: The Prophet (s.a.w) said, \"Anyone who insults, it is because Satan has influenced his mouth.\" (Fat'hul Baary Vol. 10, Pg. 176)Therefore, our fellow Muslims are under the influence of Satan. We should not be too surprised by this but rather continue to preach the Gospel to them, so they may awaken and stop being influenced by Satan in their mouths, as Satan has a strong hold on them. Besides influencing their mouths, Satan also settles in their nostrils.SATAN SLEEPS IN THE NOSTRILS OF MUSLIMS:Abu Huraira (r.a) narrated that the Prophet (s.a.w) said, “When one of you wakes up from sleep, let him wash his nose by putting water in it and then blowing it out three times, because Satan has spent the night in the upper part of his nose.” (Bukhari, Hadith No. 516, Vol. 4)BUT SATAN DOES NOT JUST INFLUENCE THEIR MOUTHS AND SLEEP IN THEIR NOSTRILS; he also enjoys playing games by blowing on the buttocks of Muslims.The Prophet (s.a.w) said, “Satan comes to one of you in prayer and blows on your buttocks, making you think that you have released wind when you did not. If you experience this, do not leave your prayer unless you hear a sound or smell something.” (THE BOOK OF SINCERE MUSLIMS, VOL. 1-2 HADITH NO. 74, PG. 42)Therefore, we Christians have a great responsibility to deliver the Gospel to these slaves of Satan, the Muslims, so they can stop being influenced by Satan in their mouths, stop being his beds, and stop being used as his playthings through their buttocks.MUHAMMAD INSULTS AND CURSES AN ORPHANProphet Muhammad insulted and cursed an orphan who was with Umm Sulaim (the mother of Anas). (Sahih Muslim, Book 032, Number 6297)SHARE KNOWLEDGE WITHOUT INSULTS!Remember, all religions prohibit insults!ISLAM:Muhammad said: \"A true believer does not accuse others, nor curse others, nor use vulgar language.\" {Musnadu Ahmad Vol. 1 Pg. 416, Hadith No. 3948}CHRISTIANITY:(Ephesians 4:31) - \"Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, clamor, and evil speaking be put away from you, with all malice.\"THERE IS JUDGMENT FOR THOSE WHO INSULT!(1 Corinthians 6:9-10) - \"Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor sodomites, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God.\"God bless you all.I am Dr. Max Shimba, a servant of Jesus Christ, the GREAT GODFor Max Shimba Ministries Org,MAX SHIMBA MINISTRIES ORG ©2016.

Immediately he began trembling violently, hallucinating and saying, ‘I fear for myself that Satan has played with me, destroyed my mind, and deceived me.’Lady Khadija immediately interrupted him and said: ‘Stop that; that is not what will happen. You cannot be played with by devils. Satan cannot play with a person who has your qualities. You take good care of your relatives, you carry the burdens of even people who are not yours, you show people your good traits which none possesses. You do this and you do that. Rejoice my dear; calm your heart. By Allah! I see that you have already become a prophet.’”In this incident that happened to Muhammad while he was in the cave, Muslims all over the world claim that this is the moment Muhammad (peace be upon him) receivedwahyi(revelation) and was given prophethood and apostleship.But when you reflect on this message, you will notice that even he himself did not know what had happened to him in the cave. That is why we read that when he arrived home, his wife Lady Khadija covered him with a cloth thinking he had a fever. Muhammad explained to his wife that what had happened to him was caused by “Satan”; he did not mention any angel as Muslims try to make us believe today.Because if it had been an angel—as we read in the Bible—the angel would not have hesitated to identify himself to Muhammad. This is the first point.In the end, Lady Khadija is the one whoappointedher husband Muhammad into prophethood.Today you have learned that Muhammad was given prophethood by his wife.It is I, Max Shimba, servant of Jesus Christwww.maxshimbaministries.orgOctober 29, 2016",

Islam does not allow people of other beliefs or religions to worship freely. This is why in Arab countries like Saudi Arabia, especially in Mecca, there is not a single church. Allah does not like freedom of worship.Surah At-Tawbah 9:29–“Fight those who do not believe in Allah nor in the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which has been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the religion of truth, from among the People of the Book, until they pay the jizyah with willing submission and feel themselves subdued.”Surah Al-Anfal 8:38–39–38. Say to the disbelievers: If they stop, all that has passed will be forgiven. But if they return (to disbelief), then the example of the former peoples has already passed.39. And fight them until there is no more fitnah (persecution or disbelief), and the religion is entirely for Allah. But if they cease, then surely Allah sees what they do.”Surah At-Tawbah 9:5–“When the sacred months have passed, then kill the polytheists wherever you find them, capture them, besiege them, and lie in wait for them in every ambush. But if they repent, establish prayer, and give zakat, then let them go their way. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.”Surah Al-Baqarah 2:193–“And fight them until there is no fitnah and the religion is for Allah alone. But if they cease, then there is to be no aggression except against the wrongdoers.”Surah Aal Imran 3:84–“Say: We believe in Allah and what has been revealed to us, and what was revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, and what Moses, Jesus, and the prophets received from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and to Him we submit.”Muhammad’s efforts to spread Islam peacefully failed completely. For 13 years Muhammad had only about 100 followers, most of whom were his own relatives and close family. After failing miserably to spread Islam using peaceful methods, Muhammad changed tactics and “revealed” the verses above—verses commanding that people be forced to join his religion, or else face severe consequences including death.He told his followers that Allah had commanded him to compel people to join his religion.In the final years of his life, before his death, Muhammad no longer cared whether or not people willingly joined Islam; he forced everyone to join by threatening them with death. This included his greatest enemy, Abu Sufyan, and his wife Hind.According to Islamic historians, Abu Sufyan went to Muhammad seeking peace after years of conflict, but Muhammad forced him to convert to Islam or else be killed. Muhammad’s exact words to him were:“Submit and testify that there is no god but Allah and Muhammad is His Messenger, or if you refuse, your head will be cut off.”(Read Ibn Ishaq/Hisham 814)Therefore Abu Sufyan agreed.The entire city of Mecca submitted by force when Muhammad invaded it with his army. Many refused but were forced into Islam; those who resisted were beheaded by Muhammad himself.Others were expelled from Mecca after the final pilgrimage, as recorded inQur’an 9:5.Christians and Jews in Arabia at that time suffered the same fate: Muhammad forced them either to convert to Islam or face death. Many were given only one option: convert to Islam or be expelled from their own lands.(ReadSahih Muslim 19:4366)Before his death, Muhammad sent his armies to force the pagan Arab tribes, such as the tribe of al-Harith, to accept Islam. He told them they had only one option—to join him or be killed by the sword. Fearing his threats, the tribe converted.Later, Muhammad cursed all Christians and Jews.ReadSahih Bukhari 8:427.According to Al-Shafi’i in“The Ordinances of the Quran,”Muhammad forced people to join him or he killed those who rejected him.SeeBukhari 53:386.Similarly, Abu Bakr, who succeeded Muhammad, launched even more violent jihads in neighboring lands against those who rejected Islam. In a letter sent to the Persians, Abu Bakr wrote:“Accept Islam and you will be free; but if you refuse, then know that I have come to you with an army that loves death as you love life.”These same characteristics of Muhammad can now be seen in Boko Haram, Al Qaeda, Al Shabab. Evidence of this culture is also present in ISIS, which has killed millions in Syria. Even in Africa, particularly in Nigeria, Boko Haram has been at the forefront of implementing Muhammad’s command to kill Christians. Muslims believe that doing this fulfills Allah’s desire and earns them paradise for forcing people to join Islam.SeeBukhari 52:254.Muhammad also forced Jews to payJIZYA, simply because they refused to convert to his religion. This was a method of hurting and oppressing the Jews so they might convert.See Bukhari and Ahmad (5114 or 4869 depending on commentary).One thing you must understand is this: in Islam, actions are more important than mere belief in Allah. Even today, in countries with large Muslim populations, they do not like the presence of other faiths or religions—examples include Saudi Arabia, Zanzibar, Somalia, etc.In the end, Abu Sufyan’s son Muawiyah overpowered and defeated Ali, Muhammad’s adopted son. He also poisoned Hassan, one of Muhammad’s beloved grandsons. Abu Sufyan’s grandson Yazid became Caliph and killed Muhammad’s grandson Hussein.This is Islam and the way it forces people to join it—unlike Christianity, which does not force anyone, but proclaims the message of Jesus. In Christianity, there is no compulsion as found in the Islam of Muhammad.Questions for reflectionWhat kind of god uses swords to force people to join him?What kind of god kills people and claims that is the way to paradise?Why is there no compulsion in the Bible?Why are there no apostles in Christianity who use swords and knives to force people to join, as in Islam?Why is the Christian God not filled with hatred like Allah of Islam?Today we have learned that Islam contains coercion, unlike Christianity. Furthermore, Allah is not Jehovah, the God of the Bible, because their actions are completely different. Therefore, it is not wrong to say that Adam, Abraham, David, Jesus, and all the prophets of the Bible were not Muslims and never worshiped Allah.God bless you greatly.Max Shimba, servant of Jesus ChristForMax Shimba Ministries Org.Such are the perils of forcing others to say that you are a prophet when they do not believe it to be true.",

His inheritance laws are spread out in several chapters such asAl-Baqarah,Al-Ma’idah, andAl-Anfal. But in more detail, they are set forth inSurat al-Nisā’.Surat al-Nisā’ 4:11“Allah instructs you concerning your children: for the male, a portion equal to that of two females. If there are more than two females, they shall receive two-thirds of what the deceased has left. But if there is only one female, she shall receive half. And for the parents, each of them shall receive a sixth of what he left if the deceased has a child. If he has no child and his parents are his only heirs, then his mother shall receive a third. But if he has siblings, then his mother shall receive a sixth. This is after any bequest that has been made or any debt has been paid. Your fathers and your children—you do not know which of them is more beneficial to you. This is an ordinance from Allah, and surely Allah is All-Knowing and All-Wise.”Surat al-Nisā’ 4:12“And your share is half of what your wives leave if they have no child. But if they have a child, then your share is a quarter of what they leave, after any bequest they may have made or debt they owed. And your wives shall receive a quarter of what you leave if you have no child. But if you have a child, then they shall receive an eighth of what you leave, after any bequest you may have made or debt you owe. And if a man or a woman whose inheritance is being distributed has no child nor parents, but has a brother or sister from the mother’s side, then each of them shall receive a sixth. But if they are more than that, they shall share in a third, after any bequest has been made or debt paid, without causing harm. This is a command from Allah, and Allah is All-Knowing and Most Forbearing.”Surat al-Nisā’ 4:176“They ask you for a ruling. Say: Allah gives you this ruling concerning a person who dies leaving no child: if he has a sister, she shall have half of what he leaves. And he shall inherit from her if she has no child. If there are two sisters, they shall have two-thirds of what he leaves. If there are brothers and sisters together, then the male shall receive a portion equal to that of two females. Allah clarifies this to you so that you do not go astray, and Allah is All-Knowing of all things.”Although Allah claims that he has clarified these laws plainly and without doubt, when you read these verses they are full of confusion and contradictions.Qur’an 4:11 says that if the child is a single daughter, her portion is half. But that same verse claims that the brother receives twice the portion of the sister. Mathematically, this means the brother takes everything. This is a mathematical disaster for Allah.Beyond that, when you include the mother and father in this inheritance system, Allah leaves them stranded, because the calculations become too difficult for him.That is why I ask:Who taught Allah mathematics or arithmetic?THIS IS A VERY GREAT DISASTER FOR MUSLIMS.",

The Qur’an also supposedly teaches the Big Bang theory that caused the creation of the world (Surah 21:30; 51:47–48).The Arabic wordfalakmeans “orbit.” Astronomers tell us that the sun revolves around the center of the galaxy once every 250 million years. The Arabic wordyasbahuna(fromsabaha) means “to swim,” but some Muslims claim it means “to rotate in its own course.”Response:This is daydreaming for two reasons:The words are not clear:Falakis an Arabic word that can mean path or flowing in a course, andyasbahunacan mean “to hurry,” even though its more straightforward meaning is “to swim.”Muhammad himself clearly told us what it means, and he meant that the sun and the moon travelabove the earth, moving across adome-like skyover the world.There aretwo primary Islamic sourcesthat record Muhammad’s explanation:“God created a sea three farsakhs (18 km) from heaven. The clouds are restrained, standing in the air by God’s command. None of its water falls. The seas do not move, but the sea moves with the speed of an arrow. It has the freedom to move in the air with equal measure, as if it were a stretched rope between east and west. The sun, the moon, and the returning stars [the five planets] run in the depths of its belly. This is what the word of God means: ‘Each one swims in its orbit.’ ‘The sky’ is the circle of chariots pulled by horses in the depths of that sea.”—Al-Tabari, vol. 1, p. 235.Abu Dharr narrated:“One evening the Prophet asked me, ‘Do you know where the sun goes when it sets?’ I replied, ‘Allah and His Messenger know best.’ He said, ‘It goes (that is, it travels) until it prostrates beneath the Throne, and it seeks permission to rise again, and it is permitted. But a time will come when it will want to prostrate but its prostration will not be accepted…’”—Bukhari, vol. 4, book 54, chapter 4, no. 441, p. 283; Sahih Muslim, vol. 1, book 1, chapter 73, no. 297–300, pp. 95–96(also gives a more detailed account).2. The Qur’an describes the sun’s axis near the center of our galaxyResponse:The sun doesnothave its own unique axis around the galaxy. If the Qur’an was truly teaching modern science, it would have said thatthe sun, moon, earth, and the retrograde planetsall rotate together around a single galactic center.Again, we know exactly what Muhammad meant, becausehe explained it, as recorded inBukhariandAl-Tabari(references above).3. The “resting place of the sun” supposedly refers to the sun shining on the other side of the earthResponse:No. We know exactly what Muhammad meant, because he explained it — and Bukhari and Al-Tabari recorded it. (References above)4. The “resting place of the sun” supposedly means the sun’s complete destructionResponse:Anyone reading this in any language can see the text refers tocycles, not literal destruction of the sun.5. Poetic language: The sun, moon, and planets simply mark out a path in the skySome argue these verses were not meant to endorse or deny modern science, but were simply poetic descriptions showing that Allah controls the objects people saw in the sky.Response:This argument might make senseif Bukhari and Al-Tabari had not recorded Muhammad’s detailed explanations.If Bukhari and Al-Tabari were wrong on this point, then what standard is there to claim they were right about anything else?**That is why I say Allah is not Yahweh, the Almighty Creator of all things.Allah has fabricated (distorted) the narrative of creation.**I am Max Shimba,A servant of Jesus Christ.October 26, 2016",

A wide open expanse can be compared to a carpet, with mountains as pegs.”ZUL-QARNAIN IN SURAH 18 AND ASTRONOMYSurah 18:85-86\"One (road) he followed, until, when he reached the setting of the sun,he found it setting in a spring of murky (black, muddy) water, and near it he found a people. We said: ‘O Zul-qarnain! You have the authority either to punish them or treat them kindly.’\"“Murky” is also translated as “black,” “muddy,” or “dirty.” Some translations say “a spring of water.” M. H. Shakir translated it as “a black sea.”Surah 18:89-90\"Then he followed another road, until he reached the rising place of the sun; he found it rising on a people for whom We had provided no shelter from it.\"Muslim commentators differ on the identity of Zul-qarnain (the man with two horns):Some say Alexander the GreatOthers say Cyrus of PersiaOthers say a king from YemenBut it does not matter. According to the Qur’an, Zul-qarnain literally traveled to the place where the sun rises and where it sets. This assumes aflat-earth cosmology.Most importantly, the Qur’an claims:He reached the place where the sunsets in a muddy spring.Ask any astronomer whether the sun sets in a muddy spring, and they will say:“No.”CONCLUSIONThe Qur’an teaches the following:The earth is flat, spread out like a carpet.Mountains act as pegs that fasten the earth down.The sun travels along its own track, sets in a muddy spring at night, and rises from a specific physical location in the morning.The heavens contain “hanging lamps” (stars).Muhammad taught early Muslims that these things were literal truths, not metaphors.Allah has failed to demonstrate that he created the earth—he cannot even describe its shape correctly.Therefore, Allah did not create the earth.By Max Shimba, servant of Jesus Christ",

    "full_content": "Dear reader:Some Muslims claim that the Quran contains scientific truths about the movements of the sun, moon, (and sometimes planets). I would like to examine this issue, and we will explore various aspects before drawing a conclusion. However, the fundamental point is: unless a Muslim interprets these verses metaphorically, these verses do not confirm or prove the scientific accuracy of the Quran.Surah 36:37-40 states, “And a sign for them is the night: We withdraw therefrom the day, and behold, they are plunged in darkness; 38 And the sun runs its course for a period determined for it; that is the decree of (Him), the Exalted in Might, the All-Knowing. 39 And the moon – We have measured for it mansions (to traverse) till it returns like the old (and withered) lower part of a date-stalk. 40 It is not permitted for the sun to catch up to the moon, nor can the night outstrip the day: each (just) swims along in (its own) orbit (according to law).” (Yusuf Ali’s translation, first edition) [Words in brackets are in the brackets in the translation.]Some Muslims say that “the sun runs its course for a period determined” and the word “orbit” is placed at the end. However, we cannot say much about the “orbit” of the sun because Yusuf Ali’s translation has a reference (note 17) at the bottom of the page related to this word saying “course, path.” Also, Yusuf Ali's revised edition says “resting place” instead of “period.”How Some Muslims Interpret the Quran Freely?The Sufi websitehttp://www.sufi.co.za/modern_science_and_islam.htmgoes to the extent of saying:\"All these objects, the earth, the moon, and all the planets at all times move in their orbits (or axes) in floating\" (Ansari).It adds the words \"(all these are planets)\" and \"(or their axes)\" in brackets, because they are not in the Arabic text. Let’s leave this as a misinterpretation and ask, \"What does Surah 36:37-40 really teach?\" It could be one of these three things:Orbits of the Sun and Moon: The Quran teaches that the sun and moon travel continuously on their orbits around the earth for a fixed period.Swimming to a Resting Place: The sun swims through the clouds during the day, heads to its resting place at night, and returns to its place where it was the previous morning. Similarly, the moon swims on its path.Metaphors: Like the previous part, but this is meant as a description of how things appear, not how they actually are.Let’s Go Back to the ArabicOrbit/Path: Yusuf Ali explains the Arabic word in question in reference 3983 at the bottom of page 1326. He says, “Mustaqarr may mean: (1) a period determined or a term appointed, as in vi. 67, or (2) a resting place or a place of repose; or (3) a dwelling place, as in ii. 36. I think the first meaning is the best here; but other commentators prefer the second. In that case, the comparison would be to the sun running a race while it appears to us, and resting during the night to prepare for the renewal of the race the next day. Its resting together with the other side of the world appears to us as a period of rest.”Moving/Swimming/Orbiting: yasbahuna can mean to hasten, although its more direct meaning is to swim.Swim/Orbit: Renowned Islamic commentator Ibn Taymiyyah (died in 1328 AD) wrote, “The sun, stars, and planets are round (istidaaratul-aflaak) – as is the statement of the astronomers and mathematicians (ahlul-hay’ah wal-hisab)..... [The word] falak [in Arabic] means something round” (Majmu’ul-Fatawa volume 6, pp. 566-567).It’s Not a “Scientific Miracle” That the Sun and Moon Are “Falak” Becausea) The word for ‘the earth revolving around the sun’ in Arabic is not falak but mahrek.b) The word falak did not originate in the Quran; it was a borrowed word from a foreign language.One person contributed the following: “The origin [of Arabic -- falaka] … from an ancient Semitic root we find [Akkadian -- pilakku]; [Hebrew -- pelek]; [Arabic -- falkatun], all meaning a rapidly moving circle, and another different origin [of Arabic -- falakun]; [Ethiopian -- falaka] meaning the other half of the sky. Therefore, etymologists have traditionally sought to relate [the Arabic word -- falkun] to this root, thinking that it was called so due to its circular shape.”Also, the word falak was used by the Arabs before Muhammad’s birth to mean the floating of the sun, stars, and planets on the “round celestial dome.” People living before and during Muhammad's time believed that the universe followed an Aristotelian/Ptolemaic model where the earth was at the center surrounded by seven circular domes (spheres). The sun, stars, and planets were believed to move in these circles, or the circles themselves were thought to move in a single path. Since the Quran mentions that there are seven heavens, it shows Muhammad’s view of the “astronomical system” resembled the Ptolemaic and Aristotelian model, which was believed to be true in that historical period.My Opinion (For Now):Although the Arabic word is not completely clear, these words do not describe anything that people before Muhammad’s birth had not already said.However, if we assume that Muhammad and his early followers did not understand the Quran (a safe assumption), and that the scientific views of the Quran are accurate, we have two ways to reach an appropriate conclusion. First, what did the early Muslims say about this, and second, what does the rest of the Quran say?What Did Muhammad and Early Muslims Say About the Sun?Where would you go to find the correct meaning of the Quran? Zamakhshari? al-Tabari? Baidawi? If you were an early Muslim, you could go to Muhammad himself! Hear how Muhammad explained, according to Bukhari and al-Tabari.\"Abu Dhar reported: The Prophet asked me at sunset, 'Do you know where the sun goes (at sunset)?' I replied, 'Allah and His Apostle know best.' He said, 'It goes (i.e., travels) till it prostrates itself underneath the Throne and takes the permission to rise again, and it is permitted and then (the time will come when) it will be about to prostrate itself but its prostration will not be accepted...' \"Bukhari volume 4 book 54 chapter 4 number 441 page 283.Another translation of the same Bukhari passage says: **\"Abu Dharr Ghifari (ra) narrated: Once Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) asked me, 'Abu Dharr do you know where the sun sets after setting?' I replied, 'I don't know, only Allah and His Prophet can tell better.' Then Prophet (SA) replied, 'After setting, the sun remains prostrated under the Aro’sh (Allah's throne) and waits for Allah's order to rise again in the east. The day will come when the sun will not be allowed to rise again and Qiyamah (the Day of Judgment) will come upon the earth.'\"**Al-Tabari volume 1 page 231 states, \"I asked the Messenger of God [Muhammad] 'Where does [the sun] set?' He replied: 'It sets in the heaven and then rises from heaven to heaven until it rises from the highest heaven, the seventh heaven. Finally, when it is beneath the Throne, it falls prostrate and the angels in charge of it prostrate with it. Then the sun says, My Lord, where do you command me to rise, where I set or where I rose? He continued. This is (meant by) the word of God: 'And the sun runs on to a resting place for him [this is] the decree of [Him] the Exalted in Might, the All-Knowing' while it is held under the Throne - 'that is the decree of the All-Mighty, the All-Knowing' - the Lord of his Kingdom, the Lord who 'knows' His creatures. He continued, Gabriel brings a garment from the Throne’s light to the sun according to the measure of hours and days. It is longer in summer and shorter in winter and of medium length in spring and fall. [The styles of spring, fall, and winter!] He continued, the sun wears this garment, as one of you wears his garment. Then it is free to circulate in the firmament of heaven until it rises from its rising place. ... The same way is followed by the moon during its rising ... But Gabriel brings the garment from the light of the feet. This is the meaning of the word of God, 'He made the sun a shining light and the moon a light.'\"The sun and the moon are Allah's signs.Abu Dawud volume 1 book 2 number 1173 page 304; Sunan Nasa’i volume 2 number 1462, 1464 page 272; volume 2 number 1465, 1466 page 273; volume 2 number 1475 page 278; volume 2 number 1477 page 280; volume 2 number 1481 page 283; volume 2 number 1485-1486 page 286-287; volume 2 number 1488-1489 page 287, 289; volume 2 number 1500 page 297; volume 2 number 1502 page 299; volume 2 number 1505 page 300; volume 2 number 1506 page 301.Dhu al-Qarnaiyn [Zul Qarnain] \"saw the sun setting in a spring of muddy water.\"al-Tabari volume 5 pages 173-174 (See Surah 18:82-97).Al-Tabari volume 1 page 234 also states that the sun sets in a spring of mud. The phrase \"muddy spring\" is hami’ah, meaning dark mud, but hamiyah is a similar word meaning hot.(See reference 442 below page 234).**\" [Muhammad] continued. When the sun rises, it rises on a chariot (drawn by horses) from one of those springs accompanied by 360 angels .... When God wishes to test the sun and moon, to show His servants a sign and thereby command them to stop disobeying Him and start obeying Him, the sun suddenly collapses from its chariot and falls into the depth of the sea, which is circular. When God wishes to increase the significance of the sign to terrify His servants more, the entire sun falls, and none of it remains in its chariot. This is a complete solar eclipse, during which the day turns to night and stars appear.\" al-Tabari volume 1 page 236.What Do Muhammad and Early Muslims Tell Us About the Heavens?The Prophet [Muhammad] said: ‘Ali, there are five stars: Jupiter (al-birjis), Saturn (zuhal), Mercury (utarid), Mars (Bahram), and Venus (al-zuhrah). These five stars rise and run like the sun and moon and compete with them. All other stars are suspended from the heavens like lamps hung in mosques...\"al-Tabari volume 1 pages 235-236.\"God created a sea three fasrakh (18 kilometers) from the heavens. The waves are controlled, standing in the air by God's command. Not a single drop spills. All seas do not move, but the sea runs with the speed of an arrow. It is left to travel in the air in equilibrium, as if it were a rope pulled in a region between east and west. The sun, moon, and stars revolve in the depth of the waves of the sea. This is what the word of God means: ‘Each one swims in a circle.’ ‘Circle’ is the course of the chariot drawn by horses in the depth of the sea.\"al-Tabari volume 1 page 235.Opinions of Early Muslims:The sun actually goes to a resting place at night, and the sun and moon \"swim\" actually in the sea of water in the sky.What Do Other Parts of the Quran Say?Understand that verse numbers vary in different editions of the Quran. The following verse numbers are from (the revised edition of) Yusuf ‘Ali. I have corrected the use of capital letters.Surah 20:53“He Who has made for you the earth like a carpet spread out”Surah 50:7“And the earth - We have spread it out4946, and set thereon mountains standing firm …”Yusuf Ali's note 4946 at the bottom of the page says, \"Compare xiii. 3; and xv. 19 and note 1955. The earth is round, but it looks flat like a vast expanse of land, like a carpet held firmly by the weight of the mountains.\" So whether you believe that this verse claims the earth is flat or not, Yusuf Ali says this verse states that the earth appears as a flat carpet.Surah 67:15“It is He who has made the earth manageable5571 for you...” Other translations use the word \"smooth.\" Yusuf Ali's note 5571 at the bottom of the page says, \"Zalul is used in ii.71 for a trained and manageable animal: here it is used to describe the earth, and I have translated it as ‘manageable’….”Surah 71:15“‘Do you not see how Allah has created the seven heavens one above another ‘And made the moon a light in their midst, and made the sun a lamp.’” Even if taken as metaphorical, there is nothing here suggesting modern astronomical teachings.Surah 71:19“‘And Allah has made the earth for you like a carpet (spread out),5718…” Yusuf Ali’s note 5718 at the bottom of the page says, \"compare xx 53.Surah 78:6-7“Have We [Allah] not made the earth as a wide expanse5890, and the mountains as pegs?” Yusuf Ali’s note 5890 at the bottom of the page says, \"See note 2038 to xvi. 15. Compare also xiii. 3 and xv. 19. A wide expanse like a carpet, on which mountains are placed as pegs ….\"Zul-Karnain in Surah 18 and AstronomySurah 18:85-86\"He [Zul-Qarnain] followed a path, until, when he reached the setting of the sun, he found it set in a spring of black muddy (or hot) water: near it he found a people: We [Allah] said: 'O Zul-Qarnain! (thou hast authority) either to punish them or to treat them with kindness.'\" The word \"murky\" is also translated as \"black water\" and \"muddy.\" The phrase \"spring of ... water\" is also translated as \"spring.\" M. H. Shakir translates it as \"black sea.\"Surah 18:89-90\"Then he [Zul-Qarnain] followed another path, until, when he came to the rising of the sun, he found it rising on a people for whom We had provided no shelter from the sun.\"Islamic commentators differ on who exactly Zul-Qarnain (the man with two horns) was. Some think he was Alexander the Great, others think he was Cyrus the Persian, and still others think he was a Yemeni king. However, it does not matter. Whatever the case, Zul-Qarnain was able to go to the actual place where the sun sets. This fact confirms the Quranic view that the earth has a flat shape. More importantly, he went to the place where the sun sets and found it setting in a muddy, murky spring.If you ask astronomers if the sun sets in a muddy spring, they will tell you \"no.\"Conclusion: The Quran teaches the following:The earth is flat, spread out like a carpet, and held down flat by pegs that are mountains.The earth has its own orbit set for a period during the day, then sets in a muddy, murky spring at night and goes to Allah’s throne.The sun later rises from a particular place.Except for the five retrograde planets, stars are hung like lamps.Muhammad taught the early Muslims this as literal truth, not as a metaphor or analogy.The Purpose of Stars and Meteors\"The lowest heaven is adorned with lamps [stars], and 'We have made such lamps as missiles to drive away the evil ones, and have prepared for them the punishment of the blazing Fire.'”Surah 67:5.\"The creation of these stars is for three purposes, namely, to adorn the sky, as missiles to hit the devils, and as signs to guide travelers. Therefore, if anyone tries to seek any other interpretation, he is mistaken and is wasting his efforts...\"Bukhari volume 4 book 54 chapter 3 before number 421 page 282.Sometimes meteors are thrown at devils who try to listen to heavenly secrets. Sahih Muslim volume 1 book 4 number 902 and note 674 below page 243.Meteors should strike the bad angels before they can spread what they heard. Ibn-i-Majah volume 1 book 1 number 194 page 110.Meteors attack jinn (genies) Sahih Muslim volume 4 book 24 number 5538 page 1210.Stars guard against the devil. al-Tabari volume 1, page 223.Muhammad Splits the Moon in Two\"The pagans requested the Prophet to show them a miracle, so he showed them the moon split into two halves.\"Bukhari volume 4 book 56 chapter 26 and number 831, page 533.\"Ibn 'Abbas reported: The moon was split into two halves during the lifetime of the Prophet.\"Bukhari volume 4 book 56 chapter 26 and number 832, page 534.The splitting of the moon. Bukhari volume 6 book 60 chapter 225 and number 290, page 273 and note 1 below page 273; volume 6 book 60 chapter 287 and number 387-391, pages 365-366; volume 6 book 60 chapter 261 and number 345, 349, page 331; Bukhari volume 6 book 60 chapter 265 and number 368-370, pages 331, 336.\"The splitting of the moon Sahih Muslim volume 4 book 37 number 6721, 6724-6730, pages 1467-1468.\"Surah 54:1 states, \"The Hour (of Judgment) is nigh, and the moon is cleft asunder.\"(revised edition of Yusuf ‘Ali).Note that the splitting into two means the moon was split in half, and the verb used here is in the past tense. We have no records of any other people in the world, including their neighbors in Egypt, Syria, or Persia, who saw the moon split in two. The Quran and hadith do not explain how the moon could return to one piece again.Yusuf ‘Ali, in reference note 5128 at the bottom of the page, says, \"Three explanations are offered in the Mufradat, and perhaps all three are applicable here: (1) that the moon appeared cleft asunder in the valley of Mecca in the presence of the Prophet, his Companions, and some Unbelievers; (2) that the past tense in Prophetic vision indicates the future, the cleaving asunder of the moon being a Sign of the coming Judgment; and (3) that the phrase is metaphorical, meaning that the matter has become plainly clear as the moon. The first cleaving was witnessed by the Unbelievers, as is evident from verse 2. The second cleaving will be the breaking up of the solar system at the New Creation: Compare lxxv. 8-9.\"Contradictory Examples in the Quran?Let's leave the previous verses and look at other verses in the Quran that some Muslims believe support modern astronomical principles. To be fair, here are the verses they use, along with their responses.Surah 7:54\"...He brings the night as a covering over the day, each seeking the other in rapid succession...\"Response: It is true that night and day follow each other, but this does not say anything about science or astronomy that the ancients did not already know.Surah 13:2a and Surah 31:10say that Allah raised the heavens without any pillars that you can see.\"Response: Although not all ancient people believed the heavens were held up by pillars, this simply states that God did not use any visible pillars.Surah 13:2b\"...And subjected the sun and the moon! Each one runs (its course) for a period appointed\"Response: That the sun and moon have regular courses was known even to ancient people.Surah 21:30\"Do not the Unbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were joined together (as one unit of Creation) before We [Allah] clove them asunder?\" Some Muslims see this as a foreshadowing of the Big Bang theory of creation.Response: The ancient Egyptians, Aryan Hindus, and others believed the heavens and the earth were joined together before being separated. Simply saying that the heavens and the earth were together (as halves) is akin to ancient myths and not the Big Bang theory of creation.Surah 21:33\"It is He who created the Night and the Day, and the sun and the moon: all (the celestial bodies) swim along, each in its rounded course.\" Yusuf Ali's note 2695 at the bottom of the page says, \"I have indicated, contrary to many Commentators, the metaphor of swimming implied in the original words...\"Response: The word for orbit in Arabic is not used here, and \"swimming\" does not necessarily suggest modern astronomical principles. The Quran mentions the sun and moon, not planets and stars, so it's incorrect to put (the sun, moon, stars, and planets) in brackets in the translation. The Quran does not say that anything moves in its own orbit in space except for the sun, moon, and the five retrograde planets (planets).Surah 21:104\"The Day that We roll up the heavens like a scroll rolled up for books (completed).\"Response: It's unclear how this is supposed to foreshadow modern astronomy, but Muhammad’s first wife understood that he heard the gospel from a Christian, and the Bible, in Revelation 6:14 and Isaiah 34:4, contains similar imagery. However, Christians generally do not attempt to align modern scientific principles with Revelation 6:14.Surah 22:65\"...He holds back the sky from falling upon the earth except by His leave...\" Yusuf Ali's note 2847 at the bottom of the page says the word samaa can mean (1) anything above, (2) the root, roof, (3) sky, heavens, (4) clouds or rain. He prefers the last meaning, though most authorities incline to interpret it as \"sky.\"Response: Therefore, while most authorities interpret the word to mean \"sky,\" it still aligns with the view of a flat earth. Thus, while we cannot definitively say this verse affirms a flat earth view, the unclear Arabic does not support the claim of modern scientific accuracy.Surah 25:61-62\"Blessed is He who placed the constellations in the heavens, and placed therein a Lamp and a Moon giving light. And it is He who made the night and the day to follow each other.\"Response: Calling the sun a lamp does not confirm modern scientific views. That night and day follow each other was known even to ancient people.Surah 27:88\"...the mountains that you see and think are firmly fixed will pass away like clouds...\"Response: The preceding verse mentions the final trumpet, so this context is about end times, not today.Surah 29:44says that the creation of the heavens and the earth is a sign for those who believe.Response: The creation of the heavens and the earth showing God's majesty is also taught in Psalm 8:1, 3, 5; Psalm 19:1-6. Muhammad knew about the Psalms (zubur) of David, so this is not new.Surah 31:29, Surah 35:13, Surah 36:37, and Surah 39:5all say that Allah merges the night into the day and the day into the night. They also say that the sun and moon each run their courses for a term appointed. Surah 55:5 also says that the sun and moon run on fixed courses.Response: Nothing here indicates modern astronomical knowledge. These were things even ancient people understood and observed. Simply stating truths already known to people does not confirm a book's scientific accuracy. However, repeating widely known facts does not establish that the Quran predicted modern scientific understanding.Surah 51:47,48\"With power and skill did We construct the Firmament: for it is We Who create the vastness of space.\" (Yusuf Ali). Other translations say \"as a canopy.\"Response: Simply saying that God spread out the heavens does not confirm the Big Bang theory. This concept is also mentioned in the Bible, Isaiah 42:5. But Christians do not use this to claim the Bible predicted the Big Bang theory.Surah 55:33mentions the bounds of the earth which humans and jinn (genies) cannot pass without permission.Response: The bounds of the earth do not provide modern geographic knowledge but may reflect mythical barriers or obstacles preventing travel to certain parts of the world. Similarly, the bounds of the heavens do not have much significance, except that Muhammad and Jewish traditions talk about seven heavens.Surah 71:15-16\"Do you not see how Allah created the seven heavens one above another, And made the moon a light in their midst, and made the sun a lamp?\" Some Muslims claim this means the seven layers of Earth's atmosphere (troposphere, stratosphere, etc.) are the seven heavens.Response: Apart from the similarity to Jewish traditions, calling the moon a light and the sun a lamp does not indicate modern scientific understanding. Additionally, if the seven heavens are the seven layers of the Earth's atmosphere, it would be incorrect to say the sun, moon, and stars are in the heavens.As an additional thought, although the Bible does not mention seven heavens, several Jewish traditions related to the Bible but not part of the canonical scriptures (Apocrypha) mention seven heavens: 2 Enoch 20:1; Martyrdom and Ascension of Isaiah 7:8; 9:1,6; 10:17; The Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs chapter 3.3. And 3 Baruch 11:1 mentions five heavens, though it does not say they are the only ones. So, even if it were a scientific miracle that Muhammad mentioned seven heavens, it would be an even greater miracle that older books also mentioned seven heavens.Surah 86:1-3\"By the sky and the Night-Comer; And what will explain to you what the Night-Comer is? It is the star of piercing brightness. (Just as Allah Almighty controls every star in their flock, in the same way) there is a guardian angel over every soul.\" (Malik)Some Muslims claim this teaches that the sun is a star.Response: Notice two things: a) the sun is not mentioned here, and b) all words in parentheses are additions in the English translation; they are not in the original Arabic text!Yusuf Ali's (revised) translation is more accurate here. \"By the sky6067 and the Night-Comer6068 (therein); And what will explain to you what the Night-Comer is? - (It is) the star of piercing brightness; - There is no soul but has a guardian over it.6069\"Yusuf Ali's note 606 at the bottom of the page says, \"…‘The star of piercing brightness’ is understood by some to be the planet Saturn, by others to be Sirius, or Pleids [Pleiades] or meteors. I think it is best to understand ‘Star’ in the general sense, as stars shine every night in the year, and their piercing brightness is more noticeable in a dark night.\"Some Interpretations Are Contrary to This World!Here are other Islamic interpretations recorded athttp://debate.org.uk/topics/history/interprt.htm. This site also has other good information.\"For instance, Muhammad Hanafi al-Banna discovered references to airplanes (Surah 17:1), artificial satellites (Surah 41:53), interplanetary travel (Surah 55:33), and the hydrogen bomb (Surah 74:33-38) (Jansen 1980:48).Thus, it was not surprising when people like Muhammad Kamil Daww wrote that the miracle of the 'scientific' statements in the Quran was greater than the miracle of inimitable eloquence. This demonstrated the truthfulness of Muhammad and, hence, the correctness of all statements in the Quran.Today, the most well-known person propagating the scientific interpretation is the French doctor Maurice Bucaille. In his book, \"The Bible, The Qur'an and Science,\" he tried to show how the Bible is unscientific while elevating the Quran using the same criterion.\"But Some Muslims Were More ReasonableIt is worth noting that some Muslims do not believe these interpretations. Some see these verses as merely describing what can be easily observed in the sky.Muhammad said: \"Refrain from speaking about me except for things that you know. Anyone who deliberately fabricates lies about me should prepare their place in hellfire. And anyone who interprets the Quran according to their own opinion should prepare their place in hellfire.\"Tirmiz EE, Tefsir 1, (2951) (contributed).\"Yes, We cast the truth against falsehood, and it destroys its brain, and behold, falsehood perishes! Ah! Woe to you for the (false) things you ascribe (to Us).\"Surah 21:19.If anyone deliberately fabricates lies about Muhammad, their place will be in hellfire.Abu Dawud volume 3 chapter 1372 book 19 number 3643, page 1036. Also Bukhari volume 2 book 23 chapter 33 number 378, pages 212-213.\"...And whoever says anything deliberately false against me [Muhammad], certainly their place will be in the (hell) Fire.\"Bukhari volume 8 book 73 chapter 109 number 217, pages 139-140.False testimony is equal to claiming that Allah has partners.Ibn-i-Majah volume 3 book 13 number 2372, page 414.Opinions of Muslims and Their ResponsesThe Quran anticipated modern science: The sun and the moon are in orbits and rotate on their axis (Surah 21:33; 36:27-40). The Quran also teaches the Big Bang theory of creation (Surah 21:30; Surah 51:47,48). The Arabic word falak means \"orbit.\" Astronomers tell us that the sun orbits around the center of our galaxy approximately every 250 million years. The Arabic word yasbahuna (derived from sabaha) means to revolve in its orbit.1Response: These are wishful interpretations for two reasons.The words are not clear: falak is an Arabic word meaning path, to continue on its course, and yasbahuna can mean to hasten, though its direct meaning is to swim.Muhammad clearly told us what it meant, and it means the sun and moon travel over the earth, riding a chariot in the sky.Again, there are two sources of what Muhammad said.\"God created a sea three fasrakh (18 kilometers) from the heavens. The waves are controlled, standing in the air by God's command. Not a single drop spills. All seas do not move, but the sea runs with the speed of an arrow. It is left to travel in the air in equilibrium, as if it were a rope pulled in a region between east and west. The sun, moon, and stars revolve in the depth of the waves of the sea. This is what the word of God means: ‘Each one swims in a circle.’ ‘Circle’ is the course of the chariot drawn by horses in the depth of the sea.\"al-Tabari volume 1 page 235.Abu Dhar reported: The Prophet asked me at sunset, 'Do you know where the sun goes (at sunset)?' I replied, 'Allah and His Apostle know best.' He said, 'It goes (i.e., travels) till it prostrates itself underneath the Throne and takes the permission to rise again, and it is permitted and then (the time will come when) it will be about to prostrate itself but its prostration will not be accepted...’”Bukhari volume 4 book 54 chapter 4 number 441 page 283. Sahih Muslim volume 1 book 1 chapter 73 numbers 297-300 pages 95-96 also provides detailed accounts of Muhammad’s conversation with Abu Dharr.The Quran describes the orbit of the sun near the center of our galaxy2Response: The sun does not have its own orbit in our galaxy. If the Quran was trying to teach modern science, it should have said that the sun, moon, earth, and retrograde stars (planets) revolve together in one orbit.Again, we know exactly what Muhammad meant because he told us, as recorded in Bukhari volume 4 book 54 chapter 4 number 441 page 283 and al-Tabari volume 1 page 235.The resting place of the sun means it shines on the other side of the earthAgain, we know exactly what Muhammad meant because he told us as recorded in Bukhari volume 4 book 54 chapter 4 number 441 page 283 and al-Tabari volume 1 page 235.The resting place of the sun means the complete destruction of the sun4Response: Any ordinary person reading this in any language would think it refers to periodic cycles, not complete destruction.Metaphorical language: The sun, moon, and stars are used as signs. These verses were not meant to support or deny modern science but were poetic descriptions, merely saying that Allah was involved with things that people could see.5Response: This view might be reasonable if it weren’t for the words Bukhari and al-Tabari wrote Muhammad said. If Bukhari and al-Tabari were wrong about this, then what criteria can we use to say they were right about anything?ConclusionSome Muslims (not all) attempt to use these verses to prove the scientific accuracy of the Quran. Unless you can find fault with this analysis, it would be intellectually dishonest to try to claim that this proves the scientific accuracy of the Quran. The truth is that some of these verses contradict what we know through modern science, perhaps unless you interpret them as poetic and metaphorical language. However, Bukhari and al-Tabari show that these verses were understood literally. The sun and moon swim in the sky over the earth.However, the most important thing in the world is not what you know but Who you know. What matters is not people’s theories but whether you follow what the true God has revealed. Every astronomical view until the nineteenth century had errors. Who is to say that in the future people will not say the same thing about our scientific view? The only way we can know the truth is through what God has revealed to us. We hope that God will reveal to us what we need to know and that He will preserve the meaning of His revelation.Bibliography: Translations of the QuranArberry, Arthur J. The Koran Interpreted.

    "full_content": "Chapter X: The Mawlid of Prophet Muhammad – Pagan Origins and Historical ExaminationIntroductionThe celebration of the Mawlid of Prophet Muhammad has become widespread among many Muslims. However, a critical examination of Islamic sources raises important questions:Which verse of the Qur’an commands Muslims to hold the festival of Mawlid?Whom do Muslims truly follow—Allah, the Qur’an, the authentic Hadith, the Prophet Muhammad, the Pillars of Islam, or Sharia?This chapter explores the history, scholarly views, and religious implications of celebrating Mawlid, demonstrating that its origins are not rooted in the Qur’an or the practices of the Prophet and his companions, but rather in later historical innovations.1. Historical Background of Mawlid1.1 Early Islamic PracticeA careful examination of Islamic history shows three key points:Neither the Prophet Muhammad (may Allah bless him and grant him peace) nor his companions (may Allah be pleased with them) celebrated Mawlid.Mawlid was introduced over three centuries after the Prophet’s passing.Its founders were associated with non-Islamic practices and lineages.Al-Haafidh as-Sakhawi emphasizes:“The practice of celebrating the noble Mawlid was not accepted by the early righteous generations (Salafus Salih) of the first three centuries. Indeed, this matter was innovated afterward.”(Subulul Hudaa war-Rashaad, Vol. 1, p. 439)^11.2 The Emergence of Mawlid under the FatimidsAccording to Sunni scholar Al-Imam al-Maqrizi:“During the rule of the Fatimids in Egypt, these celebrations were treated as festive seasons where rulers would distribute wealth and generosity. They observed various festivals, including the Prophet’s Mawlid, the Mawlid of Ali, Hasan, Husayn, Fatimah, and other leaders.”(Al-Khutwat, Vol. 1, p. 490)^2The Fatimids, a Shia Ismaili dynasty, institutionalized these celebrations to legitimize their political and religious authority. They compelled people to light lanterns and observe festivities, particularly during Rabi’ul Awwal. Mawlid was officially observed as a custom rather than a divinely mandated practice.1.3 Scholarly Commentary on the FatimidsHistorical records describe the Fatimids (Banu Ubayd) as rulers who claimed lineage from Fatimah, though this was disputed by scholars. Imam Shamah notes:“The Fatimid rulers falsely claimed noble descent, oppressed people, and allied with foreign invaders. They introduced corrupt practices under the guise of religious celebration, including the Mawlid, to consolidate power and promote innovation over authentic Islamic practices.”(Ar-Rawdatayn, pp. 200–202)^3Abdullah Saleh Farsy writes:“Those who started Mawlid were Shia Ismailis. They ruled Sunni lands from 297 A.H. (909 CE) to 567 A.H. (1171 CE). When they left, Sunnis continued the Mawlid of the Prophet alone, discarding other celebratory innovations.”^4The first official Sunni Mawlid was organized byKing Mudhaffar al-Din, brother-in-law of Salahuddin Ayyubi, in the 12th–13th century.2. Absence of Qur’anic or Hadith EvidenceThe exact birth date of the Prophet Muhammad is not mentioned in the Qur’an or in any authentic Hadith. Scholars have only speculated:Safi-ur-Rahman al-Mubarakpuri (Ar-Raheeq al-Makhtum, p. 62) estimates the Prophet’s birth as Monday, 9 Rabi’ul Awwal, in the Year of the Elephant (571 CE)^5.Sirajur Rahman suggests the date corresponds approximately to late February or early March 571 CE (Al-Mustafa, 1993, p. 11)^6.Thus, the Mawlid cannot be derived from any Qur’anic directive or prophetic instruction; it is a post-hoc historical innovation.3. Scholarly Opinions on Mawlid as Bid‘ah (Innovation)Many Islamic scholars have condemned the Mawlid as an illegitimate innovation (bid‘ah):Imam Ash-Shatibi (Al-I’tisam, 1/34) lists Mawlid among condemned innovations^7.Imam Al-Fakihani denounces it in his treatise on bid‘ah^8.Imam Al-Hajj Al-Maliki calls it bid‘ah inAl-Mudkhal(2:11–12)^9.Abu at-Tayyib Shamsul-Haq Al-Adhwiym Abaadiy and his teacher Bashirud-Din Qanuji declare it forbidden, citing authentic Hadith^10.Abu ‘Abdillah Al-Haffaar Al-Maalikiy confirms that neither the Prophet nor his companions performed Mawlid, and it was never part of early Islamic practice^11.4. Questions for ReflectionWhere in the Qur’an are Muslims permitted to celebrate the Prophet’s Mawlid?Where in the Qur’an does it state that Muhammad was born and lived?Why do Muslims celebrate the Mawlid, which is not mentioned in the Qur’an?Muslims, whom do you truly follow—Allah, the Qur’an, the authentic Hadith, the Pillars, or Sharia?ConclusionThe celebration of the Prophet Muhammad’s Mawlid is apagan innovationthat emerged centuries after his passing. It was introduced for political and social purposes by the Fatimid rulers and is not rooted in authentic Islamic teachings. Understanding the historical and religious context of Mawlid invites Muslims to reflect on the importance of following Allah, the Qur’an, and the Sunnah of the Prophet, rather than cultural or political innovations introduced centuries later.Max Shimba Ministries Org.October 16, 2016FootnotesAl-Haafidh as-Sakhawi,Subulul Hudaa war-Rashaad, Vol. 1, p. 439.Al-Imam al-Maqrizi,Al-Khutwat, Vol. 1, p. 490.Imam Shamah,Ar-Rawdatayn Fiy Akhbaar Dawlatayn, pp. 200–202.Shaykh Abdullah Saleh Farsy,Tafsir Mawlid Barzanji, Zanzibar, p. iv.Safi-ur-Rahman al-Mubarakpuri,Ar-Raheeq al-Makhtum, p. 62.Sirajur Rahman,Al-Mustafa, 1993, p. 11.Imam Ash-Shatibi,Al-I’tisam, 1/34.Imam Al-Fakihani,Risaalah Maalooma.Imam Al-Hajj Al-Maliki,Al-Mudkhal, Vol. 2, pp. 11–12.Bashirud-Din Qanuji,Ghaayatul Kalaam fi Ibtwaal ‘Amal al-Mawlid wal-Qiyaam.Abu ‘Abdillah Al-Haffaar Al-Maalikiy,Al-Mi’yaar Al-Mu’arab, 7/99.BibliographyAl-Haafidh as-Sakhawi,Subulul Hudaa war-Rashaad, Vol. 1.Al-Imam al-Maqrizi,Al-Khutwat, Vol. 1.Imam Shamah,Ar-Rawdatayn Fiy Akhbaar Dawlatayn.Shaykh Abdullah Saleh Farsy,Tafsir Mawlid Barzanji, Zanzibar.Safi-ur-Rahman al-Mubarakpuri,Ar-Raheeq al-Makhtum.Sirajur Rahman,Al-Mustafa, Ansaar Muslim Youth Organisation, 1993.Imam Ash-Shatibi,Al-I’tisam.Imam Al-Fakihani,Risaalah Maalooma.Imam Al-Hajj Al-Maliki,Al-Mudkhal.Bashirud-Din Qanuji,Ghaayatul Kalaam fi Ibtwaal ‘Amal al-Mawlid wal-Qiyaam.Abu ‘Abdillah Al-Haffaar Al-Maalikiy,Al-Mi’yaar Al-Mu’arab.",

    "full_content": "Sunday, October 16, 2016A GREAT CONTRADICTION AND CONFUSION IN THE QURAN ABOUT MOSES ACCUSING AARON AND THE SAMARITAN OF MAKING THE GOLDEN CALFDear Reader,Let us turn to Surah Taha, which was revealed in Mecca, verses 92 to 95:92. (Moses) said: O Aaron! What prevented you, when you saw them going astray,93. That you did not follow me? Have you disobeyed my command?94. He said: O son of my mother! Do not seize me by my beard or my head. I was afraid that you would say: You have caused division among the Children of Israel, and you did not wait for my word.95. (Moses) said: O Samaritan! What do you want?The verses above state that Moses rebuked Aaron and “the Samaritan” for making the Golden Calf for the Israelites when Moses was on Mount Sinai. But is this claim true?LET US EXAMINE THE HISTORICAL EVIDENCEThe Assyrians conquered the Jews of the Northern Kingdom in 722 BC (Before Christ). They took them into exile and brought with them captives from various other kingdoms. These foreigners later intermarried with the remaining Jews from the lower tribes who were allowed by the Assyrians to remain in the land.Their children were the ones called“Samaritans”because they lived in the land of Samaria, which was named after the landowner known as“Shemer.”(See 1 Kings 16:24.)1 Kings 16:24–“He bought the hill of Samaria from Shemer for two talents of silver and built a city on the hill, calling it Samaria, after Shemer, the name of the former owner of the hill.”The Jews despised the Samaritans for two reasons:Because of their mixed blood (“mixed race”)Because they established their own temples in opposition to the Temple in Jerusalem.THE CONFUSION AND CONTRADICTION BEGINS HEREThe incident of the Golden Calf, which occurred near Mount Sinai as described in the Quran (Surah 20:92–95 above), took place in1446 BC, which is725 years before the first Samaritan was born in 721 BC.My brothers and sisters,Once again we see how the Quran is filled with confusion and contradiction at every turn.In the Quranic verses cited above, and when compared to the historical record of the Samaritans, there is a massive discrepancy between the time Samaritans first appeared and the actual event of the Golden Calf.The Golden Calf incident occurred in1446 BC, which is725 years before the first Samaritan was ever born, yet Allah claims there were Samaritans during that event.Why is Allah unable to present His dates accurately?QUESTIONSWhy did Allah fail to tell the truth about the Golden Calf incident and insist that it happened during the time when Samaritans existed?Is it possible that Muhammad’s lack of knowledge caused him to misunderstand what Gabriel was telling him?Is it possible that when Allah gave the message to Gabriel, Gabriel also failed to convey it to Muhammad correctly?Can we trust the Quran—which fails to present accurate historical data—as a book “with no doubt in it”?The history of the Golden Calf is found not only in religious texts but also in secular historical writings. But in the Quran, this account is presented with a major falsehood.If truly Allah is the one who gave the Torah to Moses, why did He fail to state the truth?If truly Allah gave the Torah to Moses, can Muslims and Allah show us where that original Torah revealedbefore the Quranexists today?Dear readers,The Quran was not revealed by Allah—it was written by people here on earth. If Muslims disagree, let them explain why Allah is unable to state the truth and instead fills the Quran with contradictions.Indeed, the foundation of the Islamic religion is a god who has already been described as thefather of lies. Return to these words from the Bible, the book of God:John 8:44– *“You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father’s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there...The Bible has already answered that the father of lies is the Devil, and he speaks what belongs to him. Therefore, that is why the Allah of the Muslims also speaks what is his.I invite you to the Great God, who is not the father of lies but is the Creator of everything and who died for your sins.Receive Jesus today and obtain Eternal Life.God bless you greatly.Max Shimba Ministries Org.MAX SHIMBA MINISTRIES ORG ©2015.

I will present two verses from the Bible and then two verses from the Quran, followed by a question.WHEN DID THE FLOOD OCCUR ACCORDING TO THE BIBLE?Genesis 7:6\"Noah was six hundred years old when the floodwaters were on the earth.\"The Bible, which is claimed not to be from God, states that Noah was six hundred (600) years old when the flood occurred. It also explains the years of Noah after the flood.Genesis 9:28\"And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.\"HOW OLD WAS NOAH WHEN HE DIED?Genesis 9:29\"So all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years; and he died.\"We are told by the Bible that Noah lived three hundred and fifty (350) years after the flood, and he died at the age of nine hundred and fifty (950) years. This is the total number of years Noah lived. Now let's turn to the Quran and then ask a question.WHEN DID THE FLOOD OCCUR ACCORDING TO THE QURAN?Quran 29:14-1514. \"And indeed We sent Noah to his people, and he stayed among them a thousand years less fifty years; so the flood overtook them while they were wrongdoers.\"15. \"But We saved him and the companions of the ship, and We made it a sign for the worlds.\"THE COMPLETE DISCUSSION:The Bible says that the flood occurred when Noah was 600 years old. The Quran says that the flood occurred when Noah was 950 years old, which corresponds to the age at which Noah died according to the Bible. The Bible says that Noah lived 350 years after the flood and died at the age of 950 years, which matches the age at which the flood occurred according to the Quran.QUESTIONS:According to the Quran, Noah was 950 years old when the flood came, while the Bible says he was 600 years old when the flood came and died at the age of 950. How many years did Noah live after the flood according to the 950 years mentioned at the time of the flood in the Quran?Or did he die in the same year of the flood, being 950 years old as stated in the Quran at the time of the flood?Note:Answers should be based solely on the Quran, the book claimed to be from God. If it is not self-sufficient, please state so, and I will allow you to use even newspapers and magazines.For Max Shimba Ministries Org.",

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteThursday, September 29, 2016ALLAH REVEALS A VERSE CLAIMING THAT HE DWELLS IN MAKKAH AND NOT IN HEAVENAccording to the Qur’an, Allah acknowledges and confesses that the true God is above—dwelling in heaven. However, in order to divert the Muslims, he commands them to direct their faces toward the place wherehe himselfresides—namely, Makkah.What Does It Mean to Swear an Oath?To swear, to take an oath, or to make a solemn vow means to affirm something by invoking the Name of Almighty God, especially when the matter being sworn by lacks clear or visible evidence. The one who swears declares that the statement is as true and reliable as claimed, and therefore the hearer is expected to believe it—because the ultimate guarantor of the oath is God Himself, the only One who knows the truth or falsehood of what is hidden in the human heart.A Qur’anic Verse That Demonstrates That Allah Lives in Makkah and Not in HeavenThe following passage establishes, according to the Qur’an, that Allah resides in the city of Makkah:Surat al-Balad (Qur’an 90:1–2)translated by Sheikh Ali Muhsin Al-Barwani:“I swear by this City!”“And you are a dweller of this City.”(Source: quranitukufu.net/090.html)QUESTIONS:Why does Muhammad swear by the city of Makkah?Who is the one dwelling in the city of Makkah by whom Muhammad is swearing?The Qur’an indicates that Muhammad is swearing by Allah—the one who dwells in Makkah.After Allah “revealed” a verse claiming that He dwells in Makkah, Muhammad further emphasizes this idea in the hadith by prohibiting Muslims from looking toward heaven during prayer. Instead, he requires them to direct their faces toward Allah’s earthly dwelling.BULUGH AL-MARĀMHadith 194 – Narrated by Jabir ibn Samurah:“The Messenger of Allah said: People who raise their eyes toward the sky while in prayer must stop, otherwise their sight will not return to them.”Yet, According to the Qur’an (Surat al-Mulk 67:17), Revealed in Makkah, We Read:“Do you feel secure from Him who is in heaven…?”Contrast With the BibleThe Bible consistently affirms that the true God is above in heaven:John 11:41“So they removed the stone. Then Jesus raised His eyes upward and said, ‘Father, I thank You that You have heard Me.’”The true and living God is above—in heaven.

He was put to death in the body but made alive in the spirit. 19 After being made alive, he went and made proclamation to the imprisoned spirits.\"The Word of God says thatHis body was put to death, but His spirit was made alive. Therefore, we need not be surprised, because we understand that it was onlyHis bodythat died, butHis spirit did not die.Scripture teaches us thatGOD IS SPIRIT; hence, the one who was killed was only thebody, butHis spirit remained alive.1 Timothy 6:15–16\"Which God will bring about in his own time—God, the blessed and only Ruler, the King of kings and Lord of lords, who alone is immortal and who lives in unapproachable light, whom no one has seen or can see. To him be honor and might forever. Amen.\"The divine nature of Goddid not changewhen the “WORD” became flesh (John 1:1, 14). Instead, theWord united with humanity(Colossians 2:9). Therefore, thedivinity of Jesus Christ was neither corrupted nor changed. Moreover, Jesus was not just a man who had God within him or merely someone doing the work of God—absolutely not. Jesus isGod in the fleshand thesecond person of the Holy Trinity.The Bible tells us inHebrews 1:3:\"The Son is the radiance of God’s glory and the exact representation of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful word. After he had provided purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty in heaven.\"Therefore, thetwo natures of Jesus Christcannot beconfused or mixed(Eutychianism), nor can they bemerged into one single nature(Monophysitism). Thesetwo naturesare distinct and independent, and yet at the same time, they are united in the person of Jesus. This union is known as theHypostatic Union.FURTHER EVIDENCE OF THE TWO NATURES OF JESUSThe doctrine of theHypostatic Unioninvolves what theologians call thecommunicatio idiomatum(Latin for \"communication of properties\"). This doctrine teaches that thedivine and human attributesof Jesus are both fully present in theperson of Jesus Christ. This means thatthe human Jesushad the right to say,“He had glory with God the Father before the world began” (John 17:5),He claimed to have come from Heaven (John 3:13),And that He is present everywhere—omnipresent(Matthew 28:20).All of these claims aredivine attributes, and Jesus fully possessed them.One of the greatest mistakesnon-Christiansmake is failing to understand thatJesus had two natures. For instance, theJehovah’s Witnessesview Jesus only as ahuman being, denying His divine attributes. They often focus only on the verses that describe the humanity of Jesus while rejecting those that testify to His deity.On the other hand,Christian Scientistsmake the opposite mistake: they emphasize Jesus’ divinity andneglectHis humanity.There are many other verses thattestify to the deity of Jesus, including:John 10:30–33John 20:28Colossians 2:9Philippians 2:5–8Hebrews 1:6–82 Peter 1:1To understand Jesus properly, every teaching about Himmust address bothHis divine and human natures.These two natures are essential to who He is.That’s why inLuke 2:52, it says:\"And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.\"Yet, at the same time, He wasomniscient(all-knowing), as seen inJohn 21:17.Jesus is the Word of God who became flesh/human(John 1:1, 14).God bless you all.It is I,Dr. Maxwell Shimba,Servant of Jesus ChristFor Max Shimba Ministries OrgMAX SHIMBA MINISTRIES ORG ©2016.

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Servant of Jesus ChristDate:Monday, September 26, 2016Abstract:This article presents a biblical argument affirming that Jesus Christ is the ultimate and final Judge of all humanity. According to Scripture, Jesus will judge not only Christians but also Muslims, their prophet Muhammad, the jinn (supernatural beings in Islamic theology), and even Allah – who, from a Christian theological perspective, is not the true God. The message is a clarion call to all people, especially Muslims, to acknowledge Jesus Christ as Lord and Judge and to submit to His authority before the day of judgment.Introduction:One of the most critical questions of eschatology is:Who will judge the world?The Bible provides a clear and unambiguous answer:Jesus Christ is the appointed Judge of all humanity. This includes every man, woman, and spiritual being — Muslims, Muhammad, all jinns, and any being presumed divine by human traditions, including Allah as portrayed in Islamic theology.Biblical Evidence:Psalm 58:11“Then people will say, ‘Surely the righteous still are rewarded; surely there is a God who judges the earth.’”This passage affirms that God actively judges the earth, pointing toward divine justice through a personal Judge.Revelation 18:8“Therefore in one day her plagues will overtake her: death, mourning and famine. She will be consumed by fire, for mighty is the Lord God who judges her.”This verse confirms that judgment will come suddenly by the hand of the Lord who has been given authority to judge.John 5:22“Moreover, the Father judges no one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son.”Jesus Himself affirms that God the Father has delegated all judgment to Him, the Son — removing all ambiguity about who the final Judge will be.Matthew 25:31–32“When the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the angels with Him, He will sit on His glorious throne. All the nations will be gathered before Him, and He will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.”This passage reveals that Jesus, referred to as the “Son of Man,” will preside as Judge over all nations and people.Acts 10:42“He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that He is the one whom God appointed as judge of the living and the dead.”The Apostle Peter testifies to Jesus’ divine appointment as Judge over both the living and the dead.Romans 2:16“This will take place on the day when God judges people’s secrets through Jesus Christ, as my gospel declares.”The apostle Paul teaches that all human secrets will be judged through Jesus Christ, not any other deity or prophet.2 Timothy 4:1“In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and the dead, and in view of His appearing and His kingdom, I give you this charge.”Paul again affirms Jesus Christ’s role in judging all humanity.Conclusion:According to the consistent witness of Scripture,Jesus Christ alone is the appointed Judge of all creation— not Muhammad, not any prophet, not the jinn, and certainly not Allah as defined in Islamic doctrine. The Judge is Jesus, the Son of God, to whom all power and authority in heaven and on earth have been given.Therefore, the question to every reader, especially to Muslims, is:Why not accept Jesus now, before the Day of Judgment arrives?The one who will judge your soul is not Muhammad nor Allah — it isJesus Christ.Come to Jesus TodayHe is not just a prophet — He is your Savior, Lord, and Judge.Sincerely,Dr. Maxwell ShimbaServant of Jesus ChristShimba Theological Institute",

    "full_content": "Saturday, September 24, 2016ALLAH REVEALED A VERSE AND MADE IT CLEAR THAT SYNAGOGUES ARE NOT MOSQUESThis is a shocking matter and a major blow to Islam worldwide. That is why I state openly that this is the final nail in the coffin of Islam.InSurah Al-Hajj, verse 40, the Qur’an itself clearly speaks about different types of places of worship. It lists “monasteries,” “churches,” “synagogues,” and “mosques.” The fundamental and thought-provoking question is this:If synagogues are truly the same as mosques, why does the Qur’an distinguish them by name and present them as separate institutions?The verse states:“Those who have been expelled from their homes unjustly only because they said, ‘Our Lord is Allah.’ And had Allah not repelled some people by means of others, monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques—wherein the name of Allah is mentioned abundantly—would surely have been destroyed. And Allah will surely support those who support Him. Indeed, Allah is Powerful, Exalted.” (Surah Al-Hajj: 40)Reflect carefully on these words:Monasteries– These are places where Christian monks withdrew for prayer and worship.Churches– Buildings set apart specifically for Christians to worship God.Synagogues– Jewish places of worship where the Torah was read and the name of the God of Israel was proclaimed.Mosques– Places where Muslims gather for their worship.Why does the Qur’an not combine all these as one, if indeed they all represent worship of the same God? If synagogues and mosques were the same thing, then this listing would be mere repetition, which would even damage the eloquence of the text.This reveals two major facts:First, the Qur’an openly acknowledges that before Muhammad, there already existed multiple distinct places of worship—Jews and Christians had known God and worshiped Him for many centuries through synagogues and churches.Second, this verse clearly shows that mosques are a new institution that emerged only after Muhammad. This eliminates the Muslim claim that Islam existed since the time of Prophet Abraham or that all previous religions were “Islam.” If that were the case, synagogues would have been called mosques, and churches would also have been recognized as mosques.Therefore, the Qur’an contradicts itself. In trying to legitimize the position of Islam, it inadvertently admits that earlier religions—Judaism and Christianity—had their own genuine and distinct identities of worship.This truth confirms my central argument:Islam is a system established by Muhammad in the 7th century AD and did not exist before him. It is a fabricated religion full of internal confusion, created to oppose and imitate the teachings of the Bible.Therefore, the question for every Muslim reader is this:Why does your Qur’an distinguish between synagogues and mosques?If your religion is truly the original and true religion, why does the Qur’an clearly state that synagogues and churches already existed, where the name of God was mentioned abundantly?Why does Allah honor Jews and Christians by mentioning their houses of worship, if their religions are truly “corrupted”?When viewed with realism, these arguments completely dismantle the foundation of Islam.That is why I,Max Shimba, a servant of Jesus Christ, boldly declare:There is no other name given to mankind by which we must be saved, except the name of Jesus Christ.(Acts 4:12)ConclusionQur’anic verseSurah Al-Hajj 40reveals a weighty truth that cannot be concealed: that the religion of Islam had no roots prior to Muhammad. The Qur’an itself openly acknowledges that before the birth of Islam, there already existed communities who served God through their own houses of worship—Synagoguesfor the Jews andChurchesfor Christians. By stating this, the Qur’an affirms that knowledge of God did not originate in the seventh century, but began thousands of years earlier through the Old Covenant and was fulfilled in Christ through the New Covenant.From a philosophical standpoint, this raises difficult questions for Islam:If the true religion is only one, why does the Qur’an list synagogues, churches, and mosques as distinct buildings?If Islam existed since the time of Abraham, why were synagogues and churches not called mosques?Why does the Qur’an honor Jewish and Christian houses of worship when Muslims are often taught that these religions have been corrupted?Historically, synagogues existed centuries before Christ, emerging especially after the Babylonian exile. They became centers where Jews gathered to read the Torah and invoke the name of the God of Israel. Likewise, Christian churches arose after the resurrection of Jesus Christ, spreading the Gospel and teachings of love and salvation. Therefore, when the Qur’an counts these buildings as places where the name of God is frequently mentioned, it directly acknowledges that Judaism and Christianity possessed legitimacy and spiritual authority long before Islam.Scripturally, the Bible had already declared centuries before Muhammad that salvation is found only through Jesus Christ. The Apostle Peter proclaimed clearly:“Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved.” (Acts 4:12)Thus, when the Qur’an attempts to validate mosques as places of worship to God, it contradicts itself by recognizing that synagogues and churches are also places where God’s name is proclaimed. This confirms that the true God had already revealed Himself through Jewish history and the incarnation of Jesus Christ, not through the later teachings of Muhammad.From a spiritual perspective, this should compel every Muslim to reflect deeply: Is your religion truly from God, or is it a later system constructed to imitate what already existed? Can salvation truly be found in a religion filled with internal inconsistencies, or in Jesus Christ, who declared Himself to be the way, the truth, and the life? (John 14:6)The truth remains unchanged:Islam is a later religion, founded by Muhammad, and it has no authentic roots in the history of salvation. The true path—established in the Old Covenant and fulfilled in the New Covenant—is Jesus Christ alone.Therefore, dear reader, the choice lies before you. You may continue holding onto a man-made religion, or you may choose to follow Jesus Christ, the light of the world and the Savior of your soul.I amMax Shimba, a servant of Jesus Christ.",

    "full_content": "Thursday, September 22, 2016This is one of the common questions asked by followers of Muhammad to Christians—and today I will provide the answer here.This question would only make sense if asked about a mere creature. For instance, if we said a certain man died, it would then be reasonable to ask, “While he was dead, who was taking care of his family?” That’s because such a question applies to human limitations—since a human being cannot be in more than one place at the same time.BUT GOD IS NOT A MAN! HE IS ALL-POWERFUL—ESPECIALLY THE GOD OF ABRAHAM, ISAAC, AND JACOB!First:This question is itself proof that the Allah worshipped by Muslims is not the Almighty God and lacks divine attributes. But before I offer the full answer, let me ask Muslims a question:HOW DOES ALLAH RUN THE WORLD IF HE HAS NEVER BEEN HERE ON EARTH?One attribute of God, which Allah lacks, isbeing present everywhere at once (omnipresence). This omnipresence is a divine attribute belonging to God alone. So, when Muslims ask how Jesus managed to run the world after dying, they expose their misunderstanding of God’s nature. Jesus Himself answers this in the Gospel of Matthew as follows:Matthew 18:20says:“For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I with them.”The attribute of being present everywhere at the same time is uniquely divine, yet Jesus claims it as His own. As seen in the verse above, wherever two or three gather in His name, He is present with them—regardless of where they are in the world. Whether they’re in Johannesburg, Cape Town, or Texas—Jesus is there. That’s the beauty of Jesus—He is God!Let’s continue to see what Scripture says about this inPsalm 139:Psalm 139:7–107 Where can I go from your Spirit? Where can I flee from your presence?8 If I go up to the heavens, you are there; if I make my bed in the depths, you are there.9 If I rise on the wings of the dawn, if I settle on the far side of the sea,10 even there your hand will guide me, your right hand will hold me fast.Here we see King David acknowledging that God is everywhere—you cannot escape His presence. It’s shameful that a Muslim would ask, “If Jesus died, who was managing the world?” Honestly, how can a rational person ask such a childish, earthly question? How can one compare God's capacity with that of a fragile human being? This is why I often sayAllah cannot possibly be the Almighty God, because his followers lack a divine understanding of what it means for God to be present everywhere.NOW, let me ask Muslims again: HOW DOES ALLAH MANAGE THE WORLD IF HE HAS NEVER BEEN ON EARTH?Answer me using scripture—not insults.Today, I’ve briefly explained thatJesus is omnipresent—He is present everywhere, regardless of your country or location. If you call upon Him, He answers and helps. To understand Jesus better, read the articlehttp://www.maxshimbaministries.org/…/asilia-mbili-ya-yesu-k…for further insights. Jesus isnot just a prophetas Muslims claim;He is far more—He is God!See more: http://www.maxshimbaministries.org/…/uthibitisho-10-kuwa-ye…When Jesus died, or when He was outside the human body,He was still God, becauseGod is Spirit and does not die. What died was the human body—not the Spirit, which continued to work. That’s why Jesus said, “Where two or three are gathered in my name, I am there.”But you’ll still find Muslims asking absurd questions like, “If Jesus is God, when He died, who was watching over the world?”Again, this question only makes sense when talking about a creature. If a human being dies, it’s reasonable to ask who is now taking care of his family. That’s because we’re talking about human limitations—but God is not bound by those limitations.HE IS GOD—HE CAN DO ALL THINGS—ESPECIALLY THE GOD OF ABRAHAM, ISAAC, AND JACOB!JESUS IS GOD—NOW AND FOREVER!HALLELUJAH!Reflect.

Therefore, Jehovah created male and female, and Allah swears by Him. Now you decide: who is truly God?Can God swear by another being? Keep learning…Hebrews 6:13“When God made His promise to Abraham, since He had no one greater by whom to swear, He swore by Himself.”Jehovah declares that there is no one greater than Himself by whom He could swear. Yet Allah in the Qur’an swears by the One who created male and female.Thus, today we understand thatthe Creator is Jehovah, and Allah swears by Jehovah, the God of the Bible and of Christians.Therefore,Allah is not the Almighty God.God bless you richly,Max Shimba© Max Shimba Ministries 2013",

    "full_content": "A Critical Theological and Historical AnalysisBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThe claim that Islam predates Muhammad and has been the original faith since Adam is central to Islamic theology. Islamic orthodoxy posits a universalist view: all prophets were Muslims, all past revelations are part of the continuum of Islam, and thus, Islam is as old as humanity itself.1Yet, this claim merits rigorous examination against the backdrop of ancient textual evidence, religious self-identification, and historical consciousness.This paper critically examines whether Islam, as a religious identity and doctrinal system, existed before Muhammad. Special emphasis is placed on primary sources, historical method, and direct engagement with major Islamic apologetic arguments.The Islamic Universalist ClaimThe Core AssertionMuslim theologians assert that \"Islam\" is not limited to the system established by Muhammad, but is instead the primordial faith of all genuine prophets and their followers.2The Quran itself declares:\"Indeed, the religion in the sight of Allah is Islam.\"(Quran 3:19)And regarding Abraham:\"He was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but a true Muslim (hanifan musliman), and was not of the polytheists.\"(Quran 3:67)Based on such verses, Muslims believe that Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, and Jesus all preached \"Islam\" and were \"Muslims.\"3Apologetic ArgumentIslamic apologeticsoften claims:The message of submission (Islam) is universal and found in earlier revelations.Practices such as ritual purity, prostration, and fasting are evidence of continuity between Islam and previous faiths.The Torah and Gospel were originally Islamic, though later corrupted.Methodological FrameworkCriteria for AnalysisPrimary Sources: Only documents demonstrably written before Muhammad (i.e., before the 7th century CE) will be considered.Terminological Evidence: Explicit use of \"Islam\" (الإسلام) or \"Muslim\" (مسلم) as religious identity.Doctrinal Substance: Beyond practices, doctrinal and theological content must reflect Islam as later defined.1. Textual Silence on \"Islam\" and \"Muslim\" Prior to MuhammadA. Hebrew Bible / Old TestamentNowhere in the Hebrew Bible do we find the term \"Islam\" or \"Muslim.\" Abraham is called the \"friend of God\" (Isaiah 41:8), a recipient of the covenant (Genesis 17), and the progenitor of Israel—not a \"Muslim.\" The central theme is covenant, not submission.4Even in post-exilic literature (e.g., Daniel, Ezra), the concept of \"Islam\" as later articulated is absent.B. New TestamentJesus and his followers never identify as \"Muslims\" or claim to follow a religion called \"Islam.\" Early Christians referred to themselves as members of \"the Way\" (Acts 9:2; 19:9, 23), and later as \"Christians\" (Acts 11:26). Paul explicitly refers to himself as a \"servant of Christ Jesus\" (Romans 1:1), not as a \"Muslim.\"5C. Second Temple and Greco-Roman LiteratureNo usage of \"Islam\" or \"Muslim\" is found in the Dead Sea Scrolls, Philo of Alexandria, Josephus, or any pre-Islamic Arabian inscriptions.6Jewish and Christian sects of the period—Essenes, Pharisees, Sadducees, Nazarenes, Ebionites—had well-defined self-identities, none of which included the terms or concepts later associated with Islam.2. The Argument from Shared PracticesIslamic apologetics often points to shared ritual practices—ablution, prostration, fasting—as evidence of pre-Islamic Islam. However, this argument is fundamentally flawed:Ablution: Ritual washing is central to Levitical law (see Leviticus 15), as well as to ancient Egyptian and Zoroastrian practice.7It does not define a religious identity.Prostration: Prostration is an ancient gesture of worship seen in Daniel 6:10 (Jewish), Matthew 26:39 (Christian), and in Hindu and Buddhist traditions.Fasting: Fasting predates Islam by centuries and is prominent in Judaism (Leviticus 16:29-31; Esther 4:16) and Christianity (Matthew 6:16-18).These practices are not unique to Islam, nor do they imply Islamic self-identity. Religious universals cannot serve as evidence for a specific faith.3. Doctrinal and Theological DistinctionsA. JudaismThe center of Jewish theology iscovenant(ברית,berit) and Torah obedience, not universal submission.8God is known as Yahweh, not Allah; the Shema (Deuteronomy 6:4) is the core confession, not the Shahada.B. ChristianityChristian faith revolves around theincarnation, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christand thenew covenant(Luke 22:20). Early Christians confessed \"Jesus is Lord\" (Romans 10:9), not \"there is no god but Allah, Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.\"C. IslamIslam, as established by Muhammad, is defined by the Five Pillars, the Quran, and the Sunnah. The doctrine oftawhid(absolute monotheism) and the prophethood of Muhammad are non-negotiable tenets unknown to previous revelations.94. Historical and Archaeological EvidenceNo archaeological inscription, manuscript, or papyrus prior to the 7th century contains reference to \"Islam\" as a religious system or to its followers as \"Muslims.\"10Pre-Islamic Arabia: Inscriptions reference gods like Hubal, Al-Lat, Al-Uzza, and Manat—not Allah in a monotheistic Islamic sense.11Christian and Jewish Writings: Non-Islamic sources do not recognize Islam or Muslims prior to Muhammad.5. Islamic Apologetics: Critical EngagementA. Retrojection and ReinterpretationIslamic polemics often retroject later concepts into ancient texts. For instance, calling Abraham a \"Muslim\" or claiming \"Islam\" means generic submission. However, historical-critical scholarship rejects such anachronisms, as self-identity in ancient texts is contextually bound.12B. Alleged Corruption of Previous ScripturesMuslim apologists assert that Jews and Christians corrupted their scriptures, hence the absence of explicit references to Islam.13However, textual criticism and manuscript evidence (Dead Sea Scrolls, Codex Sinaiticus, etc.) demonstrate remarkable fidelity in the transmission of biblical texts long before the advent of Islam.14There is no textual gap where \"Islam\" was erased or altered.C. \"Hanif\" and Primordial MonotheismThe termhanifin the Quran refers to pre-Islamic monotheists, often linked to Abraham. Yet, outside the Quran, there is no evidence that such a community called itself \"Muslim\" or that their faith matched Islam doctrinally or ritually.156. Summary Table: Key Figures and Self-IdentityFigureSelf-DesignationFaith/PracticePre-Islamic SourceAdamMan, created beingCovenant, not \"Islam\"Genesis 1–5AbrahamHebrew, Friend of GodCovenant, circumcisionGenesis 12–25MosesProphet of YahwehTorah obedienceExodus–DeuteronomyDavidKing, PsalmistCovenant, worship of YahwehSamuel, PsalmsJesusMessiah, Son of GodGospel, love, new covenantGospels, PaulNone referred to their faith as \"Islam\" or themselves as \"Muslim\" by any credible pre-Islamic text.ConclusionThe proposition that Islam, as a religious identity, existed prior to Muhammad is not supported by historical, textual, or archaeological evidence. All available sources point to Islam as adistinct, post-7th-century religious phenomenon.No use of the term \"Islam\" or \"Muslim\"in any pre-Islamic scripture.Shared ritualsare universal, not uniquely Islamic.Doctrinal substanceof pre-Muhammad faiths is distinct from later Islamic teaching.It is, therefore, both academically and theologically sound to affirm thatIslam is a man-made religion that began with Muhammad, not a timeless faith existing since Adam.To argue otherwise is to engage in retrospective reinterpretation, unsupported by the historical record.References and FootnotesFor Max Shimba Ministries OrgSeptember 02, 2016Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIf you wish to include an annotated bibliography or interact further with Islamic polemical responses (for example, in dialogue form or debate context), let me know!FootnotesSee: Seyyed Hossein Nasr,Islam: Religion, History, and Civilization(HarperOne, 2003), pp. 17–19.↩W.

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba | Max Shimba Ministries Org ©2016Friday, September 2, 2016The Islamic prohibition on eating pork is often emphasized as a sign of religious piety. However, there exists a theological contradiction in that Muslims permit the consumption of camel meat and even camel urine and milk, despite these being explicitly prohibited in the Torah.The Torah’s Prohibition on the CamelInLeviticus 11:4, which outlines the dietary laws given by Yahweh (Jehovah) to Moses, the camel is classified as an unclean animal:“Nevertheless, among those that chew the cud or have divided hooves you are not to eat the camel, because it chews the cud but does not have a divided hoof; it is unclean for you.” (Leviticus 11:4)This biblical directive clearly declares the camel to be unclean and thus forbidden for consumption. If, as Islam claims, Allah is the same God who revealed the Torah to Moses, then why does Islam contradict this divine command by allowing Muslims to consume camel products?Contradictions in Islamic PracticeMuslims often highlight the prohibition of pork as a sign of religious purity. Yet, many consume animals such as camels, lizards, and hyenas—some of which are also considered unclean or detestable in Jewish law. The consumption of camel meat, in particular, contradicts the Torah.Further compounding this theological issue is the Islamic allowance—encouraged even by the Prophet Muhammad—for drinking camel urine and milk. Such practices would be considered an abomination according to the Torah’s purity laws.Hadith Evidence Supporting the Use of Camel Urine and MilkAccording to authentic hadiths, Muhammad permitted and even prescribed the drinking of camel milk and urine for medicinal purposes:Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 7, Book 71, Numbers 589 & 590 (pp. 398–399)Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 7, Book 71, Number 623 (p. 418)Ibn Majah, Volume 5, Book 31, Number 3503 (p. 38):\"Indeed, in the urine of camels there is healing.\"Sunan al-Nasa’i, Volume 1, Hadiths 308–309 (pp. 255–256)Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 52, Number 261 (p. 162)In one incident, Muhammad instructed a group of individuals to follow his camel herder and drink from the camels’ milk and urine as a cure. When some of them later rebelled and killed the herder, Muhammad ordered their hands and feet be cut off and their eyes gouged out—punishments that raise further ethical and theological questions.Scholarly Critique and Theological QuestionsThis raises an important question: if the Torah, believed by both Jews and Christians to be divinely inspired, prohibits the consumption of camels, how can Islam, which claims continuity with previous revelations, justify such a practice? If Muhammad and Allah permit what God once declared unclean, are they not violating the eternal law revealed to Moses?This is not a small matter. It calls into question the consistency and integrity of the Islamic claim to be a continuation of the Abrahamic tradition. It also raises significant doubts about the compatibility between the revelations of Moses and those attributed to Muhammad.ConclusionIn conclusion, the consumption of camel meat, urine, and milk—endorsed in Islam and by Muhammad himself—stands in direct opposition to the commandments in Leviticus. This contradiction exposes a major theological rift between the Judeo-Christian scriptures and Islamic teachings.We invite every seeker of truth to come to the living Jesus Christ—our eternal high priest and savior—who fulfills, not abolishes, the law of Moses.May God bless you all.In His Service,Dr. Maxwell ShimbaMax Shimba Ministries Org ©2016.

    "full_content": "Friday, August 26, 2016MUHAMMAD IS DEAD BUT JESUS IS ALIVEJesus left the tomb!Jesus is alive today, but Prophet Muhammad has been dead for a long time!There is a great difference between Muhammad and Jesus. Muhammad died, but Jesus is alive today! He lives forever and ever.Prophet Muhammad was born around the year 570 in the city of Makkah and died at about the age of 62 on June 8, 632 in the city of Madina, now in Saudi Arabia. His grave is also there.Prophet Muhammad therefore died and was buried, and his remains are still in the grave today.Jesus was born four years before our era, and He died on the cross at about the age of 30 in Jerusalem. His body was placed in a tomb, but it is not possible to remember where it is now, because God raised Him from the dead after three days! Forty days later God took Him up into heaven where He sits at the right hand of God on the throne.Jesus is alive today and will never die again! That is the difference between Muhammad and Jesus. Muhammad died, but Jesus is alive today! He lives forever and ever.“When I saw Him (Jesus), I fell at His feet as though dead. But He laid His right hand on me and said, ‘Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last. I am the Living One; I was dead, and behold, I am alive forever and ever! And I hold the keys of death and Hades.’”(Revelation 1:17–18).Jesus says here that He is the First and the Last. Therefore no one will come after Him. So the Islamic claim that Muhammad is the last prophet is wrong, because no one can come after Jesus. Jesus is the Beginning and the End. He is completely unique!**Jesus / ChristianityMuhammad / Islam**Jesus had prophecies about Him, about 300 prophecies.Muhammad was not predicted by any prophecy.Jesus’ birth was miraculous, as even the Qur’an acknowledges.Muhammad was born like any other person.In Hebrews 4:15 it says that Jesus was “tempted in every way, just as we are—yet without sin.” Jesus was therefore without sin.Muhammad was sinful like all other people. He lied, deceived people, betrayed his own word, and lived in sexual immorality. Many times he was about to lose his followers because of his bad lifestyle. Nowhere in the Qur’an does it say that Muhammad was without sin.Jesus performed miracles, which were also acknowledged by the Jews who opposed Him (though they claimed His miracles came from Satan and not from God). The signs and wonders that accompanied Jesus show that He was who He claimed to be.Muhammad performed no miracles, something he repeatedly tried to explain away in the Qur’an. The only “miracle” he claimed was receiving the Qur’an—that is, he claimed it was revelation. But nothing supports this except his own words.Jesus was God.Muhammad was an ordinary man.Jesus lived out His teachings. By His own life, He demonstrated that His teachings worked. He did not only speak of love, He also lived love.Muhammad taught and preached, but he did not live what he taught.Jesus did not commit evil acts.Muhammad killed and also stole from people. He killed personal enemies. He raided caravans and carried out attacks on various Bedouin tribes, from which he took war booty.Jesus never used violence to persuade others of His teachings.“If anyone chooses to do God’s will, he will find out whether my teaching comes from God,”He says, for example, in John 7:17.Muhammad often used violence to force people to become Muslims. Even the Qur’an speaks about using violence against unbelievers.Jesus taught His disciples about love and truth. Nowhere in the Gospels does He tell His followers to harm, kill, or steal from anyone.Muhammad taught his followers to kill and steal in his name.Jesus was pure in thought, word, and deed.Muhammad had twenty wives and concubines, the youngest of whom was nine years old.Jesus died for the sins of the people.Muhammad died in and for his own sins, like any human being.Jesus died for us.Muhammad killed others for his own benefit.Jesus predicted His own death and resurrection.Muhammad died suddenly and unexpectedly, without in any way preparing his followers at the time of his death.Jesus rose from the dead. This is recorded many times in the Bible. Paul says, for example, in 1 Corinthians 15:6,“After that He appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep.”Muhammad did not rise, but his decaying body is still in his grave. Though there are lies claiming Muhammad ascended to heaven, these are of very late origin. Neither the Qur’an nor the earliest Islamic traditions mention any such thing.Jesus never contradicted Himself.Muhammad constantly contradicted himself. At times the Jews were the worst people, and at other times they were the best above all others. In the so-called “Satanic Verses,” which are now removed from the Qur’an (these are the verses for which Muslims cursed Salman Rushdie to death for blasphemy), it is said that Muhammad should also worship the three daughters of Allah. He then retracted this and became even more hostile toward Christians who claim that God has a Son.The Bible consists of 66 books, written by 40 different authors over several thousand years. These writers came from all levels of society—from kings like David and Solomon to Amos, who was an ordinary shepherd. Although these books were produced during very different periods of time, and under completely different cultural and social circumstances, the message of the Bible is a single, clear thread. The character of God, and what is right and wrong, is clear. In the 66 books there are many prophecies, many of which have already been fulfilled. As mentioned earlier, there are 300 prophecies about Jesus which were fulfilled in detail in His life. There are also prophecies about Israel and surrounding nations such as Assyria, Babylon, Persia, etc., which were fulfilled precisely. All this is strong evidence that the origin of the Bible is divine. The book says,“…men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit”(2 Peter 1:21). Without the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, it is impossible to understand how the various books of the Bible, whose histories are so far apart, could fit together like puzzle pieces into one whole.The Qur’an was written by one man throughout his life. It contains no specific prophecies that can be verified. It claims to confirm the Bible, but instead rejects the Bible in important areas.www.maxshimbaministries.org",

Does this Allah have the authority to forgive all sins?The Quran repeatedly states that those who die in their sins can never be forgiven by Allah, even though Muslims still have the tradition of praying for the dead so that Allah may receive the soul of the deceased.Surat Al-Mu’minun 101:“Then when the Trumpet is blown, there will be no kinship among them on that Day, nor will they ask one another.”102:“Those whose scales are heavy, they are the successful.”103:“But those whose scales are light, they are the ones who have lost their souls; in Hell they will abide forever.”104:“The Fire will scorch their faces, and they will be disfigured.”105:“Were not My verses recited to you, but you denied them?”106:“Our Lord! Our misfortune overwhelmed us, and we were a misguided people.”107:“Our Lord! Bring us out of this. If we return (to evil), then indeed we will be wrongdoers.”108:“He (Allah) will say: Stay therein, and do not speak to Me.”109–115: (Summary) Allah praises a group that remained faithful, but rejects the others, saying they stayed in the world only briefly and will return to Him for judgment.In this chapter, we see Muslims who perished in their sins. Allah rejects them and refuses to forgive them, even though their relatives prayed for them at death and performed cleansing rituals. Allah plainly states that He willnotforgive these Muslims. Additional evidence can be found in S. 35:36–37, S. 40:10–12, S. 43:74–77, S. 67:6–11, and S. 4:93.**ALLAH DOES NOT FORGIVE A MUSLIM WHO KILLS ANOTHER MUSLIM:EXAMPLE — SUNNI KILLING SHIA**Allah says that if a Muslim kills another Muslim intentionally, Allah willneverforgive that sin.Surat An-Nisa 93:“And whoever kills a believer intentionally, his recompense is Hell, to abide therein forever. Allah is angry with him, curses him, and has prepared for him a great punishment.”We have overwhelming evidence of Muslims killing one another— especially through bombings, warfare, and sectarian conflict. See news from the Middle East for more proof.If Sunnis and Shias kill each other, where will they all end up? Allah already saidthey will all be thrown into Helland He will never forgive them (Surat An-Nisa 93). Perhaps this is why Allah declared that all Muslims will enter Hell:Quran 40:60:“And your Lord says: Call upon Me; I will respond to you. But those who are too arrogant to worship Me will enter Hell humiliated.”My brothers and sisters, Allah concludes in Surah 40:60 that all who boast in Islam will enter Hell. So will any Muslim escape? It becomes clear that Allah contradicts himself about forgiveness because he already decreed that all Muslims will enter Hell.Even Allah Himself Will Enter HellNow read Sahih Bukhari:Bukhari, Vol. 6, Book 60, Hadith 371— narrated by Anas:“People will be thrown into Hell, and Hell will say: ‘Are there any more?’ until Allah will place His foot upon Hell and it will say, ‘Enough! Enough!’”Other references:Bukhari Vol. 9 Book 93 Hadith 481Bukhari Vol. 6 Book 60 Hadith 373This reveals a great secret:Allah himself enters Hell.Is this not a great tragedy for the religion of Muhammad, that even Allah goes to Hell?The Bible says Satan also enters the lake of fire last— just like Allah entering last when Hell asks for “more.”Revelation 20:10:“And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire… and will be tormented day and night forever and ever.”The Bible shows that the Devil enters Hell and finds others already there—exactly like the Hadith says Allah enters Hell and finds people inside.MORE VERSES WHERE ALLAH ADMITS HE CANNOT FORGIVE SINSNow examine Surat Al-Imran:3:86 — Allah says He will not guide those who believed then disbelieved, even after clear signs.3:87 — They will have Allah’s curse and that of angels and all mankind.3:88 — They will remain in punishment forever; no reduction and no delay.But 3:89 says:“Except those who repent afterwards and reform; Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.”Here Allah contradicts himself:— In verse 88 he says theywill neverbe forgiven.— In verse 89 he suddenly changes and says “if they repent, they will be forgiven.”Was Allah angry during revelation? Did he forget what he said in verse 88? Or is this the confusion and contradiction that fills the Quran?This passage clearly states thatdisbelievers who die as unbelievers will never be forgiven, even if they wish to return to Allah. Their repentance is rejected forever.But Muslims, according to the tafsir, may receive reduced punishment and temporary Hell.ConclusionAllah cannot forgive sins, and more than that, he cannot escape Hell.But Jesus Christforgives sinswith divine authority.Luke 7:48:“Then He said to the woman, ‘Your sins are forgiven.’”Mark 2:10:“But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins…”FINAL APPEALRomans 10:9:“If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.”Would you like to be saved and have assurance of Heaven?Confess that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, and today you will be saved.God bless you all,In His service,Max Shimba, servant of Jesus ChristMax Shimba Ministrieswww.maxshimbaministries.org",

This conduct raises significant questions about the prophetic character traditionally attributed to him.According toSahih Bukhari, Volume 3, Book 37, Chapter 8, Hadith 495 (page 280), it is stated:“When Allah made the Prophet wealthy without conflict, one-fifth of the war captives’ possessions were allocated to the treasury.”Similarly,Sahih Muslim, Volume 2, Book 5, Hadith 401, Number 2348 (page 519) indicates that Muhammad’s family retained shares of the spoils, illustrating that these acts contributed to their personal wealth.The first organized seizures of people’s property by early Muslims are historically documented as theNakha’ Raid. Even during the sacred months, when fighting was traditionally suspended, Muhammad’s followers attacked caravans, killing individuals and taking the survivors as captives. Muhammad personally led the second raid atBadr, consolidating both wealth and influence.Muhammad further expanded his wealth through attacks on Jewish settlements, notablyKhaybar. He and his loyal followers seized goods, women, and other property. Historical accounts record that after the surrender of 700–1,000 Jewish men from theBanu Quraizatribe, they were executed, and their women were taken. This raises critical questions regarding the ethical and prophetic nature of such actions.The evidence challenges the conventional narrative of Muhammad as solely a spiritual leader, showing that his rise was also facilitated through warfare, conquest, and appropriation of wealth.—Shimba Theological Institute Newsletter",

WHILE IN CHRISTIANITY, PEOPLE ARE HEALED IN THE NAME OF JESUS?Why does the name of Allah have no power to heal diseases?Allah failed to heal Muhammad.Gabriel’s prayer failed.But the name of Jesus heals every disease.Have you ever seen a healing crusade in Islam?Dear Reader,What is healing?Healing is an act of faith — receiving life in spirit or body through prayer, the laying on of hands, or hearing the true Word of Christ Jesus. This act of faith brings both spiritual wholeness and physical health to the believer. Remember — many who were healed of physical ailments were also healed in their spirits.So why is it that when Allah sent Gabriel (Jibril) to pray for his prophet Muhammad — who was sick from eating poison — their prayer failed to work?Healing does not come from any human being. Even the best doctors do not heal; they only provide treatment. The one who truly heals is God. Servants of God merely serve as vessels or channels through whom the Lord releases His healing to those in need.Now let us examine Allah and Gabriel in their attempt to heal Muhammad:According toIbn Sa’d, page 265,Aisha, the wife of the Prophet Muhammad, said:“When the Prophet of Allah was sick, Gabriel used to pray for him, saying: ‘In the name of Allah, may He heal you from all diseases and pains, and from every evil that may wish you harm. You shall be healed...’”But did the name of Allah heal Muhammad? Let us read whatSahih al-Bukharirecords:Muhammad’s Response after Being Prayed for by Allah/Gabriel:Bukhari’s Hadith 5.713Narrated by Aisha:“The Prophet, during his illness which led to his death, used to say, ‘O Aisha, I still feel the pain caused by the food I ate at Khaibar, and at this very moment, I feel as if my aorta is being cut because of that poison.’”Can God pray and fail? Why did the prayers of Allah and Gabriel for Muhammad’s healing not work?Now let us read about Jesus in the Bible — did He heal people?“When Jesus came into Peter’s house, He saw Peter’s mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever. He touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she got up and began to serve Him.” —Matthew 8:14–15The Bible does not tell us that Jesus prayed for this woman. It simply says that He touched her, and the fever left. Just one touch from the Man of God was enough because the anointing was within Him. Even Peter’s shadow healed the sick because of the same anointing (Acts 5:15).THE IMPORTANCE OF PUTTING YOUR FAITH IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST“Now Peter and John were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour. And a man lame from birth was being carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple called Beautiful, to ask alms of those entering the temple. Seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, he asked to receive alms. Peter directed his gaze at him, as did John, and said, ‘Look at us.’ And he fixed his attention on them, expecting to receive something from them. But Peter said, ‘Silver and gold have I none, but what I have I give you:In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk.’ And he took him by the right hand and raised him up, and immediately his feet and ankles were made strong. And leaping up he stood and began to walk...” —Acts 3:1–8If you follow this man’s story, you will see that he had been lame since birth and was over forty years old when he was healed (Acts 4:22).What was the secret behind this miracle? Did Peter and John heal the man by their own power, or by the power of the name of Jesus Christ?Many people today, when they see someone used by God in healing, place their faith in the person instead of in the name of Jesus Christ. The same thing happened when the lame man was healed — people marveled at Peter and John as though they had healed him by their own power.But Peter corrected them:“When the man who was healed clung to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the portico called Solomon’s, astounded. And when Peter saw it, he addressed the people: ‘Men of Israel, why do you wonder at this, or why do you stare at us, as though by our own power or piety we have made him walk?’” —Acts 3:11–12Peter clarified that the power that healed the man did not belong to them. He explained:“The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified His servant Jesus... And by faith in His name, His name has made this man strong whom you see and know; and the faith that is through Jesus has given the man this perfect health in the presence of you all.” —Acts 3:13–16Reflect on Peter’s words:“By faith in His name, His name has made this man strong.”Peter and John placed their faith in the name of Jesus Christ. They knew that the secret to miracles lay in that name. That’s why when they met the lame man, they commanded him to rise in that very name!Place your faith in the name of Jesus Christ if you want to see signs and miracles of Jesus in your life and among those you serve.The early disciples understood this truth. When they were forbidden by the high priest Annas “to speak or teach in the name of Jesus,” they prayed, saying:“‘Now, Lord, look upon their threats and grant to your servants to continue to speak your word with all boldness, while You stretch out Your hand to heal, and signs and wonders are performed through the name of Your holy servant Jesus.’” —Acts 4:18, 29–31It is vital to remind people of the importance of putting their faith in the name of Jesus Christ if they want to see God’s hand healing, performing signs, and working miracles.Dear Reader, why waste your time with witch doctors or fortune tellers?

Do men gather grapes from thornbushes or figs from thistles? Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.”Prophet Muhammad failed to demonstrate righteousness in his mission. The work he claimed to be sent by God to do was filled with many contradictions that led people to call him“insane.”His act of marrying a six-year-old child caused great confusion, because such an act is inhumane and was never practiced by any prophet who came before him.Below is a verse from the Qur’an, said to have been revealed by the god of Islam through the angel Gabriel:Qur’an 15:6–“And they say, ‘O you upon whom the message has been sent down, indeed you are mad!’(http://www.quranitukufu.net/015.html)Muhammad was calledinsanein the presence of the public. What is striking is that he never denied this accusation. Instead, he remained silent — a silence that itself served as an admission of guilt. His own writings and Islamic sources further confirm this insanity.Let us look briefly at his own account inKitab al-Tabaqat al-Kabir (The Book of Major Classes)byIbn Sa’d, translated byS. Moinal Haq, Vol. 4, p. 225, where Muhammad is recorded as saying:“O Khadija, I see light, and I hear voices, and I fear that I am mad.”In this narration, the Prophet of Allah openly admits that he fears he is insane. Such an admission raises many questions — questions that, in most cases, remain unanswered.But we must ask:Why would Allah reveal a verse calling his own prophet insane?Why didn’t Muhammad deny being called insane? The prophetic mission of Muhammad becomes highly questionable when he himself admits, “O Khadija, … I fear that I am mad.”In all other Holy Scriptures, we have never read of any prophet of the Bible admitting to being insane. Yet here we find Muhammad, the prophet of Allah, confessing it.So, why should we follow a prophet who acknowledged that he was insane? That is a fundamental question.Allah himself, in the Qur’an, instructs Muslims to ask thePeople of the Book— the Jews and the Christians — when they have doubts or questions, for they possess knowledge.Allah has already answered:Christians hold the truth and have the answers for this world.MUHAMMAD SAID:“I fear that I am mad.”Copyright © Max Shimba Ministries 2013",

As we see above, Muhammad gave witchcraft to his beloved wife.Where do we ever read that the Prophets of the Bible used witchcraft?Muhammad believed in the evil eye and had charms against it.(Al-Tabari, Vol. 39, p. 134).The last two chapters of the Qur’an (Surahs 113 and 114) were written concerning the evil eye according to(Ibn-i-Majah, Vol. 5, No. 3517, p. 41).However, Surahs 113 and 114 aremissingfrom Ibn Mas’ud’s version of the Qur’an(The Fihrist, p. 57).This omission was not accidental. It is recorded that Ibn Mas’ud said:“The two charms—Surahs [113, 114]—are not part of the Book of God.”Ibn Mas’ud was Muhammad’s personal secretary. Muhammad told people to learn the Qur’an from Ibn Mas’ud and three others.(Bukhari, Vol. 6, Book 60, Section 8, No. 521, pp. 486–487).MUHAMMAD SAID THAT TALISMANS CURE THE EVIL EYEHe claimed that witchcraft (charms) cures the evil eye.(Ibn-i-Majah, Vol. 5, Nos. 3510, 3511, p. 41; Vol. 5, No. 3512, p. 42).AL-BADIRI IS A FORM OF MAGICAl-Badiri was permitted as protection against the evil eye according to(Ibn-i-Majah, Vol. 5, Nos. 3513–3518, pp. 42–44).The evil eye is treated as a real condition.(Bukhari, Vol. 7, Book 71, Sections 36 & 86, Nos. 636, 827, pp. 427, 538).Also read(Bukhari, Vol. 4, Book 55, Section 9, No. 590, p. 386).The evil eye is indeed real.(Ibn-i-Majah, Vol. 5, Nos. 3506, 3507, p. 39).“The influence of the evil eye is a fact.”—(Sahih Muslim, Vol. 3, Book 24, No. 5426, p. 1192; also Nos. 5424–5427, p. 1192).It is said that Amir bin Rabia cast the evil eye upon a man.(Ibn-i-Majah, Vol. 5, No. 3508, p. 40).However, Muhammad’s hair was believed to cure the evil eye.(Bukhari, Vol. 7, Book 72, Section 65, No. 784, p. 518).When Muhammad’s hair was shaved, his followers rushed to grab every strand to keep it as a sacred relic. Muhammad kindly distributed his hair among them.(Sahih Muslim, Vol. 2, Book 7, Nos. 2991–2994, pp. 656–657).MAGIC THROUGH CUPPING ON SPECIFIC DATESMuhammad also said that if people performcupping(bloodletting) on the 17th, 19th, or 21st day of the lunar month, it will cure every disease.(Abu Dawud, Vol. 3, No. 3852, p. 1084).If Muhammad was truly a Prophet of God, why did he practice witchcraft?If Allah is truly God, why would He allow the use of witchcraft?If Islam comes from God, why does it allow magical charms?Come to Jesus Christ, the Living God and Great Lord.May God bless you abundantly,In His Service,Max Shimba Ministries Org.©2015 Max Shimba Ministries Org.

What they imply is that the Qur’an today is the reliable Word of God, while the Bible is not. Although the Bible contains many textual variations with minor differences, there is no serious evidence that its teachings have been altered. The Qur’an, however, shows much stronger evidence of corruption according to the records of Ubai, the abrogated verses of Uthman, and other Qur’anic problems. Yet, the greatest doctrinal corruption in Islam — introduced by Muslims themselves — is the story of the“daughters of Allah.”SummaryThe Christian websiteAnswering-Islam.orgwrites:“One of the most embarrassing incidents in Muhammad’s life occurred when Satan inserted his own words into Muhammad’s mouth. Muhammad spoke Satan’s words as though they were God’s revelation. This event is recorded in early Islamic writings and is mentioned in both the Hadith and the Qur’an. Later Muslims, ashamed that their self-proclaimed prophet had spoken Satan’s words, denied the incident ever happened. Numerous excuses and denials were later invented to cover up this grievous sin committed by Muhammad.”It is important to understand that theincident of the “Satanic Verses”was not fabricated by non-Muslims. It is documented in the earliest Islamic sources that existed during Muhammad’s own lifetime. No one should assume it was invented by Islam’s enemies; it is a story preserved within authentic early Muslim records.This is one of the most controversial subjects in Islam — the claim that Satan caused Muhammad to utter his own (Satan’s) words as if they were God’s.What Did the Qur’an Originally Say?SurahAn-Najm(The Star), verses 19–20, state:“Have you considered al-Lat and al-‘Uzza,and another, the third, Manat?”Before Islam,Allahwas already known in Arabia as a god who had three daughters:al-Lat, al-‘Uzza,andManat.(Note: “al-” in Arabic means “the.”)Four early Muslim biographers wrote that these verses were originally followed by:“These are the exalted maidens (intercessors) whose prayers are to be hoped for.”Translation:The daughters of Allah were believed to be heavenly beings who could intercede for others. “Exalted cranes” or “lofty maidens” was a poetic metaphor describing them. Alternate readings for “whose prayers are to be hoped for” (turtaja) include “whose intercession is accepted with approval” (turtada).(Source: Alfred Guillaume’s translation ofThe Life of Muhammadby Ibn Ishaq, p.166.)Later, this passage wasremovedand replaced with the current reading:“What! For you the male and for Him, the female?Behold, such would be an unfair division!” (Qur’an 53:21–22)Meaning:Those who believed that Allah had three daughters treated Him unjustly, since they preferred sons for themselves but assigned daughters to God.These added lines are what came to be called“The Satanic Verses.”Centuries later, author Salman Rushdie used the phrase as the title of his novel, though his work was fictional and unrelated to these original verses.The remainder of the text provides bothdirectandindirectevidence supporting the historical reality of the Satanic Verses — along with nine Muslim objections to the story and responses to each.The Four Early Biographers of Muhammad — Direct EvidenceEarly Muslim historians frequently accepted reports from multiple sources as reliable if three or more independent narrators confirmed them. The Satanic Verses were not reported by outsiders but byfour early Muslim scholarswho documented Muhammad’s life — all within Islamic tradition. Three of them wrote before the most famous Hadith collections that Sunni Islam relies upon today.Al-Wahidi / Al-Waqidi (d. 823 CE)—Asbab al-NuzulHe wrote that one day, while the leaders of Mecca were gathered by the Ka‘bah, Muhammad joined them and began reciting Surah 53. When he reached the verses about al-Lat, al-‘Uzza, and Manat, Satan whispered conciliatory words into his mind — words Muhammad longed to hear from God:“These are the exalted cranes; their intercession is to be hoped for.”The Quraysh were overjoyed, thinking Muhammad had acknowledged their goddesses, and they all bowed in worship. Later, Gabriel visited Muhammad and said:“What have you done? You recited before the people words I never gave you.”Muhammad grieved deeply afterward.Ibn Sa’d (d. 845 CE)—Kitab al-Tabaqat al-KabirA historian of early Muslims, he repeated the same narrative, confirming that the event was known and accepted among early believers.Ibn Ishaq (d. 767 CE)—Sirat Rasul Allah(The Life of the Prophet of God)He wrote that Muslims who had emigrated to Abyssinia heard that the Meccans had accepted Islam after Muhammad recited Surah 53, and they began to return home. This happened because both Muslims and pagans bowed together when Muhammad recited those verses — until Gabriel later revealed that Satan had inserted them.Al-Tabari (d. 923 CE)—History of the Prophets and Kings(Tarikh al-Tabari)Tabari explained that Muhammad, grieved by his people’s rejection, desired reconciliation. When he recited verses 19–20 of Surah 53, Satan tempted him to add the lines praising the “exalted cranes.” The Quraysh rejoiced, and even the Muslims bowed in worship. But afterward, Gabriel rebuked him, saying, “You have spoken words not from God.”Later Muslim Scholars Who Mentioned the EventOther respected Islamic authorities who discussed the incident include:Abu Ma‘shar of Khorasan (787–885 CE)Ibn Abi HatimIbn al-MundhirIbn Hajar al-‘Asqalani (773–852 AH)Ibn MardawayhMusa ibn ‘UqbaThe famous commentator al-Zamakhshari (1070–1143 CE) in his exegesis of Qur’an 22:52Indirect Evidence — The Qur’an and HadithHadith evidence:According toSahih al-BukhariandAbu Dawud, when Muhammad recited Surah 53,both Muslims and pagansfell in prostration. (Bukhari Vol.3 Book 19 Nos.173 & 176; Vol.6 Book 60 Nos.385–386; Abu Dawud Vol.1 No.1401).This mass prostration of pagans makes sense only if Muhammad had just spoken favorably about their deities.Qur’anic evidence:Surah 22:52 states:“Never did We send a messenger or a prophet before you, but when he desired, Satan threw some (false suggestions) into his desire; but Allah abolishes that which Satan throws in and then makes His verses firm.”Surah 17:73–75 warns Muhammad not to compromise with the pagans or alter revelation, implying he was tempted to do so.The Nine Muslim Objections and Responses(The article continues to list and refute nine objections raised by later Muslims, arguing that the historical and textual evidence strongly supports the authenticity of the Satanic Verses incident.)ConclusionMuslim scholars themselves have long debated whether the Satanic Verses were ever truly spoken. Either:Muhammad did speak them— in which case he was deceived by Satan and thus a false prophet for that moment,orHe did not speak them— in which case the four earliest Muslim historians all fabricated the same event.Whichever option one chooses, the implication remains: Islam admits that Allah allows his message to be distorted, as even Qur’an 22:52 confirms that Satan can insert falsehood into prophetic revelation — later to be “corrected.”In contrast, the Bible teaches thatGod faithfully preserves His Word.Believers are therefore called totrust in God, who has kept His message pure and uncorrupted throughout history.“Mighty is our God, who is able to preserve His Word.Believe in the Lord who has kept His Word.”(Translation ends before Qur’an 5:46–48 reference section.)The Qur’an Confirms the Integrity of Previous ScripturesAfter analyzing the “Satanic Verses” episode — where Satan allegedly inserted words into Muhammad’s revelation — one cannot help but contrast this with howthe Qur’an itself testifiesabout the authenticity and divine origin of theTorah,Psalms, andGospel. Ironically, while the Qur’an acknowledges that Satan deceived Muhammad at least once, it repeatedly affirms that the earlier Scriptures — the Bible — remain trustworthy, guiding, and authoritative.Let’s look carefully at several key Qur’anic passages:1. Qur’an 5:46–48 – The Gospel Confirming the Torah“And We sent, following in their footsteps, Jesus, the son of Mary, confirming that which came before him in the Torah; and We gave him the Gospel, wherein is guidance and light, confirming that which preceded it in the Torah, and a guidance and an admonition for the righteous.Let the People of the Gospel judge by what Allah has revealed therein; and whoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed – such are the rebellious.And We have revealed to you the Book in truth, confirming the Scripture that came before it and guarding it.”This passage clearly states that:Jesus confirmed the Torah(Old Testament law).The Gospel was itself revelation from Allah, containingguidance and light.The Qur’an came to confirm previous Scriptures, not to replace them.If these Scriptures had been corrupted before Muhammad’s time, then Allah would not command Christians to“judge by what Allah has revealed therein.”You cannot judge by something that no longer exists. Therefore, the Qur’an affirms thatthe Torah and Gospel remained intactat the time of Muhammad.2. Qur’an 10:94 – Muhammad Instructed to Consult the People of the Book“So if you (Muhammad) are in doubt concerning that which We have revealed to you, then ask those who have been reading the Scripture before you. Verily the truth has come to you from your Lord, so do not be of the doubters.”This verse is a powerful admission. Allah himself tells Muhammad thatif he doubts his revelation, he should consult Jews and Christians— people who read the previous Scriptures.If those Scriptures were already corrupted, Allah’s command would make no sense. Instead, it indicates thatthe earlier Books were considered accurateand that their readers were seen as reliable witnesses of divine truth.3. Qur’an 6:115 – God’s Word Cannot Be Changed“The Word of your Lord has been fulfilled in truth and in justice. None can change His words; and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.”This statement directly contradicts the Muslim claim that the Bible was altered. If no one can change God’s words, and if the Torah and Gospel were originally God’s words, thenthey must remain uncorrupted.4. Qur’an 18:27 – Divine Preservation“And recite what has been revealed to you from the Book of your Lord. None can alter His words, and you will find no refuge besides Him.”This verse repeats the principle of divine preservation — not only for the Qur’an but for all previous revelations given by God.The Logical Contradiction within Islamic ClaimsIslamic apologists often argue that the Bible was corrupted, yet the Qur’an was sent to“confirm”it. However, these claims cannot coexist logically.If:The Bible wascorrupted beforeMuhammad’s time,The Qur’an came toconfirmthe Bible,Then the Qur’an would be confirming acorruptedrevelation — which would mean Allah confirmed a lie.But if Allah cannot confirm falsehood, thenthe Bible must have still been purewhen the Qur’an was revealed.Furthermore, theSatanic Versesincident shows thatthe Qur’an itself was once vulnerable to Satanic interference— something that never happened with the Bible. Thus, the Qur’an, by its own admission, demonstrates fallibility where the Bible consistently shows divine preservation.The Christian Perspective: God’s Word Is EternalFrom the Christian theological standpoint, the Word of God isincorruptible and eternally preserved. The Scriptures themselves testify to this truth:Psalm 119:89:“Forever, O LORD, Your word is settled in heaven.”Isaiah 40:8:“The grass withers, the flower fades, but the word of our God stands forever.”Matthew 24:35:Jesus said, “Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will never pass away.”These passages establish the unchanging nature of divine revelation. No prophet, scribe, or adversary — not even Satan — can alter what God has decreed to be His Word.The Theological Implication of the Satanic VersesThe “Satanic Verses” incident presents a theological problem for Islam:It shows thatMuhammad could be deceived by Satan, even in revelation.It demonstrates thatAllah allowed Satan’s words to be spoken as if divine, later “correcting” them.It contradicts the Qur’an’s own statement thatSatan has no authority over prophets or the faithful(Qur’an 15:42).By contrast,Jesus Christ— the Word made flesh — wasnever deceived,never corrected, andnever influenced by Satan.When tempted in the wilderness, Jesus responded only with the uncorrupted Word of God (Matthew 4:1–11). He rebuked Satan, declaring,“Get thee behind me, Satan!”Thus, the moral and theological distinction is clear:Muhammad temporarily submitted to Satan’s whisper.Jesus eternally triumphed over Satan’s deception.Final ReflectionIf Satan could place his words into Muhammad’s mouth — and if Allah later had to correct them — then the integrity of the Qur’an depends not on divine preservation, but on post-revelation editing and human correction.In contrast, the Bible showsa consistent, unbroken testimonyfrom Genesis to Revelation — all pointing to one central truth:“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.”(John 1:1)That Word — Jesus Christ — was not only immune to Satan’s deception but destroyed his works completely (1 John 3:8).Conclusion:The “Satanic Verses” episode exposes a fundamental contradiction in Islam’s doctrine of revelation and preservation. While the Qur’an admits Satanic interference, it simultaneously acknowledges the purity of earlier Scriptures — the Torah, Psalms, and Gospel.Therefore, the consistent conclusion is thatthe Bible remains the true, preserved Word of God, while the Qur’an’s history reveals internal corruption and theological inconsistency.“Mighty is our God, who preserves His Word forever.Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ — the Living Word — who can never be deceived.”",

Now, people do not seek forgiveness for bodily weaknesses but for moral faults.InSahih Muslim, Volume 1, Book 4, Chapter 268, No. 1695, page 373, Muhammad prays:“I have wronged myself and I repent for my sins. Forgive my sins...”Bukharialso records similar confessions: Volume 1, Book 2, Chapter 13, No. 19, page 23; Volume 1.12.57, No. 781, page 434; Volume 6.60.3, No. 3, page 4; Volume 8.75.3, No. 319, page 213; and Volume 8.75.62 (before No. 407), page 271—all referencing Muhammad’s sins.Furthermore,BukhariVolume 1.4.70, No. 234, page 148; and Volume 8.82.1, Nos. 794–795, page 520, describe how Muhammad ordered people’s hands and feet to be cut off, their eyes gouged out, and left them to die of thirst after being mutilated. See alsoBukhariVolume 8.82.3, No. 796, Chapter 4, page 797; Volume 6, Chapter 150 (before No. 198), pages 158–159; andFiqh-us-Sunnah, Volume 1, page 133.Surely, you will agree these are grave sins. Since Muhammad committed such acts, he was in desperate need of forgiveness. The probing question is:“Who pays for your sins?”Jesus said that He paid the price for our sins. Islam does not teach that anyone has paid for sin. So how are your sins forgiven? Does Allah simply overlook some sins and punish others?Some people might think that evil has no consequence as long as one calls himself a Muslim. But in this century, Muslims have killed Christians and committed atrocities in their villages in Sudan, Nigeria, and Indonesia. When those called Christians killed Muslims, people said they acted contrary to the character of Christ. Yet, when Muslims kill Christians—those who worship the true God—I have never heard anyone say they acted contrary to the character of Muhammad.Forgive me for speaking so plainly, but the murder of those who worship God by Muslims must stop. When Muslims justify these killings because even their prophet did the same, people are left to question their prophet, their Allah who contradicts His own word, and the very foundation of Islam.Consider the Sinless ProphetUnlike Muhammad, there was One who:Declared Himself to be the Prophet of God,Fulfilled hundreds of prophecies and their meanings,Never needed forgiveness, for He had no sin to forgive,Never killed or threatened the life of any traveler,Upheld the highest moral standards (He forbade sexual violence),Promised to pay the penalty for our sins,Suffered and died for you, andHas no grave, for He rose from the dead.This Man isJesus Christ.Christians do not say of Jesus,“Peace of God be upon Him,”because Jesusisthe King of Peace—the peace of God rests upon Him.Yet my hope is that you may come to know how the peace and love of Jesus can live within your heart.Dr. Max Shimbawww.maxshimbaministries.org",

There is a profound difference between Muhammad and Jesus: Muhammad is dead, but Jesus lives today and will live forever and ever.Prophet Muhammad was born around 570 CE in the city of Mecca and died at the age of approximately 62 on June 8, 632, in Medina, present-day Saudi Arabia, where his tomb remains. In summary, Muhammad died, was buried, and his remains are still in his grave today.In contrast, Jesus was born around four years before the common era. He died on the cross around the age of 30 in Jerusalem. His body was placed in a tomb, but its current location is irrelevant, because God raised Him from the dead after three days! Forty days later, God took Him up to heaven, where He sits at the right hand of God on the throne.Jesus is alive today and will never die again! This is the fundamental difference between Muhammad and Jesus. Muhammad is dead, but Jesus lives today, eternally and forever.The Apostle John recounts:“When I saw Him (Jesus), I fell at His feet as though dead. But He laid His right hand on me and said, ‘Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last, and the Living One. I was dead, and now look, I am alive forever and ever! And I hold the keys of death and Hades.’” (Revelation 1:17-18)Here, Jesus claims that He is the First and the Last, implying that no one will come after Him. Therefore, the Islamic claim that Muhammad is the last prophet is erroneous, because no one comes after Jesus. He is the Alpha and the Omega—the Unique One.Comparing Jesus and Christianity with Muhammad and IslamJesus / ChristianityMuhammad / IslamJesus’ birth and life were foretold by over 300 prophecies.Muhammad’s birth was not prophesied by any scriptures.Jesus’ birth was miraculous, as even the Qur’an affirms.Muhammad was born like any ordinary man.According to Hebrews 4:15, Jesus “was tempted in every way, just as we are—yet was without sin.” He lived a sinless life.Muhammad was a sinner like all other humans. He lied, deceived, broke promises, and engaged in sexual immorality. The Qur’an never claims Muhammad was sinless.Jesus performed miracles, which were recognized even by his Jewish opponents (although they accused him of doing so by Satan’s power). These miracles affirmed his divine claims.Muhammad did not perform miracles, except for his claim of receiving the Qur’an as a revelation. There is little to substantiate this claim outside of his own words.Jesus is God.Muhammad was an ordinary man.Jesus lived out his teachings, exemplifying his doctrine in his own life, especially love.Muhammad preached and taught, but often failed to live up to his own teachings.Jesus committed no evil acts.Muhammad engaged in violence, killed his enemies, raided caravans, and plundered Bedouin tribes, taking spoils of war.Jesus never used violence to persuade anyone to follow his teachings. He said, for example, in John 7:17, “Anyone who chooses to do the will of God will find out whether my teaching comes from God or whether I speak on my own.”Muhammad often used violence to force people to become Muslims. Even the Qur’an speaks of violence against unbelievers.Jesus taught his disciples about love and truth. Nowhere in the Gospels did he instruct his followers to harm, kill, or rob anyone.Muhammad taught his followers to kill and rob in his name.Jesus was pure in thought, word, and deed.Muhammad had up to twenty wives and concubines, the youngest being nine years old.Jesus died for the sins of others.Muhammad died for his own sins, as any other human being.Jesus died for us.Muhammad killed others for his own benefit.Jesus foretold his own death and resurrection.Muhammad died suddenly and unexpectedly, with little preparation for his followers.Jesus rose from the dead, witnessed by many throughout the Bible. Paul writes in 1 Corinthians 15:6, “Then he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep.”Muhammad’s body decayed and remains in his tomb. Though there are later legends of Muhammad’s ascension, neither the Qur’an nor early Islamic traditions affirm this.Jesus never contradicted himself.Muhammad frequently changed his statements, sometimes praising Jews, other times condemning them. In the so-called “Satanic Verses” (later removed from the Qur’an), Muhammad momentarily affirmed the worship of Allah’s three daughters, then retracted it, becoming even more vehement against Christian claims about the Son of God.The Bible versus the Qur’anThe Bible consists of 66 books, written by about 40 different authors over several millennia. These writers came from every walk of life, from kings like David and Solomon to simple shepherds like Amos. Despite their vast differences in time, culture, and status, the Bible presents a unified message—God’s character, and what is right and wrong, is consistently clear throughout. Among these 66 books, there are hundreds of prophecies, including about 300 specifically concerning Jesus, which were fulfilled in detail in his life. There are also prophecies about Israel and neighboring nations such as Assyria, Babylon, and Persia, many of which have come to pass.All this serves as strong evidence of the Bible’s divine origin. As it says, “…for prophecy never had its origin in the human will, but prophets, though human, spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.” (2 Peter 1:21) Without the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, it is difficult to imagine how these diverse books could fit together so seamlessly, like pieces of a puzzle.The Qur’an, on the other hand, was written by one man over his lifetime. It contains no specific prophecies that can be verified. While it sometimes claims to affirm the Bible, it often contradicts or rejects key elements of the biblical narrative.www.maxshimbaministries.org",

Their underlying claim is that the Qur’an, as it exists today, is a reliable word of God, unlike the Bible. While the Bible indeed has many variant manuscripts with minor differences, the evidence for doctrinal corruption is weak. In contrast, the Qur’an itself demonstrates significant evidence of alteration, according to sources such as Ubayy, abrogated verses, ‘Uthman’s recension, and other problems. However, perhaps the greatest doctrinal difference brought forth by Muslims themselves concerns the so-called “Daughters of Allah.”SummaryThe Christian websiteAnswering Islamstates:“One of the most embarrassing events in Muhammad’s life occurred when Satan inserted his words into Muhammad’s mouth, and Muhammad spoke Satan’s words as if they were from God. This incident has been recorded in Islamic literature by several early Muslim authors and is mentioned in both the Hadith and the Qur’an. Later Muslims, ashamed that their self-declared prophet spoke the words of Satan, have tried to deny that this event happened. Many excuses and denials have been made by these later Muslims to cover up the grave sin of Muhammad.”It is important to note that the event of the “Satanic Verses” is not a fabrication by non-Muslims. It is recorded in the oldest available Islamic sources, contemporary with Muhammad’s lifetime. No one should think this is a tale invented by critics of Islam; it is found directly in early Islamic records.This is one of the most controversial subjects within Islam. Satan caused Muhammad to utter his (Satan’s) words as if they were from God.What Did the Qur’an Say Originally?Surah An-Najm (The Star), Surah 53:19-20states:“Have you considered al-Lat and al-‘Uzza, and another, the third (goddess), Manat?”Allah was already famous in Arabia before Islam, known as a deity with three daughters: al-Lat, al-Uzza, and Manat (note that “al-” means “the” in Arabic). Four early biographers of Muhammad wrote that these verses were originally followed by:“These are the exalted cranes (intercessors) whose intercession is to be hoped for.”Interpretation:The Daughters of Allah were believed to be celestial beings who could intercede on behalf of others. The “exalted cranes” was a metaphor for them. Alternate translations for “to be hoped for” (“turtaja”) include “whose intercession is approved” (“turtada”). (From Alfred Guillaume’s translation ofThe Life of Muhammadby Ibn Ishaq, p.166.)Later, this passage was removed and replaced with:“Is the male for you and the female for Him? That, then, is an unjust division.” (Surah 53:21-22 today)Interpretation:Those who believed Allah had three daughters were unjust to Allah, preferring sons for themselves while attributing only daughters to Allah.These are the so-called “Satanic Verses.” In modern times, Salman Rushdie used this phrase in the title of his fictional novel, but this writing does not discuss the contemporary controversy. For the original Satanic Verses, how can any fair-minded person, Muslim or not, determine which verses were present originally? The remainder of this article provides direct and indirect evidence that the Satanic Verses were indeed present, as well as nine Islamic objections.The Four Early Biographers of Muhammad: Direct EvidenceWhile not everything early Muslims said about Muhammad is necessarily true, Islamic scholars generally accept things attributed to Muhammad that are confirmed by at least three sources. We know the Satanic Verses did not originate from non-Muslim sources but from four distinct early Muslim biographers. Notably, three of these authors wrote before the major Sunni hadith collections.1.Al-Wahidi/Waqidi(d. 207/823 CE) –Asbab al-Nuzul“One day, the chiefs of Mecca gathered beside the Ka‘bah and discussed their city’s affairs; Muhammad appeared and sat near them in a friendly manner, beginning to recite Surah 53. When he reached the verses: ‘Have you considered al-Lat, al-Uzza, and Manat, the third, the other?’ the devil suggested words of reconciliation he had long desired, placing in his mouth words eagerly awaited from God: ‘These are the exalted cranes, whose intercession is to be hoped for.’ The Quraysh rejoiced at this acceptance of their deities, and as Muhammad concluded the Surah, the entire gathering prostrated together. That evening Gabriel visited him and, after Muhammad recited the Surah, said, ‘What have you done? You recited to the people what I did not bring to you!’ Muhammad was grieved…”2.Ibn Sa‘d(d. 230/845 CE) –Kitab al-Tabaqat al-KabirIbn Sa‘d, familiar with al-Wahidi’s work, was himself a biographer and author of a 15-volume history.3.Ibn Ishaq(d. 145/767 or 151/773 CE) –Sirat Rasul Allah“[The emigrants] remained in [Ethiopia] until they heard that the people of Mecca had accepted Islam. This was because Surah An-Najm had been revealed and recited by Muhammad. A believer and a polytheist listened in silence as he said: ‘Have you considered al-Lat and al-‘Uzza?’ All listened intently; when believers heard the ‘satanic suggestion,’ some reverted to idolatry, saying: ‘By Allah, we will serve them so they may bring us closer to Allah.’ Satan taught these two verses to all idolaters, who grasped them easily. This distressed the Prophet until Gabriel visited and complained…” (Transmission chain: Yazid bin Ziyad → Muhammad bin Ishaq → Salama → Ibn Hamid → Ibn Ishaq)4.Ibn Jarir al-Tabari(d. 923 CE) –History of the Prophets and Kings, vol. 6, pp. 108-110“When the Messenger of God saw his people turning away, he wished in his heart for a revelation that would reconcile them. Upon reaching: ‘Have you considered al-Lat and al-Uzza, and Manat, the third, the other?’ Satan interjected, because of his inner deliberations, the words: ‘These are the exalted cranes whose intercession is to be hoped for.’ The Quraysh rejoiced, believing their gods were affirmed, and the Muslims, trusting their Prophet, did not doubt him. Later Gabriel came and said: ‘Muhammad, what have you done? You recited to the people what I did not bring to you…’”Other Early Islamic Scholars Who Mentioned This EventAbu Ma’shar of Khorasan (787–885 CE)Ibn Abi HatimIbn al-MundhirIbn Hajar al-Asqalani (773–852 CE)Ibn MardawayhMusa ibn ‘UqbaZamakhshari’s commentary on Surah 22:52 (1070–1143 CE)(Sources:The Book of the Major Classes, translated by S. Moinul ‘Haq)Indirect Evidence from the Qur’an and HadithSahih al-Bukhari(d. 870 CE) records that when Muhammad recited Surah An-Najm, both pagans and Muslims prostrated (vol. 3, book 19, nos. 173 & 176; vol. 6, book 60, nos. 385–386; Abu Dawud vol. 1, book 2, chapter 481, no. 1401). Pagans are not known to have prostrated for any other Qur’anic recitation. Why this one, unless the recitation included affirmation of their deities?Surah 22:52says:“We did not send before you any messenger or prophet except that when he desired, Satan threw [some suggestion] into his desire; but Allah abolishes that which Satan throws in, then Allah makes precise His verses.”Surah 17:73–75states:“They almost lured you away from what We have revealed to you, so that you would invent something else against Us; then they would have taken you as a friend. And if We had not strengthened you, you would almost have inclined to them a little. Then We would have made you taste double punishment in life and double after death. Then you would not find for yourself against Us a helper.”Note:Although some claim that Surah 17:73–75 was revealed during the “Isra and Mi’raj,” both Tabari and Ibn Sa’d state it was revealed around the time of the Satanic Verses. Muslims even have a specific word for satanic whispering, “waswas,” echoing this concept.Nine Common Muslim Objections and Scholarly ResponsesObjection 1:Only eleven early authorities mention the Satanic Verses; others, such as Imam Muslim, Abu Dawud, al-Nasai, Ahmad ibn Hanbal, and Ibn Hisham, do not.Response:Many hadiths are not found in every collection. For example, Bukhari contains long hadiths absent from Muslim. Ibn Hisham, who used Ibn Ishaq’s work, omitted the Satanic Verses section because he considered it problematic. If he was too embarrassed to include it, this omission is not proof of its non-occurrence.Objection 2:The alleged Satanic Verses do not fit with the rest of Surah 53.Response:The current text replaced the original, and parts of a surah were sometimes revealed at different times. We do not know if the entirety of Surah 53, post verse 22, was written at once. Verses 51–53 seem out of place, as they address Muhammad personally.Objection 3:Surah 53:19–21 may have been revealed before the verses about Satanic whisperings.Response:Tabari and Ibn Sa’d say they were revealed simultaneously with Surah 17:73–75. Exact timings are uncertain, but even if revealed earlier, this does not negate the content. If Muslims trust the Qur’an, including Surah 17:73–75 and 22:52, they must accept that Satan can insert words into revelation.Objection 4:The Satanic Verses contradict monotheism, which Muhammad consistently taught.Response:Muhammad is not shown to have been perfectly consistent. Bukhari (vol. 4, book 54, no. 490; vol. 8, book 53, no. 400) records he was bewitched for a time. These biographers were still Muslims, indicating that people followed Muhammad even if he erred.Objection 5:Many verses state that Muhammad could not speak falsely, so this story is incompatible.Response:The claim is that Satan, not Muhammad, produced the false verses. The Qur’an’s preservation does not preclude temporary satanic interference that is later corrected by God. Also, abrogation (nasikh) is a Qur’anic principle, with some verses lost after being abrogated (cf. Sahih Muslim vol. 1, book 244, no. 1433). Thus, the Qur’an’s textual preservation is debated.Objection 6:Tabari may have been an unreliable collector of reports.Response:Even if so, three other biographers wrote about the event, two before Tabari. Dismissing all as unreliable is not tenable. Tabari was not uncritical; for example, he expressed doubts about some reports from people of the Torah (Woman in the Qur’an, Tradition, and Their Interpretation, Barbara Freye Stowasser, p. 28).Objection 7:The strongest hadiths do not mention this story explicitly.Response:Bukhari (vol. 3, book 19, nos. 173, 176; vol. 6, book 60, nos. 385–386) and Abu Dawud (vol. 1, book 2, no. 1401) document the unusual prostration at the recitation of Surah 53. This strongly suggests something unique occurred.Objection 8:Shaykh al-Albani criticized the isnad (chain of transmission) for these reports.Response:According toAnswering Islam, al-Albani has been shown to contradict himself on isnad criticism. SeeAl-Albani Unveiledby Sayf ad-Din Ahmed Ibn Muhammad Amirul Islam for many examples.Objection 9:Non-Muslims bring up this story to attack Muhammad and Islam.Response:The event was not invented by non-Muslims but recorded by early Muslims. Ignoring criticism merely because it opposes one’s views is not the path of truth. Christians are called to expose false prophets out of love, desiring Muslims to turn from error and find salvation in the true Jesus Christ.Where Do We Go from Here?Muslims themselves are not unanimous on whether Satan’s words entered the Qur’an.Option 1:If Muhammad did speak as a prophet concerning the intercession of Allah’s daughters, he was a false prophet for that time.Option 2:If Muhammad never uttered the Satanic Verses, all four early biographers must have conspired in error. Some people may choose to follow something even if they believe their leader spoke Satan’s words.Either way, Islam teaches that Allah allowed his word to be substantially altered and allowed even sincere followers to be led astray. The Qur’an (Surah 43:44–45) claims all previous prophets shared the same message, and Surah 41:43 claims nothing was sent to Muhammad that was not previously sent to other prophets. Thus, either:a) Allah allowed his prior revelations to be corrupted, orb) The Qur’an is itself a corrupted message.In both cases, Islam concedes that Allah cannot be trusted to preserve his word against substantial doctrinal change.Trust in GodThe Almighty God is able to preserve His message. People should trust in God more.Trust that God has preserved His word.Surah 5:46–48 states that Jesus confirmed the Torah in his time, and that God gave the Scriptures to Jews and Christians, which could be used to discern truth even during Muhammad’s life. Surah 3:48 and 5:110–111 show Jesus had both the Torah and the Gospel. Jesus’ disciples were inspired. The Bible says, “The word of God endures forever” (Isaiah 59:21; 40:8; Psalm 119:89). God’s word was never corrupted in the past and has been preserved without major error to this day (Isaiah 55:11; 1 Peter 1:23–25; Psalm 119:89, 91, 144, 160).Trust that God desires you to know the truth and come to Him.God does not wish for anyone to perish (Ezekiel 18:23, 32; 2 Peter 3:9). All are called to believe the Gospel of Jesus Christ (2 Thessalonians 1:8).Do not put your trust in mortal men. “Do not be wise in your own eyes” (Proverbs 3:7). Instead, “Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make your paths straight” (Proverbs 3:5–6). Do you believe God can direct your ways if you acknowledge Him?Trust in Jesus: He came from God, and God’s message is preserved. Jesus is not a thief or a robber (John 10:8–10). Believe that Jesus gave His life as a ransom (Matthew 20:28), as a sin offering (Romans 8:3), by the blood He shed on the cross (Hebrews 10:19).Believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved(Acts 16:31). “…‘Whoever believes in him will not be put to shame’” (Romans 10:11). So trust God and believe He leads faithfully. He did not allow His word to be corrupted, so the Bible can be trusted. Give your life to Jesus, and He will give you peace and joy.www.MuslimHope.comwww.maxshimbaministries.orgAugust 26, 2016",

A companion of Muhammad, Amr bin Al-Aas, once asked the Prophet of Allah (peace be upon him):“O Prophet of Allah, which of your wives do you love the most?”The Prophet Muhammad replied, “Aisha.”As we read above, Muhammad loved Aisha more than all his other wives.However:Aisha, the daughter of Abu Bakr, was discovered engaging in sexual relations with Safwan bin al-Muattal.It is narrated by Ibn Hisham and by Ibn Ishaq that Aisha was caught in adultery (“zina”) with Safwan ibn al-Muattal, one of the companions of Muhammad. This event, commonly referred to as the “Safwan Incident,” took place in Medina. News of the incident spread throughout the city, prompting the Prophet of Allah to send Aisha back to her parents’ home.Ali, who was Muhammad’s cousin and the husband of his daughter Fatimah, reportedly advised Muhammad to divorce Aisha to conceal the great shame caused by the accusation of adultery.This is a highly sensitive secret among Muslims, and there is a reluctance to acknowledge that Aisha committed adultery with Safwan ibn al-Muattal, leading Muhammad to return her to her parents.If Aisha was so dearly loved by Muhammad above all his other wives, why did she decide to commit adultery with Safwan ibn al-Muattal?This was a great calamity for Muhammad and the Muslim community.Perhaps this explains why Aisha refused to bear children with Muhammad—or perhaps it was due to Muhammad’s own misconduct, including his alleged sexual relations with his female slaves (see:Islam Watch article).The Muslims of Medina, led by Abdullah bin Ubai, publicly declared that Lady Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her) had committed adultery with Safwan. When the Prophet (peace be upon him) heard these accusations, he summoned his companions to consult with them on what action to take, and some advised him to divorce her. The Prophet visited Aisha and told her:“If you are not guilty, then surely Allah will acquit you; but if you are, then seek forgiveness from your Lord.”Aisha wept and asked her parents for forgiveness for the adultery she allegedly committed with Safwan, but her parents had nothing to say in her defense.References:Ibn Sa’d,Al-Tabaqat al-Kubra, Vol. 8 (Arabic)Ibn Hisham,Sira al-Nabawiyya(Arabic)Dr. Sami Alrabaa,Karen in Saudi ArabiaSahih al-Bukhari, Chapter of Washing, narrated by Anas (Arabic)Al-Lulu wa Al-Marjan fima ittafaqa alayhi al-shaykhan: Muslim and Bukhari, Hadith No. 168; 173 (Arabic)Questions for Reflection:Why did Aisha refuse to have children with Muhammad, the Prophet of Allah, especially knowing that Muhammad loved her so dearly?How do these incidents influence our understanding of Islamic history and the character of its central figures?With all due respect to all Muslims, it is evident that this religion is filled with many oddities and contradictions.Source:www.maxshimbaministries.orgPosted on August 26, 2016For further academic discussion, these accounts should be critically examined in light of classical Islamic sources, modern scholarship, and the historical context in which they were written.",

Muhammad, whose father’s name wasAbdullah(meaning“servant of Allah”), confirmed that his father is inHell, burning in torment.These arenot my words, nor am I accusing Muhammad’s father falsely—these areMuhammad’s own words.Read the evidence here:It is reported by Anas:“Indeed, a man said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, where is my father?’ He said, ‘He is in Hell.’ When he turned away, the Prophet called him back and said, ‘Indeed, my father and your father are in Hell.’”(Sahih Muslim, Book 001, Number 0398)And the question Muslims should ask themselves is:Why was Muhammad’s father, who was a pagan, named ‘Abdullah’?SinceAbdullahmeans “servant of Allah,” this clearly shows thatthe pagans of the Jahiliyyah period(the pre-Islamic era)were already worshipping Allah—even naming their children in honor of this deity, much like the Jews named their children in honor of the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.For example:Joshua –Yahweh is salvationJotham –Yahweh is perfectJehoahaz –Yahweh has held fastHezekiah –Yahweh strengthensElisha –God is salvation, etc.The answer is clear:Allah was a pagan god worshipped before the rise of Islam. This god was the“moon god,”known asal-ilah, also calledHubal.This pagan deity was worshipped throughout the Middle East, not just by the Arabs.FURTHERMORE:Why did Muhammad admit that his father is in Hell?Where did this Abdullah (servant of Allah) get his name containing “Allah”?Does this mean that Allah—the pagan god—existed before Muhammad?Indeed, Muhammad’s grandfatherAbdul Muttalibalmostsacrificed his son Abdullahto Allah. Abdul Muttalib had vowed to sacrifice one of his sons to Allah, and when the lots were drawn, it fell on Abdullah. He prepared to kill him as an offering to Allah, but Abdullah’s uncle intervened, and instead100 camels were sacrificed in his place.It is recorded that this sacrifice took placeat the Kaaba(as we shall explore later).We are told:“The arrow showed that Abdullah was to be sacrificed. So Abdul Muttalib took the boy to the Kaaba with a knife to slaughter him. The Quraysh, his uncle from the Makhzum clan, and his brother Abu Talib tried to dissuade him. They suggested consulting a female diviner. She ordered divination arrows to be drawn between Abdullah and ten camels … finally, the number of camels reached one hundred.”(Ibn Hisham 1/151–155; Rahmat-ul-lil’alameen 2/89, 90)This is why theGod of the Biblerepeatedly warned Israel againstthe pagan practicesof the surrounding nations, especially the worship of celestial bodies—the sun, moon, and stars.For example:“And beware lest you raise your eyes to heaven, and when you see the sun, the moon, and the stars—all the host of heaven—you be drawn away and bow down to them and serve them, things that the Lord your God has allotted to all the peoples under the whole heaven.”(Deuteronomy 4:19)“If there is found among you, within any of your towns that the Lord your God is giving you, a man or woman who has done evil in the sight of the Lord your God by transgressing his covenant, and has gone and served other gods and worshiped them, or the sun or the moon or any of the host of heaven, which I have forbidden…”(Deuteronomy 17:2–3)“For he rebuilt the high places that Hezekiah his father had destroyed, and he erected altars for Baal and made an Asherah, as Ahab king of Israel had done, and worshiped all the host of heaven and served them.”(2 Kings 21:3)“And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the Lord.”(2 Kings 21:5)“He removed the idolatrous priests whom the kings of Judah had ordained to make offerings in the high places … those who made offerings to Baal, to the sun, the moon, the constellations, and all the host of the heavens.”(2 Kings 23:5)“And they shall be spread before the sun and the moon and all the host of heaven, which they have loved and served and gone after and sought and worshiped.”(Jeremiah 8:2)“The houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah—all the houses on whose roofs offerings have been made to all the host of heaven and drink offerings have been poured out to other gods—shall be defiled.”(Jeremiah 19:13)“Those who bow down on the roofs to the host of the heavens, those who bow down and swear to the Lord and yet swear by Milcom.”(Zephaniah 1:5)In570 A.D., the year Muhammad was born, a ruler of theAksumite Empire of EthiopianamedAbrahah al-Ashramruled Yemen. Out of jealousy for Mecca, where pagans made their annual pilgrimage (Hajj), he built a great church in Sana’a, hoping to attract worshipers—but failed.In anger, he decided to invade Mecca to destroy the Kaaba. He marched with a large army of elephants—hence the year became known as“The Year of the Elephant.”The Quraysh tribes united to defend the Kaaba. Abdul Muttalib (Muhammad’s grandfather) told the people to flee to the mountains while he and a few stayed near the Kaaba.But, facing Abrahah’s mighty army, Abdul Muttalib said:“The Owner of this House will protect it, and I am sure He will defend it from those who seek to destroy it and will not humiliate His servants.”Tradition says that as Abrahah advanced toward the Kaaba, flocks of birds appeared, pelting his army with stones until they were destroyed.However, note this:At that time, Islam did not yet exist, andthe Kaaba was filled with hundreds of pagan idols. So the question arises—Who was the “Owner of the House” that Abdul Muttalib referred to?Clearly, it wasthe pagan god—Allah, the moon god—whom Abdul Muttalib worshipped.The Qur’an recounts this same event inSurah Al-Fil (The Elephant) 105:1–5:“Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with the people of the elephant?Did He not make their plan go astray?And He sent upon them flocks of birds,Striking them with stones of baked clay,And made them like eaten straw.”But this eventtook place during pagan times, long before Islam existed. Abdul Muttalib, a servant of a pagan god, spoke of the “Lord of the House” protecting the Kaaba.So who was this “Lord” that the Qur’an refers to? Could there have been two different gods working together—the Allah of Muhammad and the Allah of Abdul Muttalib?Impossible. Abdul Muttalib did not know Muhammad’s Allah. Therefore,the only logical conclusionis that the samepagan moon godworshipped by Abdul Muttalib was the one who “protected” the Kaaba.Thus, this Qur’anic story does not refer to a new god—but to the same old pagan deity.In conclusion:The Kaaba is apagan shrine.Muhammad’s father isin Hell.All Muslims who go on pilgrimagefollow pagan practices.Allah is apagan god.Islam is apagan religion, proven by Muhammad’s own admission that his father is in Hell.Therefore, I invite you to believe in theLiving God, ourSavior Jesus Christ.God bless you greatly.By Max Shimba,Servant of Jesus ChristFor Max Shimba Ministries Org©2016 Max Shimba Ministries Org.

These claims have been made in their religious sermons without substantial evidence to support their claims.Today, I will respond to these claims using the Bible and the Quran as follows:JESUS NEVER DECLARED THE SHAHADAAccording to Islamic law, for one to be a Muslim, they must declare the shahada. Jesus did not say the SHAHADA (La ilaha illallah), and there is no biblical or Quranic evidence that Jesus said the SHAHADA. Therefore, Jesus was not a Muslim.JESUS DID NOT WORSHIP ALLAHJesus never prayed to or worshipped \"Allah,\" but according to the Bible, Jesus prayed to His Father, John 17:1 These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee: The Quran and Islam acknowledge that Allah is not the Father, and there is not a single verse that calls Allah Father. Jesus was not a Muslim.JESUS DID NOT PRAY FACING MECCAJesus never prostrated himself facing Mecca, a requirement in praying to or worshipping \"ALLAH.\" Quran 2:149. Whencesoever thou comest forth turn thy face toward the Inviolable Place of Worship; and wheresoever ye may be (O Muslims) turn your faces toward it (when ye pray) so that men may have no argument against you save such of them as do injustice - Fear them not, but fear Me! - and so that I may complete My grace upon you, and that ye may be guided. 150. Whencesoever ye cometh forth turn your face toward the Inviolable Place of Worship. And wheresoever ye may be (O Muslims) turn your faces toward it so that people shall have no accusation against you, except such of them as do wrong; fear them not, but fear Me; and that I may complete My favor upon you, and that ye may be guided aright.Now let's read about how Jesus prayed in the Bible. Where did He look while praying?Jesus prayed looking up to Heaven. Read: Mark 6:41 And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all.In the above verse, we have evidence that Jesus looked up to Heaven where His Father is, and not towards Mecca.JESUS DID NOT TEACH ABOUT THE KAABAJesus never mentioned or taught His disciples about the \"KAABA,\" which is done by Muslims and was taught by Muhammad, the prophet of Allah.JESUS DID NOT FAST DURING RAMADANJesus did not fast during Ramadan, which is part of Islam to fast during Ramadan every year. Quran 2:183, O ye who believe! Fasting is prescribed to you, as it was prescribed to those before you, that ye may (learn) self-restraint.There is not a single part in the Bible where we read that Jesus commanded His followers to fast every year, but we read that in Matthew 6:16-18: Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. 17 But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face; 18 That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.JESUS DID NOT ENGAGE IN JIHADJesus did not engage in Jihad as every Muslim is commanded to engage in Jihad. Quran 2:216. Warfare is ordained for you, though it is hateful unto you; but it may happen that ye hate a thing which is good for you, and it may happen that ye love a thing which is bad for you. Allah knoweth, ye know not.But Jesus said the following about fighting: John 18:36 Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.In the above verse, Jesus teaches us that His Kingdom is not of this world but Heaven, so He cannot engage in Jihad as Allah commands Muslims. Jesus was not a Muslim, and He did not engage in Jihad.JESUS SAID TO LOVE YOUR ENEMIES, WHILE ALLAH SAYS HATE CHRISTIANS AND JEWSJesus did not hate those who opposed Him, but He loved them and prayed for them, contrary to Allah's commands to Muslims. Read Matthew 5:44 But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you.Now let's see how Allah shows hatred towards His followers. Quran 5:51. O ye who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians for friends. They are friends one to another. He among you who taketh them for friends is (one) of them. Lo! Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk.JESUS DID NOT TEACH TO STONE ADULTERERSJesus did not stone people to death, nor did He teach that adulterers should be stoned, as is taught in the Islamic religion. Read John 8:6 This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not. 7 So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.But in Islam, we read about Muhammad ordering the stoning of an adulterer: Volume 2, Book 23, Number 413: Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar:A Jew brought to the Prophet two men who had committed sodomy with each other. The Prophet ordered both of them to be killed near the place of offering the funeral prayers beside the mosque.Therefore, Jesus was not a Muslim, and He did not stone adulterers, but we read about Muhammad stoning people and teaching the stoning of adulterers in Islam.JESUS DID NOT TEACH PEOPLE TO PERFORM ABLUTION BEFORE PRAYINGJesus did not follow the ritual of washing or performing ablution before praying, as Muslims do every day. Read about Jesus in Matthew 15:2-11. But Allah practices the rituals of washing and ablution before worshipping Him. Quran 5:6. O ye who believe! When ye prepare for prayer, wash your faces, and your hands (and arms) to the elbows; Rub your heads (with water); and (wash) your feet to the ankles. If ye are in a state of ceremonial impurity, bathe your whole body. But if ye are ill, or on a journey, or one of you cometh from offices of nature, or ye have been in contact with women, and ye find no water, then take for yourselves clean sand or earth, and rub therewith your faces and hands, Allah doth not wish to place you in a difficulty, but to make you clean, and to complete His favor to you, that ye may be grateful.Jesus did not perform ablution before praying to His Father as in Islam. Jesus was not a Muslim.JESUS NEVER USED THE TERMS \"SAW\" OR \"PBUH\"Jesus never told people to write abbreviations like \"SAW\" and \"PBUH\" after mentioning their names, unlike Allah and His Prophet, who teach to say so in Islam after mentioning the names of Prophets and Messengers.Dear readers, today we have read about Jesus and His character and teachings, all of which contradict the laws and customs of Islam.It is my hope that this publication will help you understand that Jesus did not follow Islamic customs and did not worship Allah.God bless you allIn His ServiceI am Max Shimba, a servant of Jesus ChristCopyright © Max Shimba Ministries 2013www.maxshimbaministries.orgJuly 23, 2016",

    "full_content": "I REFUSE TO BE A MUSLIM BECAUSE ALLAH WILL ENTER HELL LIKE CREATURES OF SINBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaMax Shimba Ministries Org – Tuesday, May 24, 2016IntroductionIn today’s world, there are numerous paths of hope being preached. Eternal joy and Heaven are spoken of everywhere. Yet despite this universal yearning, religions, philosophies, and ideologies diverge greatly in their interpretations of eternal hope. Each tradition claims to hold the truth, believing itself to be the sure foundation of salvation.Among these divergent beliefs is the Islamic doctrine as articulated in the Quran. Specifically,Surat Maryam 19:71–72declares:“There is not one of you but will pass over it [Hell]; this is with your Lord a decree which must be accomplished. Then We shall save those who used to fear Allah and were dutiful to Him, and We shall leave the wrongdoers therein, humbled to their knees.”This Quranic passage implies thatevery person, including Muslims, is alreadypredestinedto enter Hell. This is claimed to be Allah’s irrevocable judgment, although a promise of eventual salvation is offered to the God-fearing. But this raises a critical theological and moral question:Is this doctrine truly credible or divinely just?The Quran’s Position on Hell and Divine JudgmentThe Quran further supports this idea inSurah Ghafir (40:60):“And your Lord said: Call upon Me, I will respond to you. Verily! Those who scorn My worship, they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!”It is alarming that Allah, the supreme being in Islam, states not only that people will be condemned to Hell but that even those who call upon Him can fall into Hell’s torment due to arrogance or misdeeds. If this decree is universal and binding, then all Muslims are effectively doomed from the outset—even while professing to follow Allah.This forms one of the theological inconsistencies that makes it difficult for me, as a Christian, to embrace a religion whose god has alreadydecreed Hellas the default destiny for all his followers, only to later \"rescue\" some from within the fire.Does Allah Literally Enter Hell?Beyond predestining Muslims for Hell, certain Islamic traditions contain even more startling assertions. InSahih al-Bukhari, Volume 6, Book 60, Hadith 371, it is reported:Narrated Anas: The Prophet (ﷺ) said, “People will be thrown into Hell (Jahannam), and it will keep asking, ‘Are there any more (to come)?’ until the Lord of the worlds places His Foot over it. Then it will say, ‘Enough! Enough!’”This hadith implies thatAllah Himself will physically place His Foot into Hellto stop it from demanding more souls. This anthropomorphic portrayal of God raises troubling questions. If Hell remains unfilled until Allah steps into it, where in the Quran or Hadith is it stated that Allah later removes His Foot or exits Hell? This further challenges Islamic notions of transcendence and divine separation from sin and punishment.The Biblical Contrast: No Entry to Heaven Through HellThe Christian Scriptures paint a wholly different picture of final judgment. InLuke 16:24, the parable of the rich man and Lazarus illustrates the finality of one’s eternal destination:“So he called to him, ‘Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire.’”This text emphasizes thatthere is a fixed chasmbetween Hell and Heaven. No one traverses from the torment of Hell into the joy of Heaven. Unlike the Quran, which implies a temporary punishment followed by salvation,the Bible teaches that judgment is final and irreversible.Furthermore,Proverbs 16:25warns:“There is a way that seems right to a man, but in the end it leads to death.”This confirms that not all spiritual paths lead to life. Some, even though seemingly moral or religious, end in destruction. In this light, the Islamic path, which begins with the assurance of Hell, contradicts the Christian doctrine of immediate redemption through faith in Christ.The Christian Way: Jesus Christ as the Only Path to Eternal LifeWhy, then, should I, as a Christian, adopt a religion whose divine system begins by condemning its followers to Hell? The Bible gives a better way—a Living Way—in the person of Jesus Christ. InJohn 14:5–6, Thomas said:“Lord, we don’t know where you are going, so how can we know the way?”Jesus answered, “I am the Way and the Truth and the Life. No one comes to the Father except through me.”In the Christian worldview,Jesus is not just a prophet, but the exclusive mediator of salvation.He is the Way—not through fire, but through grace.2 Corinthians 4:3–4further clarifies that many have been spiritually blinded by the \"god of this age\" (Satan), preventing them from seeing the light of the Gospel:“Even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing. The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers...”The second step, after recognizing that Jesus is the Way, the Truth, and the Life, is tobelieve in Him and confess Him:“If you declare with your mouth, ‘Jesus is Lord,’ and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.” – Romans 10:9–10It is through such faith and confession that one receiveslegal redemption—taking our share in Christ's atoning work on the Cross.Final Appeal: Choose Life Through ChristMany people know of Jesus, and may even speak His name, but have not surrendered their lives to Him. They remain in religious traditions that do not lead to salvation.Matthew 10:32–33reminds us:“Whoever acknowledges me before others, I will also acknowledge before my Father in heaven. But whoever disowns me before others, I will disown before my Father in heaven.”Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is indeed the onlyWay, Truth, and Life. There is no salvation outside of Him. When you believe in Jesus and obey His Word, you receive peace, eternal life, and joy—not only in this world, but also in the world to come.ConclusionThese are a few of the many reasons why Ireject Islam. It is a system that already condemns its followers to Hell by divine decree. On the other hand,Jesus Christ offers eternal life freely to all who believe in Him. I encourage you to come to Jesus Christ today.“Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts.” – Hebrews 3:15Dr. Maxwell ShimbaServant of Jesus ChristMax Shimba Ministries Org",

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba | Shimba Ministries InternationalOriginally Published: Sunday, May 22, 2016AbstractThis essay presents a theological critique of gender inequality in the Islamic vision of paradise as depicted in the Qur'an. The author contrasts the Christian vision of salvation through Jesus Christ—characterized by equality, dignity, and spiritual unity across genders—with the Qur'anic depiction of paradise, which appears to favor men and marginalize women, especially those of African descent. The central argument is posed in the form of three theological questions directed at African Muslim women, aiming to stimulate scripturally grounded dialogue and invite reconsideration of the claims made in Islamic eschatology regarding gender.Introduction: The Promise of Christ vs. the Rewards of IslamBefore presenting my theological inquiry, I wish to share the promises of Jesus Christ—who lived over 570 years before the Prophet Muhammad—as they relate to gender equality and the afterlife. Jesus Christ spoke of a kingdom not built upon earthly desires or human hierarchies, but one where men and women are equal inheritors of divine glory:Luke 20:34-36Jesus replied, “The people of this age marry and are given in marriage. But those who are considered worthy of taking part in the age to come and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage, and they can no longer die; for they are like the angels. They are God’s children, since they are children of the resurrection.”The teaching of Jesus emphasizes agenderless equalityin the Kingdom of God, where marital status is irrelevant and all are like angels. Jesus offers a future where both men and women are considered co-heirs of the divine promise, regardless of race or status.Galatians 3:27-29For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.In this Kingdom—one of righteousness and justice—none are prioritized based on gender. Even the patriarchs of the faith, such as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, await the company of both men and women who have trusted in Christ:Matthew 8:11“I say to you that many will come from the east and the west, and will take their places at the feast with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.”Those who practiced unrighteousness, regardless of status or religious affiliation, will be cast out, for Christ demands holiness:Luke 13:27-29“I don’t know you or where you come from. Away from me, all you evildoers!” There will be weeping there, and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but you yourselves thrown out.People will come from east and west and north and south, and will take their places at the feast in the kingdom of God.The Qur’anic Description of Paradise: A Male-Centric VisionLet us now consider the Islamic depiction of paradise, as revealed by Muhammad in the Qur’an. Below are selected passages from the Qur’an that outline the rewards promised primarily tomalebelievers.Surah Ar-Rahman 55:56“In them (Gardens) will be maidens with restrained glances, whom no man or jinn has ever touched.”Here, paradise offers virginal women—never touched by man or jinn—as companions to male believers. These women are not earthly women, not those who have lived, suffered, or borne children. This implicitly excludes the average African Muslim woman who may have been married, widowed, or abused.Surah At-Tur 52:20“Reclining on thrones lined up, We will marry them to fair women with wide, lovely eyes.”Surah As-Saffat 37:48–49“And with them will be companions with beautiful, big, and lustrous eyes, like preserved pearls.”These descriptions suggest that:Only specific types of women—fair-skinned and with large eyes—will populate paradise.These women have not been touched by men or jinn.These women are createdfor men; there is no reciprocal promise to believing women.In these verses, there is no mention of African women—especially not women with African features—or any promise that women themselves will receive partners created for their pleasure.Three Theological Questions for African Muslim WomenBased on these Qur’anic promises, I pose three scripturally focused questions to my Muslim sisters, especially those of African heritage:Is there any verse in the Qur’an that specifically promises thatyou—as African Muslim women—will be married in paradise?Is there any verse that promises thatyouwill receive male partners who have never touched women or jinn?Is there any verse that promises thatyouwill be transformed to have large eyes like goblets or resemble preserved eggs, so that you may be equally glorified like the fair maidens promised to men?If the answer to all these questions is “No,” then I humbly and without hostility invite you to examine the teachings of Jesus Christ, who offers an eternal kingdom without gender bias, without racial discrimination, and without favoritism. In His kingdom,men and women are co-heirs, andall who believe in Him—regardless of background—shall be saved.Conclusion: The Invitation to Christ's Egalitarian KingdomThe vision of paradise in the Christian gospel is not rooted in carnal desire, nor does it elevate one gender over another. It is a Kingdom based on faith, love, and holiness—a Kingdom where neither African women nor any other people group is forgotten or marginalized.“Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.”—Matthew 5:8This message is not shared out of antagonism, but out of sincere love for truth and justice. Therefore, I kindly ask Muslim scholars and believers alike: please respond not with emotion, but withevidencefrom the Qur’an—if it exists.Until then, I affirm with peace:Come to Jesus, who welcomes all.Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Ministries InternationalMay 22, 2016Watakabahu.",

    "full_content": "Muhammad’s “Satanic Portion” and the Four Surgeries: A Critical AnalysisIntroductionThe biography (Sīra) and hadith literature regarding the life of Muhammad, the founder of Islam, contain a remarkable narrative that is rarely discussed in mainstream Islamic apologetics. The narrative asserts that Muhammad underwent multiple “surgeries” by the angel Jibril (Gabriel), during which a portion described as the “share of Satan” was removed from his heart. This account, referenced in authoritative Islamic sources, raises significant theological and philosophical questions about the nature of prophethood and the concept of sinlessness (ismah) in Islam.The Four Surgeries in the Life of MuhammadAccording to the traditional sources, the Prophet Muhammad was subjected to the removal of the “share of Satan” onfour separate occasions:At the age of threeAt the age of tenAt the age of fortyAt the age of forty-three, prior to the event of Isra’ and Mi’raj (the Night Journey and Ascension)Primary Source: The Hadith of Anas bin MalikA narration from Anas bin Malik reports:“The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) was playing with other boys when the Angel Jibril (Gabriel) came to him, took him, laid him down, split open his chest, and removed his heart. He then extracted a portion of clotted blood and said, ‘This is the share of Satan in you.’ He washed (the heart) in a golden vessel filled with Zamzam water, then returned it to its place and sealed it up.”(Reference: Sahih Muslim, Vol. 1, p. 147, Hadith No. 713)Theological Questions Arising from the NarrativeThis account raises severalcritical questions:1.How did Satan’s portion enter Muhammad’s heart?The narrative presupposes that a portion belonging to Satan resided in Muhammad’s heart, thus necessitating a surgical intervention by Gabriel. This contradicts the Islamic doctrine of the innate purity (fitrah) of prophets.2.Since when can Satan be expelled or cleansed by washing with water?The notion that the influence of Satan can be physically removed by washing with Zamzam water anthropomorphizes Satan and suggests a material impurity, which is inconsistent with both Islamic and Christian demonology.Comparative Analysis: Jesus and MuhammadIn a hadith reported by Abu Huraira, Muhammad said:“Every human being is touched by Satan at birth. Satan touches the side of every child of Adam as he is born, except for Mary and her son (Jesus). Satan attempted to touch them but found a veil [preventing him].”(Referenced in Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim)This contrast is significant. According to the hadith,Jesus (Isa ibn Maryam)is uniquely exempt from Satan’s touch, while even Muhammad himself was not spared. This raises a fundamental question for Muslim readers:If Jesus was never touched by Satan, and Muhammad needed four supernatural surgeries to remove Satan’s share, should not Jesus be recognized as superior in purity and spiritual status?ConclusionThe hadith regarding Muhammad’s “satanic portion” and its removal by Gabriel introduces serious theological difficulties regarding the Islamic view of prophetic purity and the nature of evil. The peculiar idea of “washing” Satan with Zamzam water diminishes the spiritual gravity of the struggle against evil, reducing it to a physical or ritual act.For those seeking a prophet untouched by Satan, as even the Islamic tradition concedes, it is Jesus Christ alone who fits that description.With respect,Max Shimba, servant of Jesus ChristFor Dr. Maxwell Shimba Ministries OrgMAX SHIMBA MINISTRIES ORG ©2016.

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Servant of Jesus ChristMax Shimba Ministries Org ©2016. All Rights ReservedPublished: Sunday, May 1, 2016IntroductionThis article seeks to explore a theological dilemma rooted in Islamic scripture, namely, the Quranic assertion that Allah cannot have a son without engaging in a marital relationship. We will investigate this claim using direct references from the Quran and analyze the internal inconsistencies it presents when compared to natural processes and Biblical narratives. The theological critique offered herein aims to provoke deep reflection on the Islamic understanding of divine capacity and limitation.Quranic Assertion: A Limitation on Divine Power?We begin with a verse from the Quran,Surat Al-Anʿām (6:101), which was revealed in Mecca. It reads:“He is the Originator of the heavens and the earth. How can He have a son when He does not have a consort (wife)? He created all things and He is, of all things, Knowing.”— (Qur'an 6:101)This verse explicitly questions the possibility of Allah having a son in the absence of a wife, implying a biological limitation that applies to him as a deity. Herein lies the theological dilemma: how can a being who claims to be theCreator of all thingsbe limited by the need for a spouse to produce offspring?If Allah is indeed omnipotent and the creator of all natural processes, including reproduction, then logically he should transcend such biological limitations. By asserting that he cannot have a son without a wife, the verse indirectly attributes to Allah the limitations of created beings—an argument that undermines the concept of divine omnipotence.Natural Phenomena That Contradict the ClaimLet us examine nature, which Allah claims to have created, and assess whether reproduction necessarily requires two counterparts. We find thatcertain trees can reproduce without mating, and in human biology,cells divide through a process called mitosis, which does not require a male or female counterpart.Mitosis is asexual reproduction occurring in four stages:Prophase, Metaphase, Anaphase, and Telophase.This process leads to the creation of new cells without the union of two distinct entities. (See:NCBI - Mitosis and Cell Cycle;Genetics Home Reference - Cell Division)If Allah claims to have created these systems that function without the need for sexual union, it is theologically inconsistent for him to require a wife to have a son. This contradiction challenges the core claim of Allah’s omnipotence.The Virgin Birth of Mary as a Case StudyThe story of Mary (Maryam) and the virgin birth of Jesus (Isa) in the Quran further complicates the issue. According toSurat Aal Imran (3:45, 47):“When the angels said: O Mary, indeed Allah gives you good tidings of a Word from Him, whose name will be the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary — distinguished in this world and the Hereafter and among those brought near to Allah.”(3:45)“She said: My Lord, how will I have a child when no man has touched me? He said: Thus it is — Allah creates what He wills. When He decrees a matter, He only says to it, ‘Be,’ and it is.”(3:47)In this passage, Allah claims that He can create without the need for human agency, simply by commanding,“Be!”(Kun fa-yakūn). If this is truly the case, thenwhy does Allah in Surat Al-Anʿām 6:101 deny the possibility of having a son unless He has a consort?This internal contradiction in the Quranic narrative is both theological and logical. Mary is granted the divine power to conceive without intercourse, yet Allah cannot have a son unless he has a wife. If Allah gave Mary the ability, why could He not apply that same creative power to Himself?The Quran’s Own Confession of InferiorityFurthermore,Surat Al-Lail (92:1–3)presents an even more concerning theological implication:“By the night when it covers, by the day when it appears, and by He who created the male and the female…”— (Qur'an 92:1–3)This verse raises a significant question: Who is being referenced as the one who created male and female? If Allah is swearing by the one who created male and female, is he referring to himself or another being?Swearing by a higher authority or creator would implysubordination, which is incompatible with divinity. A true God does not swear by another creator, for He is the Creator. Therefore, this passage may inadvertently indicate that Allah is not the true originator of life — a severe theological error in Islamic doctrine.Theological Questions That EmergeThe above analysis invites several crucial theological inquiries:If Allah is the Creator of all things, why does he claim incapacity to have a son without a wife?How is it that Mary can have a son without a man, but Allah cannot have a son without a woman?If Allah gave Mary that divine ability, why could He not grant it to Himself?Why does Allah swear by someone else who created male and female if He is supposedly the sole Creator?These inconsistencies reveal a profound theological weakness in the Quranic representation of Allah’s nature and power.ConclusionIn conclusion, the Quran portrays Allah as a deity bound by human-like biological constraints, which is incompatible with the notion of absolute divine omnipotence. If Allah cannot have a son without a consort, and yet enables Mary to conceive without a husband, this not only exposes an inconsistency but also undermines his claimed sovereignty.True divinity, as revealed in the person of Jesus Christ, transcends all natural and biological limits. Jesus was born of a virgin, not through sexual union, but by the power of the Holy Spirit — the true manifestation of divine omnipotence.May God bless you as you seek the truth.— Dr. Maxwell Shimba,Servant of Jesus ChristMax Shimba Ministries Org",

THEREFORE, ALLAH, MUHAMMAD, AND HIS RELIGION REPRESENT 666Dear Reader,In this tract, we will learn about theBeastmentioned in the Book of Revelation in the Holy Bible.InRevelation 13:18, a prophecy is made about a beast whose name will number 666. Bible scholars (theologians) have differed in the interpretation of this verse.The primary passage in the Bible that mentions the “mark of the beast” isRevelation 13:15–18. Other references can be found inRevelation 14:9, 11; 15:2; 16:2; 19:20; and 20:4.This mark is used as a seal for the followers of the Antichrist and the false prophet (the spokesperson of the Antichrist). The false prophet (the second beast) is the one who causes people to receive this mark. The mark is specifically placed on the hand or forehead—not a card that someone will carry.Before openly declaring who this “beast” with the number “666” is, let me first clarify two key points: First, know that the book of Revelation is a prophetic book.The Beast – Revelation 13:1–18Everything is identified by its characteristics and actions. A name alone cannot verify a person or thing, as names are often shared or changed. Therefore, in this article, I will not waste time researching names as those theologically bankrupt scholars do. Instead, I will interpret the characteristics mentioned in Revelation so that every reader with a calm mind can discern for themselves who this beast is.Let us first understand where this beast gets such great power. As is known, the world is currently under the dominion of Satan (see John 12:31, 16:11; 1 John 5:19, etc.). Therefore, the beast has been given authority by Satan, the “Dragon” (see Revelation 13:1–10, 12:7–9). Thus, this \"Beast\" is Satan's agent on earth. He will use all means—force, persuasion, etc.—to cause humanity to rebel against Almighty God and obey his master (Satan).Characteristics of the BeastHe will be praised, obeyed, and feared by all the people of the earth.“…The whole world was astonished and followed the beast. People worshiped the dragon because he had given authority to the beast, and they also worshiped the beast and asked, ‘Who is like the beast? Who can wage war against it?’” (Revelation 13:3–4)Leaders of nations (presidents, kings, sultans, etc.) will rely on him and give him their power and authority.They will govern according to the will of the “beast.” Therefore, they will be agents of the beast in their own countries—and thus, also agents of the “Dragon” (Satan).“…The ten horns you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but who for one hour will receive authority as kings along with the beast. They have one purpose and will give their power and authority to the beast.” (Revelation 17:12–13)ALLAH APPOINTS A PROPHET “BEAST”Surat An-Naml 27:82–“And when the Word is fulfilled against them, We shall bring out from the earth a beast to them, which will speak to them because mankind did not believe with assurance in Our signs.”Allah says He will send a Beast who will speak to the people.The Quran is the number 666. Let me show you how 666 is embedded within the Quran.First, understand that the number SIX is a fixed number in mathematics. It is the only number that when you add or multiply the first three numbers, you still get 6.1 + 2 + 3 = 61 × 2 × 3 = 6Surah 111contains100 letters, and theGematrical Valueof the Arabic letterQafis100.Surah 111has6 verses. 111 × 6 =666→ The Quran.Surah 6:111→ when multiplied gives you a total of666in the Qaf code table.Muslims say “Allahu Akbar”111 timesin their daily contact prayers.If you add the digits of 666 (6+6+6), you get18, and the number111is composed of 100 + 10 + 1.Now consider this:Surah18has111 verses, and 18 × 111 =1998→ 666 × 3.(Reference:http://freerepublic.com/focus/f-chat/1971221/posts)THE SECRET HAS BEEN REVEALED! WE NOW KNOW THAT ALLAH IS THE ONE WHO WILL BRING THE ANTICHRIST (666), AND ALLAH CONFIRMS IN SURAT AN-NAML THAT HE HAS ALREADY APPOINTED A PROPHET WHO IS A BEAST, AND THAT THIS PROPHET RECITES MUHAMMAD’S QURAN.If indeed the Quran is the word of Allah and He sent it down, then today we know that Allah is not only the one who will bring the Antichrist, but thatAllah and Muhammad themselves are the Antichrist.Why do Muslims say:\"Islam will dominate the world\"?Why did Allah create a Beast and appoint it as a Prophet?Surely, there is a great mystery in Islam, which stands against Christ.Come to Jesus, who is theOnly Way to Heaven.God bless you all.—I am Max Shimba, servant of Jesus ChristFor Max Shimba Ministries Org©2016 MAX SHIMBA MINISTRIES ORG.

However, that claim is contradicted by several verses in the Quran.“When we heard the guidance, we believed in it; and whoever believes in his Lord will not fear any loss or being burdened with the sins (of another).” (Quran 72:13)The Quran says that one who believes in the Almighty God should not fear being burdened with the sins of another.But, are there people who can bear the sins of others?Read Quran Surah An-Nahl (16), verse 25:“There are those who mislead others so that they will bear the burdens of those they misled on the Day of Judgment, and also carry their own burdens. Surely, evil is the load they carry!”Allah, through the Quran, tells all Muslims that this burden of sin they carry is extremely evil and they have been misled to bear it until the Day of Judgment.NOW, if carrying sin on the Day of Judgment is extremely evil, where can we offload that burden?READ Psalm 55:22“Cast your burden on the LORD, and He shall sustain you; He shall never permit the righteous to be moved.”THE BIBLE RESPONDS TO MUSLIMS, telling them to cast their burden on the LORD. That’s why all Christians have realized this truth.CONTINUE READING John 13:13“You call Me Teacher and Lord, and you say well, for so I am.”Jesus says,\"You call me Teacher and Lord, and you say well.\"Now continue reading:Jeremiah 10:10“But the LORD is the true God; He is the living God and the everlasting King. At His wrath the earth will tremble, and the nations shall not be able to endure His indignation.”Jeremiah 10:10 responds to Muslims thatthis LORD is the true God.Now Muslims wonder how Jesus can be God and still die on the cross. Let us continue:Quran 55:29“All that are in the heavens and the earth ask of Him. Every day He is (engaged) in some affair.”The Quran itself responds clearly thateverything in heaven and on earth asks from Him.Dear Muslim, are you still wondering?Now look at what happened and what was fulfilled on the cross:READ 1 Peter 3:18–19“For Christ also suffered once for sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive by the Spirit, by whom also He went and preached to the spirits in prison.”The Word of God saysHis body was put to death but His spirit was made alive.Now there is no longer room for confusion because what was killed was onlyHis body, butHis spirit was not killed.Scripture saysGod is Spirit, so what was put to death was just His body—His Spirit was made alive.1 Timothy 6:15–16“...He who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings and Lord of lords, who alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen or can see, to whom be honor and everlasting power. Amen.”Now we see that Jesus made a good confession.READ verse 13 of 1 Timothy 6:“I urge you in the sight of God who gives life to all things, and before Christ Jesus who witnessed the good confession before Pontius Pilate...”For further evidence, read:Luke 18:31Then He took the twelve aside and said to them, “Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of Man will be accomplished.”BUT, our Muslim brothers saythe cross is the symbol of Satan. Let's begin with:Quran 7:16“Satan said: Because You have put me in error, I will sit in wait for them on Your Straight Path.”SATAN TELLS ALLAH: “Because You led me astray, I will surely lie in wait for them onYour Straight Path.”SATAN SWEARS TO STAND ON THE STRAIGHT PATH OF ALLAH.Now what is thisStraight Path of Allahwhere Satan swore to sit?Quran 6:126“And this (Quran) is the Straight Path of your Lord. We have detailed the verses for people who take heed.”So,SATAN IS SITTING ON THE STRAIGHT PATH, which isISLAM, as shown inQuran 7:16.Because Satan has taken his seat on the Straight Path, it meansSatan has a religion, or do you disagree?MUHAMMAD CONVERTS SATAN TO ISLAMAccording to the book“The Origin of the Jinn”, page 20, it says:“It is unfortunate that Adam and Eve did not make efforts to enable Satan and his offspring to ask forgiveness from Allah. It was only the Prophet Muhammad who converted Satan to Islam.”This is not surprising, because we already read in Surah Al-An'am thatSatan resides on the Straight Path of Allah. And that Straight Path isIslam, Quran 6:126:“And this religion of Islam is the Straight Path of your Lord.”Dear brethren, once again we’ve learned thatSatan is the leader of the religion of Islam.Satan is the one who sits on the Straight Path and has become a Muslim, as we read inThe Origin of the Jinn, page 20.This is yet another disaster in the religion of Allah, where we now understand thatSatan sits on the Straight Path and was converted to Islam by Muhammad.God bless you abundantly.I am Max Shimba, a servant of Jesus Christ,For Max Shimba Ministries OrgMAX SHIMBA MINISTRIES ORG ©2016.

It argues, based on Qur’anic exegesis and Islamic jurisprudence, that the institution of the Kadhi Court lacks explicit Qur’anic authorization. Furthermore, it raises constitutional, legal, and human rights concerns about its implementation in a secular state like Tanzania, especially concerning the treatment of women, inter-sectarian disagreements, and judicial standards.IntroductionThe call for Kadhi Courts by some Tanzanian Muslims has sparked considerable debate concerning the legitimacy and compatibility of such courts within the nation's legal and constitutional framework. This paper critically examines the doctrinal basis for Kadhi Courts in Islam, specifically within the Qur'an, and explores the broader socio-political and ethical implications of introducing such institutions.1. Qur’anic Silence on the Kadhi CourtContrary to popular belief among many Muslims advocating for Kadhi Courts, the Qur’andoes not contain a single versethat mandates or even suggests the establishment of such courts. Nowhere in the Qur’an does Allah command Muslims to seek justice specifically through aKadhior a religious judicial system resembling a Kadhi Court.This absence invites important theological reflection:If Allah did not prescribe such courts, why do some Muslims insist on their institutionalization?Is it justifiable to construct a religious judiciary in Allah’s name where the Qur’an remains silent?2. Critical Questions on the Legitimacy and Function of the Kadhi CourtA. Who Appoints the Chief Kadhi and Kadhis?Where in the Qur’an is the appointment of a Chief Kadhi or subordinate Kadhis outlined? Who possesses the divine authority to make such appointments?No verse exists which grants any person or institution the power to appoint a Chief Kadhi.B. What Are the Qualifications for a Kadhi?The Qur’an does not define any qualifications—educational, moral, legal, or religious—for someone to serve as a Kadhi.Where are the verses outlining the academic or spiritual requirements for such an office?C. Legal Training and Secular Law ConflictsMost individuals appointed to Kadhi positions lack training in secular legal principles, including the Evidence Act and the Civil Procedure Act. What legal framework will these untrained officers use to ensure justice? And more importantly, how will their decisions align with the Tanzanian Constitution?D. Sunni and Shia DivisionsTanzania is home to both Sunni and Shia Muslims. Since these sects differ significantly in theology and jurisprudence, how will the system address the following:Will Kadhis be appointed from both sects?Will there be two different Kadhi Courts?How will inter-sectarian disputes be resolved?E. Gender Discrimination and Legal InjusticeThe application of Islamic family law, which heavily influences Kadhi Court decisions, raises grave concerns about gender equity. For instance:Marriage and Divorce:Only men are granted the unilateral right to initiate divorce (ṭalāq), per Surah 2:228–232 and Surah 65:1–7.Inheritance and Testimony:Women receive half the inheritance of men (Surah 4:11), and the testimony of two women is equal to one man’s (Surah 2:282).Domestic Discipline:Men are permitted to “strike” their wives lightly (Surah 4:34).Such injunctions are not only incompatible with modern constitutional law but also violate international standards on gender equality.3. Constitutional and Ethical IncompatibilityThe proposed Kadhi Courts pose a serious threat to the secular and democratic values enshrined in the Tanzanian Constitution. These courts:Violate the principle ofequal protection under the law.Institutionalizereligious discrimination, as they cater only to Muslims.Underminejudicial impartiality, replacing legal expertise with religious interpretation.Open the door toparallel legal systems, risking legal fragmentation and community division.How then will Muslims balance allegiance to national law with adherence to a religious court that contradicts both the Constitution and the fundamental rights it protects?4. Theological Warning: Inventing for Allah What He Did Not CommandEstablishing the Kadhi Court in Allah’s name, without His explicit command, is theologically dangerous. The Qur’an itself warns against attributing to Allah what He did not say:“Do not say about what your tongues describe falsely: ‘This is lawful, and this is unlawful,’ so as to fabricate lies against Allah. Indeed, those who fabricate lies against Allah will never prosper.”—Surah An-Nahl (16:116)Why do Muslims feel the need to “assist” Allah by introducing structures He never prescribed? To invent a court system in His name, when He is self-sufficient and almighty, is not only baseless—it is a form of theological innovation (bid‘ah), a grave sin in Islamic doctrine.5. Christian Invitation: True Freedom through ChristIn contrast to the legalistic systems of Islamic jurisprudence, Christianity offersfreedom from the bondage of the law through the grace of Jesus Christ. The Bible teaches:“For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.”—2 Corinthians 5:21And again:“For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so also by one Man’s obedience many will be made righteous.”—Romans 5:19The Mosaic law, much like Shariah, couldreveal sin but could not redeem from it. It is only through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ that true righteousness and spiritual transformation are made possible.“For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and death.”—Romans 8:2ConclusionThe proposal to institutionalize Kadhi Courts in Tanzania lacksQur’anic mandate, posesconstitutional dangers, and is fraught withtheological and ethical inconsistencies. As such, it must be rejected not only on legal grounds but on spiritual grounds as well.Instead of returning to legalism and religious stratification, Muslims are invited to embrace the grace and freedom found in Jesus Christ, who alone offers the righteousness of God apart from the law.Endnote“And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whoever believes in Him may have eternal life.”—John 3:14-15Come to Christ and be set free—not only from sin but from legal systems that can never save.© Max Shimba Ministries 2013Translated and Expanded by Max Shimba Ministries Org, 2025All rights reserved.",

Al-Hasan saw no harm in an owner kissing or fondling his slave girl with desire.**Ibn ‘Umar said, ‘If a slave girl eligible for sexual relations is gifted to another man, or sold, or freed, her former master must not have intercourse with her until she has had one menstrual period, to ensure she is not pregnant. This is not necessary for virgins.’‘Ata said, ‘There is no harm in fondling a pregnant slave girl with desire without intercourse. Allah said: \"Except with their wives or those their right hands possess—for (then) they are not to be blamed.\"’\"Footnote: “Pregnant and by someone else, not the current owner.”–Bukhari, Volume 3, Book 34 (The Book of Sales), Chapter 113 after Hadith 436, p.239-240.\"Abu Sa’id Al-Khudri said that while he was with the Prophet of Allah, he asked him, ‘O Messenger of Allah!

It is better for you not to do it. No soul that Allah has decreed to exist will fail to exist.’\"–Bukhari, Volume 3, Book 34 (The Book of Sales), Chapter 111, Hadith 432, p.237.\"Ibn Muhairiz narrated: I entered the mosque and saw Abu Sa’id Al-Khudri and sat beside him. I asked him about Al-‘Azl (i.e., coitus interruptus). Abu Sa’id said, ‘We went with the Messenger of Allah on the campaign of Banu Al-Mustaliq, and we captured some Arab women and we desired them, and celibacy became hard on us. We wanted to engage in coitus interruptus. So we asked the Prophet, and he said, ‘It is better not to do that, because if a soul is destined to exist, it will exist until the Day of Resurrection.’\"–Bukhari, Volume 5, Book 59 (The Book of Military Expeditions), Chapter 31, Hadith 459, p.317. This is also stated in Volume 8, Book 77 (The Book of Qadr), Chapter 3, Hadith 600, p.391.In other words, whatever is destined to happen will happen, so do not interfere unnaturally.

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute | Max Shimba Ministries Org.April 10, 2016AbstractOne of the most common objections raised against the divinity of Jesus Christ—especially by Muslim apologists and groups such as Jehovah's Witnesses—is the question:\"If Jesus was truly God, then to whom was He praying?\"This inquiry, often posed during interfaith discussions, is grounded in a misunderstanding of the dual nature of Christ and the eternal relationship within the Trinity. This scholarly article aims to address this theological question by exploring the scriptural, historical, and doctrinal foundation of Christ’s divine and human nature and His relationship to the Father.IntroductionIn various religious debates, a recurrent question is raised:When Jesus prayed in the Garden of Gethsemane, who was He praying to?The underlying presumption is that if Jesus is God, then it seems paradoxical for Him to pray. More provocatively, critics ask,Since when does God pray or ask for help?These questions merit a robust, biblically grounded response. To understand why Jesus prayed and to whom, one must first comprehend the Christian doctrine of the Trinity and the dual nature of Jesus Christ.The Eternal Relationship Between the Father and the SonBefore the incarnation—before the Word became flesh—Jesus existed eternally as the Son of God in perfect communion with the Father and the Holy Spirit. The Gospel of John affirms this pre-existence and unity:\"The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do... For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.\"(John 5:19–21)\"...that all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father.\"(John 5:23)Moreover,Isaiah 9:6prophetically declares:“For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given... and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.”This passage affirms both the humanity (\"a child is born\") and the divinity (\"a son is given\") of the Messiah. From eternity past, Jesus existed as theSon in the Godhead—coequal and coeternal with the Father and the Holy Spirit.The Doctrine of the TrinityChristian orthodoxy holds that God isone in essenceandthree in person: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. These are not three gods (tritheism), but one God in three distinct persons. Jesus Himself declared,\"I and the Father are one.\"(John 10:30)This statement does not negate personal distinction within the Godhead but affirms ontological unity. Thus, the Son praying to the Father does not signify inferiority but reflects the eternal relationship of love and purpose within the Trinity.The Dual Nature of Jesus Christ (Hypostatic Union)At the incarnation, the eternal Son took upon Himself full humanity while retaining full divinity. This is known as theHypostatic Union—two natures, divine and human, in one person. AsPhilippians 2:5–11explains:\"Christ Jesus... being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: But made himself of no reputation... and was made in the likeness of men...\"Thus, while on earth, Jesus operated fully as man, experiencing human needs, suffering, and dependence, all while remaining truly God. His prayers were a demonstration of His genuine humanity and His relationship with the Father.Jesus' Prayers as a Human BeingIn His earthly life, Jesus prayed frequently—seeking strength, wisdom, and communion with the Father:Mark 1:35– He rose early to pray in solitude.John 11:41–42– He prayed before raising Lazarus, to glorify the Father.John 17– He interceded for His disciples and all future believers in what is often called theHigh Priestly Prayer.These were not the prayers of a lesser deity but the heartfelt cries of the perfect man, perfectly submitted to the will of the Father.As Hebrews 5:8 states:“Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered.”Gethsemane and the Cross: Obedience to the Father's WillThe Garden of Gethsemane (Matthew 26:36–46) vividly portrays Jesus’ agony before the crucifixion. He prayed:“My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.”(v. 39)This was not a denial of divinity but a deep expression of His human anguish. His obedience in prayer revealed His full submission to the Father’s redemptive plan. It wasGod the Son, in human form, fully obedient even unto death, carrying out the will ofGod the Father.Jesus Is Both the One Who Prays and the One to Whom We PrayJesus prayed to the Father while on earth. At the same time, He is worshiped and prayed to, as seen in:Acts 7:59–“Lord Jesus, receive my spirit,”prayed Stephen.John 20:28– Thomas called Jesus,“My Lord and my God!”These texts confirm the early church’s recognition of Jesus’ divinity. He is both the intercessor and the object of faith and worship.Conclusion: No Contradiction in Christ’s PrayersThere is no theological contradiction in Jesus praying to the Father. His prayers reveal:The eternal communion within the Trinity.His full assumption of human nature, including dependence and suffering.The exemplary model of submission and prayer for all believers.Jesus Christ—fully God and fully man—demonstrated in His life of prayer the essential posture of obedience to God. His prayers were not evidence against His divinity but rather proof of the incarnate Word living in total alignment with the divine plan.For Further StudyThe Two Natures of Christ:Max Shimba Article –“Asilia Mbili za Yesu Kristo”Philippians 2:5–11andHebrews 1:1–3for Christ's divine identityJohn 17for the High Priestly Prayer and divine mission of JesusContact for Questions or DialogueEmail:maxshimbaministries@gmail.comPresented by:Dr. Maxwell ShimbaFor:Max Shimba Ministries Org.© 2015–2016, All Rights Reserved",

This assertion, according to Islamic apologetics, implies that Muhammad was prophesied in the Christian Bible. However, a close and contextual reading of the relevant biblical texts, especially in the Gospel of John, clearly demonstrates that the Spirit of Truth refers not to Muhammad or any angelic being, but to the Holy Spirit—God Himself.Muslim Claim: Who is the Spirit of Truth?Many Muslims often ask:Who is the Spirit of Truth that Jesus promised in John 16:12–14?When questioned, they claim that the Spirit of Truth refers either to Muhammad or to the angel Jibril. However, such interpretations fall apart under scriptural scrutiny.John 16:13 (KJV)says:\"Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.\"In the context of John chapters 14–16, Jesus is clearly speaking to His disciples shortly before His crucifixion, referring to the Holy Spirit, whom He will sendafterHis ascension. The Spirit of Truth is identified as divine, active within the lives of the disciples, and present within them—not as a future prophet or angel who comes 600 years later.Scriptural Evidences from the Gospel of JohnBelow are15 scriptural evidencesfrom the Gospel of John proving thatMuhammad is not the Spirit of TruthandJibril is not the Holy Spirit.1.John 1:32\"And John bore record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him [Jesus].\"The Holy Spirit descended upon Jesus at His baptism in visible form. Muhammad neither descended from heaven like a dove nor was present at Jesus' baptism. Moreover, Muhammad came over six centuries later and was never seen by John the Baptist.2.John 1:33\"And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, 'Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.'\"John the Baptist testifies that Jesus is the one who baptizeswiththe Holy Spirit. Muhammad never baptized anyone, and certainly not with the Holy Spirit.3.John 3:5\"Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.\"No one can enter God's Kingdom unless they are born of the Spirit. Muhammad does not impart the Holy Spirit, nor does he bring spiritual rebirth.4.John 3:6\"That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.\"Muhammad was born of the flesh, and never claimed to be born of the Spirit. In contrast, the Holy Spirit is the one who begets spiritual life.5.John 3:8\"The wind bloweth where it listeth... so is every one that is born of the Spirit.\"The Spirit is likened to the wind—unpredictable and sovereign. Muhammad was a man confined to a specific time, place, and culture. He does not fit this spiritual description.6.John 3:34\"For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.\"Jesus received the fullness of the Spirit without measure. Muhammad, however, claimed revelations from Jibril (not the Spirit Himself) and did not claim to have divine omniscience or omnipotence.7.John 4:24\"God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.\"God is Spirit—not Muhammad, not Jibril. The Holy Spirit is a divine person, not a mortal prophet or a created angel.8.John 6:63\"It is the Spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.\"Only the Spirit gives life. Muhammad does not and cannot give eternal life. Jesus' words are Spirit and life, a divine quality absent in Muhammad’s teachings.9.John 7:39\"But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.\"This verse refers to the future indwelling of the Holy Spirit for all believers in Jesus. It does not refer to Muhammad, who was never promised to believers in Christ.10.John 14:16–18“And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you forever;Even the Spirit of truth... ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.”Jesus refers to a Person who will dwell within believers—not someone who would come 600 years later to deliver external messages. Muhammad never dwelled in the hearts of the disciples.11.John 14:26\"But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.\"Jesus identifies the Comforter as theHoly Spirit. Not a man. Not Muhammad. The Holy Spirit comes in Jesus’ name, not his own.12.John 15:26\"But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth... he shall testify of me.\"The Spirit testifies of Christ. Muhammad denied the divine sonship of Jesus and did not bear witness to Him. Therefore, he disqualifies himself as the Spirit of Truth.13.John 16:13\"Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth... and he will shew you things to come.\"The Spirit was to come shortly after Christ’s ascension, guiding the apostles directly—not centuries later to a different audience, in a different language, and denying Christ’s deity.14.John 16:15\"All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you.\"The Spirit reveals the things of Christ. Muhammad never claimed to be indwelt by Christ, nor did he teach from Christ’s authority or glorify Him.15.John 20:21–22\"Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you.And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost.\"Jesus gave the Holy Spirit to His disciples directly—not through Muhammad, who was not born until centuries later. This marks the clear fulfillment of Jesus' promise.Conclusion: The Spirit of Truth is Not Muhammad or JibrilThrough careful exegesis of the Gospel of John, we conclude decisively and biblically:Muhammad is notthe Spirit of Truth.Jibril is notthe Holy Spirit.TheHoly Spirit is God—the Third Person of the Trinity, promised by Jesus, given to His disciples at Pentecost, and continuing to dwell in believers today.Jesus did not leave His disciples to wait 600 years for a mortal man to deliver final truth. He gave them the Holy Spirit—immediately,eternally, andpersonally.In His Service,Dr. Maxwell ShimbaFounder, Max Shimba MinistriesShimba Theological Institute© Max Shimba Ministries 2016.

That is why He did not create everyone at once. He started with one man, and from that man, we all came. Likewise, He began by revealing Himself to only one nation on earth. From there, salvation would spread to all nations. It is an evident truth that, apart from Israel, all other societies in the world were originally idol worshippers (i.e., worshippers of demons). Only Israel began with the true God.That is why the Lord Jesus, when speaking with the Samaritan woman at the well, told her:“You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews.” (John 4:22).Salvation is from the Jews because no other nation on earth knew the true God—all had pagan religions—whether Europeans, Africans, Indians, Arabs, etc. That is the truth.To say that Jesus did not come for all nations is no different than saying, “Since God only created Adam and Eve, He is not the God of my family because He did not create me the same way He created Adam.”Jesus once spoke to His disciples and said:“This is what is written: The Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day, and repentance for the forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.” (Luke 24:46-47).Do you see that the Gospel was to begin in Jerusalem? And do you also see that He says all nations will be preached to in His name? Are all nations limited to Israel only?The Canaanite woman came at the wrong time. That was the time for preaching the Gospel to Israel first before it could go to the rest of the world.Below is further evidence from the words of the Lord Jesus Himself confirming that He was sent to all nations of the world and that He is the Messiah of God—meaning, the one anointed with the Holy Spirit to redeem the whole world:“But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.” (Acts 1:8).“Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.” (Matthew 28:19).“For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.” (John 3:17).“If anyone hears my words and does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world, but to save the world.” (John 12:47).“I lay down my life for the sheep. I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen. I must bring them also. They too will listen to my voice, and there shall be one flock and one shepherd.” (John 10:15-16).“And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.” (Matthew 24:14).Let me conclude by revisiting some points I have mentioned. God has always had a pattern of beginning with one person.He created one human being, and we all came from him.He revealed Himself to one nation, and we all came to know Him through that.He started with one Son (Jesus), and we are all born again through faith in Him.In the same way, He brought salvation first to one nation—Israel—then it spread outward. That’s why He said to the Samaritan woman at the well: “Salvation is from the Jews.” (John 4:22).This pattern of beginning with one person or place is evidence that those who comfort themselves by saying “all religions are just different paths that all lead to God” are deceiving themselves and wasting both their time and their eternal lives! “Salvation is from the Jews”—meaning FROM JESUS ALONE!Now, because the time for the spread of that salvation had not yet come (since God operates according to seasons and appointed times), He told that Canaanite woman (a non-Jew) that He was sent only to Israel.But when the fullness of time had come—after His death and resurrection—we see Him now sending His apostles to the entire world.And the Bible clearly states:“Therefore, remember that formerly you who are Gentiles by birth and called ‘uncircumcised’ by those who call themselves ‘the circumcision’ (which is done in the body by human hands)—remember that at that time you were separate from Christ, excluded from citizenship in Israel and foreigners to the covenants of the promise, without hope and without God in the world. But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near by the blood of Christ.For he himself is our peace, who has made the two groups one and has destroyed the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility,by setting aside in his flesh the law with its commands and regulations. His purpose was to create in himself one new humanity out of the two, thus making peace,and in one body to reconcile both of them to God through the cross, by which he put to death their hostility.” (Ephesians 2:11–16).MeditateQuestion thingsAsk yourselfTake actionGod bless you greatly.It is I,Dr. Maxwell Shimba, servant of Jesus Christ,For Max Shimba Ministries OrgMAX SHIMBA MINISTRIES ORG ©2016.

They often accuse critics of slander and falsehood, while failing to offer concrete scriptural evidence to defend their positions. Today, I pose a critical and theological inquiry directed to Muslims:Where in the Qur'an does Allah command the establishment of religious titles such as Imams, Sheikhs, or Ustaadhs?Theological Challenge to IslamMuslims are invited to present direct verses from the Qur'an that clearly authorize the creation or appointment of religious leaders with the titles ofImam,Sheikh, orUstaadh, along with their qualifications and roles. This call for evidence is not out of hostility but arises from a sincere desire for truth and clarity. If these roles are divinely ordained, as claimed, then surely there must be explicit Qur'anic support for them.To date, no verse has been cited that outlines these positions with clarity and divine authority. Instead, what is often presented isSurah Al-Baqarah 2:124, which reads:“And (remember) when Abraham was tried by his Lord with certain commands, which he fulfilled. He (Allah) said: ‘Indeed I will make you a leader (Imam) for the people.’ Abraham said: ‘And of my descendants?’ [Allah] said: ‘My covenant does not include the wrongdoers.’”This verse, however, refers specifically to Abraham’s divine testing and appointment, not to a systematic, replicable framework for religious leadership within Islam. It does not establish the office of “Imam” as a clerical title or provide qualifications for such an office in Islamic practice.Absence of Clerical Structure in the Qur'anThere is a notable absence of guidance in the Qur'an concerning thecriteria, responsibilities, or divine mandatefor individuals to bear titles likeImam,Sheikh, orUstaadh. If these positions are fundamental to Islamic religious life, as widely practiced, one would expect the Qur'an to offer detailed prescriptions concerning their qualifications, moral character, and appointment procedures.This lack of guidance raises theological and doctrinal concerns about theauthenticityanddivine originof such clerical titles within Islam. Their presence in Islamic societies appears more cultural or traditional rather than scripturally mandated.Contrast with Christian Leadership in the BibleIn contrast, the Bible offerscomprehensive and divinely inspired instructionsregarding church leadership. Scripture clearly identifies offices within the Church and outlines their qualifications:Christ is the head of the Church– the ultimate authority (Ephesians 1:22; 4:15; Colossians 1:18).Church autonomyis affirmed – local churches are self-governing under Christ’s headship (Titus 1:5).Spiritual leadershipis established through two primary offices –elders (bishops/pastors)anddeacons.Biblical Qualifications for Church LeadersBishops/Pastors:1 Timothy 3:1-7provides a detailed list of qualifications, including moral integrity, faithful family life, self-control, hospitality, teaching ability, and spiritual maturity.Deacons:1 Timothy 3:8-13outlines the requirements for deacons, including dignity, honesty, spiritual conviction, and a disciplined life. Their wives must also exhibit honorable character (verse 11).These offices are not cultural inventions butclearly instituted by divine instruction. Other supporting texts includeTitus 1:1–4,Titus 1:5–3:11, andTitus 2:11–15, which further affirm the structure and function of Christian leadership.ConclusionThe glaring lack of explicit Qur'anic guidance on the roles ofImam,Sheikh, orUstaadhsuggests that these areman-made constructs, not divine appointments. They lack scriptural authority and transparency in their origin and function. By contrast,the Bible provides robust, inspired criteria for religious leadership, grounded in divine order and spiritual integrity.I extend an open invitation to all Muslims to examine these truths and consider embracing the Christian faith, where God has clearly revealed His will concerning church leadership and governance. Christianity, unlike Islam, offers a spiritual structure ordained by God, grounded in Scripture, and manifest in the lives of Spirit-filled leaders.May the Lord bless you with wisdom and understanding.Dr. Maxwell ShimbaFounder, Max Shimba Ministries Org.",

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba | Shimba Theological Institute | Max Shimba Ministries Org ©2016IntroductionDear reader,Today, I would like us to reflect on a serious theological issue: the apparent hatred found within Islam, particularly in the Qur’an, directed at Christians and Jews. Many people mistakenly assume that the God of the Bible, full of love, is the same as Allah of the Qur’an. This, however, is a grave misconception.The God revealed in the Bible is characterized by love and grace, while the Allah of the Qur’an, as we shall demonstrate, promotes hostility, hatred, and division. The Qur’an, which is the central text of Islam, shows that Allah commands his followers to harbor animosity toward Christians and Jews.1. Allah Forbids Friendship with Christians and JewsQur’an, Surah Al-Ma’idah 5:51\"O you who have believed, do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies. They are [in fact] allies of one another. And whoever is an ally to them among you – then indeed, he is [one] of them. Indeed, Allah guides not the wrongdoing people.\"If Allah is the same as Yahweh, the loving God of the Bible, why then does he forbid friendship with people of other faiths?Compare this to the commandment of Jesus Christ:Luke 6:35 (Holy Bible – SNT)\"But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High, because He is kind to the ungrateful and wicked.\"Clearly, the teachings of Jesus and the commands of Allah are diametrically opposed. The God of the Bible teaches us to love even our enemies. Allah promotes hatred.2. Allah Forbids Muslims from Loving Christians – Even Close FamilySurah Al-Mujādilah 58:22\"You will not find a people who believe in Allah and the Last Day having affection for those who oppose Allah and His Messenger, even if they were their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their kindred...\"This verse teaches that Muslims must not love those who do not follow Islam, even if they are family members. Such a position is starkly different from the teachings of the Bible, which emphasizes compassion, mercy, and familial responsibility.3. Allah Orders Muslims Not to Associate with Jews and ChristiansSurah An-Nisa 4:144\"O you who have believed, do not take the disbelievers as allies instead of the believers. Do you wish to offer Allah a clear case against yourselves?\"This kind of command encourages religious segregation and conflict. By contrast, the Bible repeatedly encourages unity, peace, and love for all people.4. Allah Warns Against Trusting Non-MuslimsSurah Al-Imran 3:118\"O you who have believed, do not take those outside your religion as confidants. They will not fail to ruin you; they wish you would have hardship. Hatred has already appeared from their mouths, and what their hearts conceal is greater...\"Again, this verse reflects a deep mistrust and animosity toward non-Muslims, which contradicts the character of God in the Bible who instructs us to walk in love and truth.5. Allah Declares Disbelievers as Open EnemiesSurah An-Nisa 4:101\"And when you travel throughout the land, there is no blame upon you for shortening the prayer [especially] if you fear that those who disbelieve may harm you. Indeed, the disbelievers are ever to you a clear enemy.\"This verse classifies all non-Muslims as enemies, further fueling religious division. Yet the God of the Bible declares:John 10:10-11\"The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I came that they may have life and have it abundantly. I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.\"The Lord Jesus brings life, not death. He heals, unites, and restores. The contrast is undeniable.6. Allah Commands Muslims to Fight and Kill DisbelieversSurah At-Tawbah 9:123\"O you who have believed, fight those adjacent to you of the disbelievers and let them find in you harshness. And know that Allah is with the righteous.\"Violence is normalized and even glorified under this command. Conversely, Jesus taught that\"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God\"(Matthew 5:9).7. Allah Declares Christians and Jews as Enemies Until They ConvertSurah Al-Mumtahanah 60:4\"...We disbelieve in you, and there has appeared between us and you animosity and hatred forever until you believe in Allah alone...\"This eternal hatred is entirely contrary to the heart of God revealed in Christ, who loves unconditionally and calls all people to repentance through grace.Jesus the Giver of Abundant LifeJesus, the Son of God, said:John 10:10\"The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I came that they may have life and have it abundantly.\"Satan's agenda has always been destruction. But Jesus came to bring life in its fullness—restoring, healing, and blessing every area of life: family, business, health, and relationships.If the enemy has stolen or destroyed anything in your life, remember:Jesus came so you may have life—life in abundance.Final ExhortationDear beloved,Do not allow hatred to rule your heart. Choose the path of love, peace, and salvation through Jesus Christ. The character of Allah, as seen in the Qur’an, bears no resemblance to the loving God revealed in the Holy Bible. Allah’s attributes reflect those of Satan—the deceiver, the divider, the destroyer. But Jesus Christ is the Good Shepherd, the Savior, and the Author of Life.If you feel convicted and want to surrender your life to Jesus, reach out to us. We will help you take the most important step in your life.Jesus loves you.In His service,Dr. Maxwell ShimbaServant of the Lord Jesus ChristShimba Theological Institute | Max Shimba Ministries OrgAll rights reserved.

Muhammad Says the Sun Wears a Garment, Which Causes Night DarknessDear reader,I have often said that Allah is not the Creator, but Muslims have been stubborn to accept this and instead begin insulting me. Today, I bring you another piece of evidence that Allah did not create, and Muhammad is a false prophet.What Did Muhammad and the Early Muslims Say About the Sun?Where would you go to find the correct meaning of the Quran? Zamakhshari? al-Tabari? Baidawi? If you were an early Muslim, you could go to Muhammad himself! Listen to how Muhammad explained it, according to Bukhari and al-Tabari:“Abu Dharr reported: The Prophet asked me at sunset, ‘Do you know where the sun goes (at sunset)?’ I replied, ‘Allah and His Messenger know best.’ He said, ‘It goes (i.e., it travels) until it prostrates itself beneath the Throne and seeks permission to rise again. It is then permitted. But a time will come when it will be about to prostrate, and its prostration will not be accepted...’”(Sahih Bukhari, Vol. 4, Book 54, Chapter 4, Hadith No. 441, p.283)Muhammad Says the Sun Prostrates Under Allah's ThroneAnother version of the same Bukhari hadith says:“Abu Dharr al-Ghifari (RA) narrated: One day, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) asked me, ‘Abu Dharr, do you know where the sun goes after it sets?’ I replied, ‘I do not know. Only the Messenger of Allah can explain it best.’ Then the Prophet (SA) answered, ‘After setting, the sun stays in prostration under the Throne (‘Arsh) and waits for Allah’s command to rise again from the east. A day will come when the sun will not be granted permission to rise, and Qiyamah (Judgment Day) will commence upon the earth.’”Muhammad Contradicts and Says the Sun Sets in the SkyMuhammad Says the Sun Wears a Garment/ClothingAccording toal-Tabari Volume 1, p.231, “I asked the Messenger of God [Muhammad], ‘Where does [the sun] set?’ He replied: ‘It sets in the heaven and then ascends from one heaven to another until it reaches the seventh heaven. Eventually, when it is beneath the Throne, it falls down in prostration, and the angels that oversee it also prostrate. Then the sun says, ‘My Lord, where do You command me to rise— from the place where I set or the place I rose from?’”He continued: This is what is meant by God's word:‘And the sun runs on its fixed course for a term (appointed). That is the Decree of the Almighty, the All-Knowing.’(Quran) – that is when the sun is held under the Throne.Then Gabriel brings the sun a garment of radiance taken from the light of the Throne, in proportion to hours and days. The garment is longer during summer and shorter in winter, and average in spring and autumn. [The seasons are said to be due to the garment’s length.]He continued: The sun wears this garment as one of you wears your robe. Then it is released to orbit the heavenly sphere until it rises from where it is commanded. … The same path is followed by the moon when it rises. But Gabriel brings a different garment from the light beneath God's feet. Thus, the meaning of God’s word:‘He made the sun a shining glory and the moon a derived light.’”The Sun and Moon as Signs of AllahSee also:Abu Dawud Vol. 1, Book 2, Hadith 1173, p.304Sunan al-Nasa’i Vol. 2, Hadith 1462–1506 (multiple pages listed)Dhu al-Qarnayn [Zul Qarnain] Witnesses the Sun Setting in a Muddy SpringAccording toal-Tabari Vol. 5, p.173-174(cf. Surah 18:82–97),Dhu al-Qarnayn “witnessed the sun setting in its resting place in a pool of black and foul-smelling mud.”al-Tabari Vol. 1, p.234also states that the sun sets in a muddy spring.The term \"muddy\" is translated from the Arabichami’ah, meaning dark clay or mud. However, a similar wordhamiyahcan also mean a scorching substance. (See footnote 442 on p.234.)“[Muhammad] continued. When the sun rises, it ascends on a chariot (pulled by horses) from one of those springs along with 360 angels…. When God wants to test the sun and moon to show His servants signs and thereby call them to obedience, the sun suddenly falls off its chariot into the depth of the sea, which is circular in shape.When God wants to intensify the warning sign to further frighten His servants, the entire sun falls in, leaving no part remaining on the chariot. This is a total eclipse of the sun, during which daylight is overtaken by darkness and stars appear.”(al-Tabari Vol. 1, p.236)Bibliography: Quran TranslationsArberry, Arthur J.The Koran Interpreted.

But is that really true?Islam began with Muhammad in the 600s AD. What were the beliefs of the Arabs before him? Are there any elements from those beliefs that made their way into Islam? In other words, is Islam free of paganism?Join me in this detailed analysis exploring the origins of Islam so we can discover whether there is any connection between Islam and the paganism that prevailed among Arab communities before the rise of Muhammad.The Origin of AllahHuman societies across the world have long pondered where the universe came from, the meaning of life, and what happens after death. As a result, every society developed a belief in a higher power (or powers) who were to be worshipped and invoked in times of trouble. These deities were known by different names in different communities, and each society developed a special means of communicating with these powers—that is, with their gods.One undeniable truth is this:except for the Jewish people, every other society in the world—whether African, European, Asian, etc.—began with pagan worship. These societies worshipped various gods, often represented by natural objects like mountains, trees, the sun, the moon, giant serpents, statues, and kings. For instance, the Romans had gods like Artemis, Jupiter, Minerva, Atlas. The Greeks had gods like Chronos, Dionysus, Eros, Ares, Apollo, Hermes, Poseidon. Indians had gods like Durga, Ganesha, Garusha, and Brahma.These pagan religions became widespread. Buddhism, for example, is a pagan religion that spread across much of Asia—India, Japan, Sri Lanka, China, etc.Thus, Arab societies, like other human communities, were no different—they too had their pagan worship systems. They worshipped what is known today as the“Star Family”—so called because they anthropomorphized their gods. Themoon was considered a male god, thesun his wife, and together they hadthree daughters:Al-Lat, Al-Uzza, and Manat.That’s why the Qur’an even says:\"Have you considered Al-Lat and Al-‘Uzza, and another, the third (goddess), Manat?\"(Surah 53:19–20)Even Muhammad used to worship these gods before founding Islam. According to Hisham al-Kalbi inKitab al-Asnam (Book of Idols), page 17:“We have been told that the Apostle of Allah once mentioned Al-Uzza saying, ‘I have offered a white sheep to Al-‘Uzza, while I was a follower of the religion of my people.’”His people were the Quraysh.The nameAllahcomes fromal-ilah. “Al” is like the English article “the”; and “ilah” means god. Soal-ilahmeans “the god.” Over time, through linguistic evolution, this was shortened toAllah, just like in Swahili one might say \"ndo ivo\" (meaning “that’s how it is”) instead of “ndiyo hivyo.”So, who wasAllah? He was themoon god, whose wife was the sun and whose daughters were Al-Lat, Al-Uzza, and Manat. These were the chief deities among the many gods worshipped by pre-Islamic Arabs during theJahiliyyah(Age of Ignorance).The nameAllahis masculine—hence the daughter is calledAl-Lat, a feminine version, just as in names likeFrancis(male) andFrancisca(female). The same applies toAllahandAl-Lat—same root, different gender.One tribe that notably worshipped Allah was theQuraysh, the tribe from which Muhammad came. Some people mistakenly believe that the nameAllahonly became known after Muhammad. Others argue that Allah was known since the time of Abraham in the same way He is known today. But if that were true, then how did the Allah of Abraham disappear and get replaced by a pagan moon god?Notably, Muhammad’s father was a pagan, not a Muslim. Some Muslims claim otherwise, but Muhammad himself said the following:Anas reported: A man asked the Messenger of Allah, \"Where is my father?\" He replied, \"In the Fire.\" When the man turned away, the Prophet called him back and said, \"Indeed, my father and your father are in the Fire.\"(Sahih Muslim, Book 001, Number 0398)If Muhammad’s father was a pagan,why was he named \"Abdullah\", meaning“servant of Allah”? That clearly indicates that even pagans in the Jahiliyyah era worshippedAllah, to the extent of naming their children after him—just as Jews named their children in honor of Yahweh:Joshua – Yahweh is salvationJotham – Yahweh is perfectJehoahaz – Yahweh has heldHezekiah – Yahweh strengthensElisha – God is salvationThe answer is clear:Allah was a pagan moon god, also known asHubal, who was worshipped not only by Arabs but across the Middle East. Archaeological evidence abounds showing the worship of the moon, sun, and stars was common throughout that region.Muhammad’s grandfather,Abdul Muttalib, almost sacrificed Muhammad’s fatherAbdullahas an offering toAllah. Instead, he was redeemed by sacrificing 100 camels—at the Kaaba!“An arrow showed that it was ‘Abdullah to be sacrificed. ‘Abdul-Muttalib then took the boy to Al-Ka'bah with a razor to slaughter the boy. Quraysh, his uncles from the Makhzum tribe, and his brother Abu Talib tried to dissuade him. They suggested he summon a female diviner, who ordered divination arrows to be drawn between Abdullah and 10 camels... the number of camels eventually reached one hundred.”(Ibn Hisham 1/151–155; Rahmat-ul-lil’alameen 2/89–90)That’s whyGod in the Bible consistently warned the Israelites not to worship the star family or heavenly hostslike the sun, moon, or stars:Deuteronomy 4:19“And beware not to lift up your eyes to heaven and see the sun and the moon and the stars—all the host of heaven—and be drawn away and worship them…”Deuteronomy 17:2–3“…and has gone and served other gods and worshiped them, or the sun or the moon or any of the heavenly host…”2 Kings 21:3, 5; 23:5Jeremiah 8:2; 19:13Zephaniah 1:5The Year Muhammad Was Born (570 AD)In the same year Muhammad was born,Abrahah al-Ashram, a ruler from Aksum (Ethiopia) stationed in Yemen, sought to destroy the Kaaba. He built a cathedral in Sana’a hoping to rival Mecca’s pagan pilgrimage but failed.So, he marched toward Mecca with a large army and elephants—hence,“The Year of the Elephant.”Quraysh tribes united to defend the Kaaba. Muhammad’s grandfatherAbdul Muttalibsaid:“The Owner of this House is its Defender, and I am sure He will save it from the attack of the adversaries and will not dishonor the servants of His House.”Islamic tradition says birds dropped stones on Abrahah’s army, defeating them. The Qur’an records this inSurah Al-Fil 105:1–5:“Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with the people of the elephant? Did He not make their plot go astray? And He sent against them birds in flocks, striking them with stones of baked clay, and made them like chewed straw.”But this happenedbefore Islam, during apagan era, when the Kaaba was full of pagan idols. Abdul Muttalib didn’t know the Allah of Muhammad.So who was the “Lord” who defended the Kaaba according to Qur’an 105? It could only have been the samepagan god Allahworshipped at that time—not the God of the Bible.ConclusionIf you are a Muslim, ask yourself:Why is themoonso central to your religious calendar?Why must the moon be sighted beforefasting beginsorends?Why is thecrescent moon and starthe main symbol atop every mosque?What is the origin of these symbols?http://maxshimba.blogspot.com/…/urithi-wa-uislamu-kutoka-kw…God bless you all.By permissionI am Dr. Maxwell Shimba, a servant of Jesus Christ,For Max Shimba Ministries Org,©2016.

He responded by saying that it is permissible to hunt hyenas. He asked if it was permissible to eat them, and he responded that eating hyena is halal (permissible).He asked again, \"Did the Prophet of Allah (SAW) permit eating hyenas?\" Jabir replied, \"YES, the Prophet of Allah permitted eating hyenas.\" [Abu Dawud 3801, T 1798, Ibn e Majah 3085, Ahmedl4456]9- Kitabu cha HAJJAs we read above, Muslims are allowed to eat hyena meat. Moreover, Muhammad permitted eating lizard meat.PROPHET MUHAMMAD SAID EATING LIZARD MEAT IS HALALSahih Muslim Book 21, Number 4788:Ibn 'Umar reported that some people were with the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) among his companions, including Sa'd. Then a lizard was brought and placed before the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). A woman among the wives of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, \"It is lizard meat.\" Thereupon the Prophet Muhammad said, \"Eat it, for it is lawful (halal).”Muslims claim eating pork is haram, but they eat hyenas and lizards. They say eating pork is haram, but they consume camels. This is quite contradictory.A question to ponder: If Jehovah, the God of Moses, is the same as Allah of the Muslims, why do Muslims contradict the verse about eating camels?Leviticus 7:4:\"Moreover, these you shall not eat among those that chew the cud or those that have cloven hooves: the camel, because it chews the cud but does not have cloven hooves, is unclean to you.\"Furthermore, Muslims drink camel urine and milk. Is this not breaking the commandment stated in Leviticus 7:4?Abdallah Ibn Umar said that eating camel meat and drinking its milk is HARAM. Yet Muslims continue to eat camel meat and drink its milk and urine. (‘Abdallah Ibn ‘Umar al-Baydawi, Tafsir al-baydawi)MUHAMMAD ALLOWED MUSLIMS TO DRINK CAMEL URINE AND MILK, WHICH IS HARAM IN [LEVITICUS 7:4]Nevertheless, Muhammad instructed some people to follow his shepherd and drink the camel's milk and urine.Bukhari Volume 7, Book 71, Hadith 589, 590, and Volume 7, Book 71, Hadith 623.Muhammad also said that camel urine is a good remedy.Ibn-i-Majah Volume 5, Book 31, Hadith 3503.Some Muslims were told to drink camel urine, but they ended up rebelling and killing the shepherd. Muhammad ordered their hands and feet to be cut off and their eyes to be branded.Sunan Nasa’i Volume 1, Hadith 308-309. See also Bukhari Volume 4, Book 52, Hadith 261.Now, if camels are haram inLeviticus 7:4, why did Muhammad permit Muslims to eat its meat and drink its urine and milk?Why do Muhammad and Allah allow the consumption and drinking of camel meat and urine, which is prohibited in Leviticus?This is a significant contradiction for Muslims and the Prophet Muhammad for breaking God's commandment not to eat the meat of camels, lizards, hyenas, and hares.Welcome to Jesus, the living and great God,God bless you all,In His Service,Max Shimba Ministries Org.MAX SHIMBA MINISTRIES ORG ©2016.

I hear many narrations (Hadiths) from you but I forget them.' Allah's Messenger said, 'Spread your garment.' I did accordingly and then he moved his hands as if scooping something and emptied it into my garment and said, 'Take and wrap this sheet over your body.' I did it and after that I never forgot anything.\" (Bukhari Volume 1, Book 3, Hadith 119). Also found in Bukhari Volume 4, Book 56, Hadith 841; Bukhari Volume 9, Book 23, Hadith 452.\"Abu Huraira narrated: The Prophet said, 'If a fly falls in the vessel of any of you, let him dip all of it (into the vessel) and then throw it away, for in one of its wings there is a disease and in the other there is healing (antidote for the disease).'\" (Bukhari Volume 7, Book 71, Hadith 673).The footnotes explain that modern medicine has found that flies carry pathogens on some parts of their bodies, but they also carry antidotes for these pathogens. This explanation suggests that dipping the fly releases the antidote to counteract the disease.Muhammad Says Drinking Camel Urine Is MedicineUsing Camel Urine as a Cure:According to Muhammad, people are punished in their graves for defiling themselves with urine. (Bukhari Volume 1, Book 4, Hadith 215; Bukhari Volume 1, Book 4, Hadith 217).However, Muhammad instructed some people to follow his shepherd and drink the camel's milk and urine as a remedy. (Bukhari Volume 7, Book 71, Hadith 589, 590 and Volume 7, Book 71, Hadith 623).Muhammad also said that camel urine is a good remedy. (Ibn-i-Majah Volume 5, Book 31, Hadith 3503).Some Muslims were told to drink camel urine and ended up rebelling and killing the shepherd. Muhammad ordered their hands and feet to be cut off and their eyes to be branded. (Sunan Nasa’i Volume 1, Hadith 308-309). See also Bukhari Volume 4, Book 52, Hadith 261.Religious Incantations as a Remedy for Scorpion Stings:Muhammad used incantations to remove the poison from scorpion stings. (Sahih Muslim Volume 3, Book 24, Hadith 5442-5444, 5448).Muhammad and Other Remedies:There is no disease that does not have a cure according to Sahih Muslim Volume 3, Page 1199, 1200.Allah has made a remedy for every disease except old age. (Abu Dawud Volume 3, Hadith 3846).An entire book in Ibn-i-Majah (Volume 5) is dedicated to medicine. It states that every disease except old age has a remedy. (Ibn-i-Majah Volume 5, Hadith 3436, Page 1).Muhammad advised people with pain in their legs to apply henna. (Abu Dawud Volume 3, Hadith 3849).Collyrium (an eye wash) makes the eyes bright and promotes the growth of eyelashes. (Ibn-i-Majah Volume 5, Book 31, Hadith 3497, Page 35).Disclaimer:The footnotes quote a doctor from the Department of Hadith; they did not get a quote from the Department of Medicine or Health.One wing of a fly has a disease and the other has the cure. (Abu Dawud Volume 3, Hadith 3835).If a fly falls into the drink, dip the other wing into the drink. (Ibn-i-Majah Volume 5, Hadith 3504-3505).Muhammad and Clean Water:Regarding health control by removing impure water and waste: When asked about drinking water from a well containing menstrual rags, dead dogs, and stinking things, Muhammad said that water is always pure and is not defiled by anything. (Abu Dawud Volume 1, Chapter 35, Hadith 66-67).Conclusion:These teachings highlight the significant differences in understanding and approach to health and medicine between Islamic traditions and modern science.Today, we have learned something about Islam, which relies more on worldly matters rather than trusting in the living God.Sincerely,Dr. Max Shimba, a servant of Jesus Christ, the Great God.

First, we will examine the plain meaning of Surah 18:85–86, and then we will examine the explanations and responses of some Muslims regarding this matter.A Little AstronomyIt may not be widely known that the Islamic Abbasid rulers, Arabs, and Persians advanced greatly in astronomy, giving many stars their names, and even transcribed and corrected some of the astronomical charts of the Egyptian ruler Ptolemy (Ptolemy’s tables). However, the sun is many times larger than the entire earth, and the earth travels around the sun. The sun does not set in a muddy spring.Who is Zul-Qarnain?We have no evidence that Muhammad told anyone exactly who Zul-Qarnain was. Muslims have four different views:Alexander the Great (of Macedonia)– This is the most common Muslim view. Zul-Qarnain means “the one with two horns.” There is a fabricated myth saying that Alexander the Great was a god and had two ram’s horns growing from the sides of his head. Despite the fact that this was not true (and it would be difficult to find a battle helmet large enough), this story was known, and many Muslims assume that Allah in Surah 18 was referring to Alexander by this divine name.Cyrus I of Persia– Another view. His kingdom indeed consisted of two groups: the Medes and the Persians, but beyond that there is no evidence that the two horns refer to him.A Yemeni king who wore a battle helmet with two ram’s horns– A view held by some Muslims.An unknown man– The fourth view. However, it does not seem wise to provide explanations about people the speaker had never heard of.Conclusion:It does not matter who Zul-Qarnain actually was. If he discovered that the sun sets in a muddy spring, and the sun does not set in a muddy spring, then this is false — regardless of the person Muhammad was referring to.Surah 18 Ideas and ResponsesIdea 1: The sun actually sets in a muddy spring!For early Muslims, the Qur’an taught that this literally happens. The early Muslim historianal-Tabari, vol. 1 p.234, shows this. A second example:“[Dhu al-Qarnaiyn] witnessed the setting of the sun in its resting place in a black, foul-smelling muddy spring.” (al-Tabari vol. 5 pp.173–174).Dhu Qarnain is also found in al-Tabari vol. 1 p.371.Another point connected to this: the earth rests on a large fish according to al-Tabari vol. 1 p.220 (839–923 A.D.).Idea 2: The sun appeared to Alexander as setting in Lake Ithaca in MacedoniaThis idea assumes Zul-Qarnain was Alexander and that Alexander was a good Muslim. This contradicts the fact that Alexander had a temple built for him. Also, Alexander went to conquer north and west of Ithaca — modern-day Albania.Worse, the Greeks had settlements hundreds of miles west of Ithaca (Spain, Sicily, etc.) at least five hundred years before Alexander. What would make a very intelligent Greek think that the sun sets in a Macedonian lake when Greek ships traveled much farther west beyond Alexander’s country? Furthermore,Tertullian, inA Treatise on the Soulchapter 49 p.227, says that Aristotle, who lived around the same time, mentions a hero from the island of Sardinia far west of Macedonia but around the same latitude.Idea 3: The “muddy spring” is the Atlantic OceanThe Atlantic Ocean has no mud and is not black — it is blue-green. Also, it is not a spring but an ocean. The sun does not set in the ocean. More importantly, Alexander, Cyrus I of Persia, and Yemeni kings never traveled to the Atlantic Ocean, yet Surah 18:85–86 says Zul-Qarnain saw or witnessed this.Any one of these points is enough to refute this idea, so why do Muslims suggest it? This shows how far they try to go to prove that Surah 18:1–2 is not in error. If Allah of Islam had this idea in the Qur’an, and Allah knew it was false, then this would be a lie. If the Allah of Islam did not know this fact, then he would lack knowledge and could not be all-knowing. If these verses did not come from the Allah of Islam, then the Qur’an would contain obvious errors, because it attributes this falsehood to Allah when it is not true. Of course, if the Islamic Allah is not real, and the true God is not the author of the Qur’an, then the Islamic Allah did not lie because he does not exist.Idea 4: The “muddy spring” is where Cyrus I viewed the Black SeaEven if Cyrus I traveled west of the eastern shore of the Black Sea, how would the sun appear to set in the Black Sea if he had already passed the eastern shore going south and east? We have no evidence that Cyrus ever traveled to the region including present-day Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, etc., which lie east of the Black Sea.A Muslim would have a slightly less weak argument if they said Cyrus saw the sun rise from the Black Sea, because he traveled to Greece. But the Qur’an speaks of sunset. Yet the Black Sea is not a spring, and everyone from the Egyptians to far-northern peoples knew the sun did not set in the Black Sea.Idea 5: The “muddy spring” is where Cyrus I viewed the Aegean SeaBut the Persians knew the Athenians, Spartans (Greek origins), and other Greeks well. The Persians knew the Greeks were not on the other side of the sun.Idea 6: The “muddy spring” is where the king viewed the Red SeaThe Yemenis (Sabaeans/Shebans) always knew the Abyssinians (Ethiopians) lived across the water. If they believed the sun set in the Red Sea, then Abyssinians would be the people on the other side of where the sun went.Idea 7: The “muddy spring” is a metaphor for something elseIf this was not literal but a metaphor for other things, then the Qur’an failed to explain that it was not real, and the idea was misleading. Above all, no one can say for sure what exactly it would symbolize.There is nothing in the Qur’an showing this is not literal, and most early Muslims took it as literal fact. Since they understood the exact meaning from Muhammad’s followers, they were misled by Surah 18.Idea 8: Muhammad was narrating a dreamThis view does not know who Zul-Qarnain actually was. If Muhammad was narrating a dream, the sun could set anywhere he wanted it to. But even if one does not know which imaginary person is seeing a false thing, how can such a person teach us to believe the truth?However, if someone said that he saw a certain man named ‘Ali doing miraculous things, and millions of people believed him for centuries — could he be called a liar if he forgot to tell them, “It was only my dream; I never actually saw Ali do that with my eyes”?ConclusionRegardless of whether Zul-Qarnain was Alexander the Great or someone else, the Qur’an states this as fact: that the sun sets in a muddy spring. Even people a thousand years before Muhammad knew the sun did not set at the western edge of Spain. This idea was not metaphorical because no early Muslim is known to have taken it as non-literal or interpreted it as a metaphor for something else, and all early Muslims believed the Qur’an was not written to deceive.List of Qur’an Translation BooksArberry, Arthur J.The Koran Interpreted.

The early Muslim historian al-Tabari, volume 1, page 234, shows this. Another example is “[Dhu al-Qarnaiyn] saw the setting of the sun in its resting place in a black, muddy spring.” According to al-Tabari volume 5, pages 173-174, Dhu Qarnain [Zul Qarnain] is also found in al-Tabari volume 1, page 371.Another related thing is that the Earth sits on a large fish according to al-Tabari volume 1, page 220 (839-923 CE).Idea 2: The sun appeared to Alexander to set in the lake of Ithaca in MacedoniaThis idea assumes that Zul-Qarnain was Alexander, and that Alexander was a good Muslim. This idea does not fit with the fact that Alexander had a temple built for himself. Additionally, Alexander went to conquer lands northwest of Ithaca, which is modern Albania.Even worse for this idea, Greeks had settlements hundreds of miles west of Ithaca, including in Spain, Sicily, etc., for at least five hundred years before Alexander. Why would a very intelligent Greek think the sun set in a lake in Macedonia when Greek ships were sailing far west of Alexander’s country? Furthermore, Tertullian in \"A Treatise on the Soul\" chapter 49, page 227, says that Aristotle, who lived at the same time, mentions a hero from the island of Sardinia far west of Macedonia but about the same latitude.Idea 3: The “spring of muddy water” is the Atlantic OceanThe Atlantic Ocean is not muddy and not black; it is blue-green. Also, it is not a spring but an ocean. The sun does not set in the ocean. More importantly, Alexander, Cyrus I of Persia, and the kings of Yemen never went to the Atlantic Ocean, and Surah 18:85-86 says Zul Qarnain saw or witnessed this.Any one of these four reasons is enough to dismiss this idea, so why do some Muslims propose this? This shows the lengths they go to in order to show that Surah 18:1-2 is not false. If the Allah of Islam thought this idea was true in the Quran, and Allah knew this idea was false, then this would be a lie. If the Allah of Islam did not know this fact, they would not have the knowledge and certainly not the power to know everything. If these verses did not come from the Allah of Islam, then the Quran would have an obvious error, as it attributes this falsehood to Allah when it was not so. Of course, if the Allah of Islam does not really exist, and the true God is not the author of the Quran, then the Allah of Islam did not lie because he does not exist.Idea 4: The “spring of muddy water” is where Cyrus I looked at the Black SeaEven if Cyrus I went to the eastern shore of the Black Sea, how would the sun appear to set in the Black Sea if he had already passed the eastern shore heading south and east? We have no evidence that Cyrus ever traveled to the region that includes modern Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, etc., east of the Black Sea.A Muslim would have a slightly weaker argument if they said Cyrus saw the sun rising from the Black Sea, as he passed through to Greece, but the Quran talks about the sun setting. However, the Black Sea is not a spring, and everyone from the Egyptians to those far north knew the sun did not set in the Black Sea.Idea 5: The “spring of muddy water” is where Cyrus I looked at the Aegean SeaBut the Persians knew very well the Athenians, Spartans (original Greeks), and other Greeks. The Persians would know that the Greeks were not on the other side of the sun.Idea 6: The “spring of muddy water” is where a king looked at the Red SeaYemenis (Sabaeans/Shebans) were always aware of the Abyssinians (Ethiopians) across the river. If they thought the sun set in the Red Sea, then the Abyssinians would be the people on the other side where the sun was.Idea 7: The “spring of muddy water” is a metaphorIf this was not real but a metaphor for something else, then the Quran failed to explain that it was not real, and the idea would be misleading. Furthermore, no one can say for certain what this metaphor referred to.There is nothing in the Quran that indicates this was not real, and most early Muslims took it as literal truth. Considering that they knew the actual meaning of this from Muhammad’s followers, they were misled by Surah 18.Idea 8: Muhammad was recounting a dreamThis idea does not identify who Zul-Qarnain was. If Muhammad was recounting a dream, the sun could set wherever he wanted it to. Even if it is not clear who this mythical figure saw something totally false, and people believed it to be true, how would that teach us to believe the truth?However, if someone said they saw someone named ‘Ali doing some amazing things, and millions of people believed in him for many centuries, how could that person be a liar if they forgot to tell people that \"it was just my dream, and I did not see Ali doing this with my eyes\"?ConclusionRegardless of who Zul-Qarnain was, the Quran presents this as truth that the sun sets in a spring of muddy water. Even people 1,000 years before Muhammad knew the sun did not set in Spain. This idea was not a metaphor because no early Muslim took it as such or provided an alternative meaning as a metaphor, and all early Muslims believed the Quran was not meant to deceive.List of Quranic CommentariesArberry, Arthur J.

However, upon further reading of the Qur'an, a significant theological contradiction arises—challenging the consistency of this claim.Surah Yunus 10:90–92: Pharaoh’s Supposed ConversionSurah Yunus 10:90–92states:90: “We took the Children of Israel across the sea. Pharaoh and his soldiers pursued them out of transgression and enmity. When he was about to drown, he said,‘I believe that there is no deity except the One in whom the Children of Israel believe, and I am among the Muslims!’91:‘Now? But you disobeyed before and were among the corrupters.’92:‘So today We will preserve your body so that you may be a sign for those after you. And indeed, many among mankind are heedless of Our signs.’This passage clearly portrays Pharaoh as declaring his faith in the God of the Children of Israel and submitting at the moment of death. Many Islamic scholars, includingMuhammad AsadinThe Message of the Qur'an(Dar al-Andalus Limited, Gibraltar, 1993, p. 306, fn. 112), interpret this as Pharaoh becoming a Muslim before his death and being forgiven.The Theological Dilemma: Contradictions in the Qur'anHowever, this interpretation raises profound theological concerns when we compare it with other Qur'anic verses thatseemingly contradictthis account.1. Surah An-Nisa’ 4:17–18: Toba (Repentance) Must Be Timely17: “Verily, repentance with Allah is only for those who do evil in ignorance and then repent soon after. It is they to whom Allah will turn in forgiveness.”18: “But repentance is not accepted from those who continue to do evil deeds until death faces one of them and he says:‘Now I repent.’Nor of those who die as disbelievers; for them We have prepared a painful punishment.”Observation:According to these verses, repentance at the point of death—after a life of knowing rebellion—is not accepted. Pharaoh, who willfully opposed Moses and committed evil knowingly, clearly does not fit the Qur'anic criteria of“those who sin in ignorance”. Hence, the Qur'an itself appears toinvalidate Pharaoh’s deathbed repentance.2. Surah Ghafir 40:83–85: Repentance After Punishment Is Not Accepted83: “When their messengers came to them with clear signs, they arrogantly disbelieved in what they had been given of knowledge...”84: “Then when they saw Our punishment, they said,‘We believe in Allah alone and disbelieve in what we used to associate with Him.’”85: “But their faith was of no benefit to them once they saw Our punishment. Such is Allah’s established way with His servants. And the disbelievers then were utterly lost.”Observation:This passage underscores that faith or repentance after witnessing divine punishment isineffective and unacceptable. Again, this disqualifies Pharaoh’s last-minute submission, as it occurred preciselyafterhe had seen the punishment—the drowning in the sea.Contradiction Within the Qur'an?If, according to Surah Yunus 10:90–92, Pharaoh’s repentance is preserved as a sign, but other verses such as Surah An-Nisa 4:17–18 and Surah Ghafir 40:83–85 state that repentance at the point of death or during punishment is rejected, then the Qur’an seems to be ininternal contradiction. Does Allah forgive those who repent at the brink of death—or not?Moreover, a serious theological paradox arises concerning Muslim funerary practices. Muslims pray for forgiveness for the dead—even though, by Qur’anic logic, the dead have already tasted death and thus, are beyond repentance (as per 4:18). How, then, is forgiveness expected?The Call to Certainty in Jesus ChristAs I continued to study the Qur’an, I encountered numerous such contradictions—raising fundamental doubts about its consistency and divine authorship. Can a God who claims to be all-knowing and wise contradict Himself within His own revelation?In stark contrast, theHoly Bible is clear and consistentin presenting salvation through Jesus Christ. Jesus Himself declared:“I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.”(John 14:6)And the apostles affirmed:“Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved.”(Acts 4:12)An Invitation to Salvation Through ChristDo you want to give your life to Jesus Christ today so He may save you and give you eternal life? Receiving Jesus means acknowledging Him as the only Savior and Lord.Pray This Prayer of Salvation“O Holy God, I come before You. I confess that I am a sinner. Please forgive all my sins. I repent with all my heart. I ask that the blood of Jesus Christ, shed on the cross for me, cleanse me now—spirit, soul, and body. I open my heart. Lord Jesus Christ, I welcome You into my life. Come in by the power of Your Holy Spirit. Be my Lord and Savior now and forever. Make me the person You desire me to be. Thank You for forgiving me and saving me. I surrender to serve You all the days of my life. Satan has no authority over me—In Jesus’ Name. Amen.”If you prayed this prayer sincerely and with faith, then you are now saved, and all your sins are forgiven. The blood of Jesus now covers you.Next Steps After SalvationPray daily and speak with God–(John 15:7)Read the Bible daily–(Acts 17:11)Allow the Holy Spirit to lead your life–(Galatians 5:16–25; Romans 8:14–17)Trust God in all things–(1 Peter 5:7; Zechariah 4:6)Fellowship regularly with other believers–(Hebrews 10:25)Reject sin and live a holy life–(James 4:7–8)Witness to others about your new faith–(Matthew 10:32–33; Romans 1:16)ConclusionCongratulations on your new life in Christ. You are now anew creation. May you walk in His blessings, truth, and power from now on.In Christ’s service,Dr. Max ShimbaServant of Jesus Christ, our Great God and Savior (Titus 2:13)For Max Shimba Ministries OrgMarch 20, 2016©2016 All Rights Reserved",

He is not the God of the dead but of the living.\"Mark 12:27, \"He is not the God of the dead but the God of the living.\"The Bible assures us that God is not the God of the dead, unlike the late Muhammad in the Quran, who is prayed for daily by Allah and his angels. Let's read a verse from the Quran:Surah Al-Ahzab 56, \"Indeed, Allah and His angels send blessings upon the Prophet. O you who have believed, ask [ Allah to confer] blessing upon him and ask [ Allah to grant him] peace.\"Muslims are commanded to pray for the deceased Muhammad, who is still in his grave today, awaiting judgment from his Creator, Jesus.Imam Amirul Mu’minin Ali (a) said:\"Visit the graves of the deceased, for they feel joy when you visit them. Ask for whatever you need at the grave of your father and mother after praying for them.\" Al-Akhlaq wa al-Aadab al-Islamiyyah compiled by Hay’at Muhammad al-Amin, Qum.Imam al-Sadiq (a) urges Muslims to visit graves because the dead, through Allah, know when you visit them and feel joy when you do so. Abu Muhammad Zaynu’l ‘Abidin, Manifestations of the All-Merciful:The dead are grateful when you visit their graves, and they feel lonely when you leave.Alseraj.netThe above testimonies confirm that ISLAM is a religion of the dead, and they believe that the deceased, who have decayed and been eaten by termites in their graves, hear them and are present in those graves. But what happens on the first night when a Muslim is buried? Read this astonishing story from an authentic hadith.THE FIRST NIGHT OF A MUSLIM IN THE GRAVE:[Hasan: At-Tirmidhee from Abu Hurairah.]The Prophet of Allah (sallAllahu 'alaihi wa sallam) said, when a deceased person is buried, two angels, one black and the other blue, called Al Munkar and Al Nakeer, come to him. They talk to the deceased and ask, \"What did you say about this man?\" He says what he used to say, \"He is the servant of Allah and His messenger. I testify that there is no deity worthy of worship but Allah, and Muhammad is His servant and messenger.\" The angels then say, \"We knew you would say this,\" and his grave is widened to seventy by seventy cubits, illuminated for him, and they say, \"Sleep.\" He says, \"Let me return to my family to inform them...\"Muhammad said, \"The deceased hears the footsteps of their relatives when they leave the grave...\" [Saheeh: Al-Bukhaaree (2/422), Muslim, Ahmad, Abu Daud, an-Nasaa.ee: from Anas.]Al-Baraa b. 'Azib said, we went to a grave, and we found a man who had not yet been buried, so the Prophet of Allah asked the deceased, \"Do you submit to Allah?\"... [Saheeh: Ahmad, Abu Dawud (3/4735) Ibn Khuzaimah, al-Haakim, al-Baihaqee in 'Shu'ab ul-Imaan', ad-Diyaa: from al-Baraa.]The hadith above confirms that Islam is a RELIGION OF THE DEAD, while the Bible states that God is not the God of the dead but of the living.CONTINUE:The practice of the Prophet (Swalla Allaahu ‘alayhi wa aalihi wa sallam) after burial was to stand by the grave and say, \"Ask Allah for forgiveness for your brother and pray for him to be steadfast, for he is now being questioned.\" (Abu Daawuud).NOW MUSLIMS PRAY FOR THE DEAD WITH QURANThe dead are prayed for in the following manner:The Imam (prayer leader) stands at the head of the deceased if the deceased is a man, as established in the Hadith of Abu Ghaalibi al-Khayyaat, who said:\"I witnessed Anas bin Malik praying for a deceased man, and he stood by his head.\"The Imam also stands by the middle of the body if the deceased is a woman, as established in the Hadith of Samurah bin Jundub, who said:\"I prayed behind the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he prayed for the mother of Ka'ab...he stood by her middle.\"Then, the Imam will say the takbir (saying 'Allah is the Greatest') four or five or nine times, as all these forms have been established from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). However, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) often said the takbir four times.Allah and Muhammad continue to say, \"Pray for forgiveness for the deceased...,\" \"Pray for your brother's forgiveness and ask Allah to make him steadfast, for he is now being questioned.\" [36] as narrated by ‘Uthmaan bin ‘Affaan.This implies that you, as a Muslim, can continue to sin without worry because, upon death, your relatives will pray for your forgiveness. This is a BIG LIE.Praying for the dead encourages sinners to continue sinning, believing that after death, the church will pray for them to enter heaven. Dear friend, I tell you again, SALVATION IS NOW.Luke 16:26 says, \"And besides all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, so that those who want to pass from here to you cannot, nor can those from there pass to us.\" The Bible shows that the dead are either in paradise or in hell.WHAT DOES THE BIBLE SAY ABOUT THE DEAD?God accepts a sinner who repents wholeheartedly and sanctifies himself based on faith alone in the blood of Jesus Christ. He then grants him eternal life. 2 Corinthians 6:2 says, \"(For He says, 'In an acceptable time I have heard you, And in the day of salvation I have helped you.' Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation).\"The Bible tells us that after a person dies, they are taken to heaven or hell based on whether they accepted or rejected Christ as their Savior. For believers, death is leaving the body to be with the Lord (2 Corinthians 5:6-8; Philippians 1:23). For non-believers, death means eternal judgment in hell (Luke 16:22-23).This is where the confusion about what happens after death arises. Revelation 20:11-15 describes those in hell being cast into the lake of fire. Revelation 21 and 22 talk about a new heaven and a new earth. Therefore, it means that until the final resurrection, after death, one remains in a place resembling heaven or hell. The place where a person is to reside permanently will not change, but temporary dwellings will. Sometime after death, believers will be taken to the new heaven and new earth (Revelation 21:1), and non-believers to the lake of fire (Revelation 20:11-15). These are the eternal dwelling places based on whether one believed in Jesus Christ alone for salvation from their sins.Muslims, after death, it is judgment, and there is no praying for the dead's forgiveness. The time to set your life right is now and not to wait for intercessions after death. That is a trap set by Satan in the straight path of Allah.How about you? How prepared are you for death?Life here on earth is uncertain; we may not see tomorrow. Death comes suddenly, and the Bible warns, \"Come now, you who say, 'Today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a city, spend a year there, buy and sell, and make a profit'; whereas you do not know what will happen tomorrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapor that appears for a little time and then vanishes away.\" (James 4:13-14). The Bible also says, \"For He says: 'In an acceptable time I have heard you, And in the day of salvation I have helped you.' Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.\" (2 Corinthians 6:2). Start today, while there is still time, believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God (John 8:24). He is the way, the truth, and the life (John 14:6). Only in the name of Jesus Christ can we be saved (Acts 4:11-12). Repent of all your sins (Acts 17:30-31). Confess that Jesus Christ is the Son of God (Acts 8:37). Be buried with Him in baptism for the remission of your sins (Romans 6:4; Acts 22:16). Then serve Christ in His Church for the rest of your life, and you will be blessed.Today we have learned the difference between DEATH in Islam and Christianity. Muslims believe in praying for the dead's forgiveness, while Christians believe that salvation is now.God bless you.I am Dr. Max Shimba, a servant of Jesus Christ, the Great God.For Max Shimba Ministries Org,MAX SHIMBA MINISTRIES ORG ©2016.

    "full_content": "JESUS IS GOD ACCORDING TO THE QURAN (PART ONE)By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteOriginally written on January 20, 2016AbstractThis paper seeks to establish, through textual and theological analysis, that the Qur'an itself ascribes divine attributes to Jesus Christ (ʿĪsā ibn Maryam). While Islamic theology denies the divinity of Jesus and emphasizes strict monotheism (tawḥīd), a careful reading of several Qur'anic passages reveals that Jesus shares essential divine qualities reserved only for God (Allāh). This comparative analysis between the Qur'an and the Bible demonstrates internal theological consistency regarding the divinity of Christ.IntroductionMuslim apologists and Islamic scholars frequently argue that Jesus Christ cannot be divine because, in their view,God cannot be bornor take on human form. This argument is often emphasized in publicdaʿwahforums and interreligious debates. However, the Qur'an, when examined closely, attributes to Jesus qualities that belong exclusively to God.This study investigates whether Jesus possesses divine characteristics according to the Qur'an, using both Islamic and biblical sources to evaluate the nature of His divinity.1. GOD AS KING1.1 The Qur’anic TestimonyIn the Qur'an, one of the exalted attributes of God is that He is“The King.”Qur’an 59:23“He is Allah, besides Whom there is no deity, the Sovereign, the Holy One, the Source of Peace, the Guardian of Faith, the Preserver, the Mighty, the Compeller, the Supreme. Glory be to Allah above all that they associate with Him.” (Qur’an 59:23,Al-Hashr)Here, the attribute“The King” (Al-Malik)is reserved solely for God, denoting absolute sovereignty and rulership over all creation.1.2 The Biblical TestimonyThe Bible attributes the same sovereign title to Jesus Christ:Revelation 17:14 (NKJV)“These will make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them, for He is Lord of lords and King of kings; and those who are with Him are called, chosen, and faithful.”Jesus is explicitly called“King of kings,”a title parallel to the Qur’anic divine titleAl-Malik. Therefore, both the Qur’an and the Bible affirm that kingship belongs to the divine, and Jesus is identified with this divine sovereignty.Conclusion:If the Qur’an declares thatGod aloneis King, and the Bible reveals Jesus asKing of kings, the implication is clear — Jesus shares the kingship that belongs only to God.2. GOD AS HOLY2.1 The Qur’anic TestimonyThe second divine attribute of God mentioned in the Qur’an is that He is“The Holy One” (Al-Quddūs):Qur’an 59:23“He is Allah, besides Whom there is no deity, the Sovereign, the Holy One, the Source of Peace...” (Al-Hashr 59:23)Holiness, according to the Qur’an, is an attribute that belongs exclusively to Allah — absolute moral and spiritual perfection.2.2 The Qur’anic Declaration of Jesus’ HolinessHowever, the Qur’an also identifies Jesus with the same attribute of holiness:Qur’an 19:19“He (the angel) said: I am only a messenger of your Lord to announce to you the gift of a pure son.” (Arabic: ghulāman zakiyyā) — interpreted asa holy son.Islamic commentators such as Al-Tabari and Al-Jalalayn interpretzakiyyāas “sinless” or “pure,” indicating that Jesus (ʿĪsā) is uniquely holy among all human beings.2.3 Theological ImplicationHoliness belongs solely to God, as established in the Qur’an (59:23). Yet, the same Qur’an attributes holiness to Jesus, a title not shared by any other prophet. This correspondence implies the divine nature of Jesus within the Qur’anic framework.3. GOD AS LORD3.1 The Qur’anic TestimonyAnother exclusive title of divinity in the Qur’an is“Lord” (Rabb):Qur’an 39:29“Allah presents an example: a man belonging to many disputing partners and another belonging exclusively to one man — are they equal in comparison? Praise be to Allah! But most of them do not know.”Here, “Lord” signifies the exclusive authority and ownership of God over His creation.3.2 Jesus as “Lord” in the Qur’anIn another passage, the Qur’an ascribes lordship to Jesus:Qur’an 3:39“While he was standing in prayer in the chamber, the angels called to him: ‘Indeed, Allah gives you good tidings of John, confirming a word from Allah, noble, chaste, and a prophet from among the righteous.’”The “Word from Allah” (Kalimatun minhu) refers to Jesus (ʿĪsā ibn Maryam), who is elsewhere calledthe Word of God(Qur’an 3:45). The same verse identifies Him as “noble” and “lordly” (sayyidan), an Arabic term connoting leadership, honor, and authority — all elements of divine lordship.3.3 Biblical ConfirmationRevelation 17:14“The Lamb will overcome them, for He is Lord of lords and King of kings.”The Bible, therefore, identifies Jesus asLord of lords, aligning with the Qur’anic notion ofRabbas the supreme Lord. Both scriptures attest to Jesus’ divine lordship.ConclusionMuslim theologians often pose the question:“Is Jesus God?”The Qur’an itself provides an affirmative answer. Jesus Christ possesses all the primary divine attributes acknowledged in the Qur’an:He isKing(Qur’an 59:23; Revelation 17:14).He isHoly(Qur’an 19:19; Qur’an 59:23).He isLord(Qur’an 3:39; Qur’an 39:29; Revelation 17:14).Hence, by the Qur’an’s own testimony, Jesus Christ embodies the essential qualities of divinity. The convergence of Qur’anic and Biblical revelation therefore substantiates the Christian doctrine thatJesus is indeed God.BibliographyThe Holy Bible (New King James Version).Nashville: Thomas Nelson, 1982.The Qur’an.Translated by Abdullah Yusuf Ali.

Let us read the Quran first.Quran 59:23:He is Allah, besides Whom there is no god, the King, the Holy, the Giver of peace, the Granter of security, Guardian over all, the Mighty, the Compeller, the Supreme; Glory be to Allah from that which they associate (with Him).Now, let us see if Jesus truly has this attribute of King, which is a unique attribute of God according to the Quran.The Holy Bible says the following about Jesus Christ:Revelation 17:14They will make war against the Lamb, but the Lamb will overcome them, because he is Lord of lords and King of kings.In this verse, we read that Jesus is called “King of Kings,” which is an attribute of Almighty God as witnessed in Quran Surah 59:23. Therefore, Allah and the Quran have affirmed that Jesus is God because the Bible confirms that Jesus is the King of Kings in Revelation 17:14.Let us continue with another piece of evidence from the Quran which assures us that Jesus is God.GOD IS HOLYThe Second Attribute according to the Quran: God is Holy.Does Jesus have this attribute of “Holy”? Let us read the Quran first:Quran 59:23He is Allah, besides Whom there is no god, the King, the Holy, the Giver of peace, the Granter of security, Guardian over all, the Mighty, the Compeller, the Supreme; Glory be to Allah from that which they associate (with Him).In the Quran, we have read that one of the attributes of God is “Holy.” Does Jesus have this attribute of holiness?Go to that same Quran,19:19:The angel said, \"Indeed, I am only a messenger of your Lord to give you a pure son\"—Isa (Jesus) son of Mary.That same Quran confirms and answers us that Jesus, known as Isa son of Maryam in the Quran, is the Holy Son. Therefore, this attribute of holiness, which belongs to God alone, we read in the Quran, which was revealed by Allah, that Jesus possesses it. Jesus is called the Holy Son.THE LORD IS ALMIGHTY GODThe Third Attribute according to the Quran: The Lord is Almighty God.Let us open the Quran and read about the Lord:Quran 3:39While he was standing in prayer in the chamber, the angels called to him: \"Allah gives you glad tidings of Yahya (John), confirming (the word) from Allah, noble, chaste, and a prophet among the righteous.\"Quran 39:29Allah presents an example: a slave owned by quarreling partners and another belonging exclusively to one man—are they equal in comparison? Praise be to Allah! But most of them do not know.Quran 39:29 says that Almighty God is Lord, and that is a praiseworthy attribute of God. Furthermore, that same Quran (Quran 3:39) says that Isa son of Maryam is the Word from Allah and is Lord. The Quran answers us that the attribute of Lord, which belongs to God alone, is given to Jesus. Now let us read the Bible for more evidence about Jesus being Lord.Revelation 17:14They will make war against the Lamb, but the Lamb will overcome them, because he is Lord of lords and King of kings.In Revelation, we read that the Lamb, who is Jesus Christ, is called Lord of Lords. Therefore, this attribute of “Lord,” which is exclusively God’s, we read in the Quran, which was revealed by Allah, that Jesus is Lord and has acquired it. Likewise, in the Holy Bible, we have read that Jesus is called Lord, which is an exclusive attribute of God according to the Quran.Today I have answered the question of Muslims: Is Jesus God? The Quran and Allah both affirm that Jesus is God because Jesus possesses all the attributes and/or honors of God.In His service,Dr. Maxwell ShimbaCopyright © Max Shimba Ministries 2013",

This act of faith brings spiritual life and physical health to the believer where it was lacking. Remember, many who were healed of their physical ailments were also healed in their souls.So, why did Allah's command to Jibril to pray for the healing of His Prophet Muhammad from an illness caused by eating poison not work?Thus, healing is not performed by any person but by God. Even specialist doctors do not heal; they only provide treatment. The healer is God. Only the servants of God act as a bridge or instrument to bring about the healing released by the Lord to the needy person.LET'S NOW READ ABOUT ALLAH AND JIBRIL IN THEIR ATTEMPT TO HEAL MUHAMMAD:Ibn Sa'd, Page 265:Aisha, the wife of the Prophet Muhammad, used to say, \"When the Prophet of Allah was ill, Jibril would pray for Muhammad to Allah by saying these words: 'In the name of Allah, may He heal you from every illness and pain and from all those who are evil against you and those who wish you harm. You will be healed.'\"Did the name of Allah heal Muhammad? Let's read the Sahih hadith as brought by Al Bukhari:MUHAMMAD'S RESPONSE AFTER BEING PRAYED FOR HEALING BY ALLAH/JIBRIL:Bukhari's Hadith 5.713:Narrated by 'Aisha:The Prophet Muhammad, when he was ill and taken by death, used to say, \"O Aisha, I still feel severe pain from the poisoned food I ate at Khaibar, and now I feel as if my aorta is being cut from that poison I ate.\"Can God pray and fail? Why did the healing prayers of Allah and Jibril for Muhammad not work?NOW LET'S READ ABOUT JESUS IN THE BIBLE, DID HE HEAL PEOPLE?“When Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw Peter’s mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever. He touched her hand, and the fever left her; and she got up and began to wait on him.” Matthew 8:14-15The Bible does not tell us that Jesus prayed for this woman; instead, we see that Jesus touched her hand, and the fever left her. Just a touch from a man of God is sufficient medicine, even if he does not pray because the anointing is within him. Even Peter could heal the sick with his shadow alone due to the anointing (Acts 5:15).THE IMPORTANCE OF PUTTING YOUR FAITH IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST“Now Peter and John were going up to the temple at the time of prayer—at three in the afternoon. Now a man who was lame from birth was being carried to the temple gate called Beautiful, where he was put every day to beg from those going into the temple courts. When he saw Peter and John about to enter, he asked them for money. Peter looked straight at him, as did John. Then Peter said, 'Look at us!' So the man gave them his attention, expecting to get something from them. Then Peter said, 'Silver or gold I do not have, but what I do have I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk.' Taking him by the right hand, he helped him up, and instantly the man’s feet and ankles became strong. He jumped to his feet and began to walk.” (Acts 3:1-8)If you follow the story of this healed crippled man, you will see that he had been that way from birth and was over forty years old when he was healed (Acts 4:22).What was the secret of this miracle? Did this crippled man get healed by the power of Peter and John or by the power of the name of Jesus Christ?I ask these questions because many people, when they see someone being used by God in healing, put their faith in that person instead of putting their faith in the name of Jesus Christ.And that’s what happened when this crippled man was healed; the people in the temple were amazed at Peter and John as if the crippled man had been healed by their power, which was not true. When Peter saw this, he decided to explain the truth to the people; he said:“While the man held on to Peter and John, all the people were astonished and came running to them in the place called Solomon’s Colonnade. When Peter saw this, he said to them: ‘Fellow Israelites, why does this surprise you? Why do you stare at us as if by our own power or godliness we had made this man walk?’” (Acts 3:11-12).Peter was doing something important here by helping to change the people's mindset that the power to heal this man was from Peter and John, which was not true. If this power was not theirs, what was the secret of this miracle? Peter continued to say:“The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his servant Jesus... By faith in the name of Jesus, this man whom you see and know was made strong. It is Jesus’ name and the faith that comes through him that has completely healed him, as you can all see.” (Acts 3:13-16).Consider these words of Peter: \"By faith in the name of Jesus, this man whom you see and know was made strong.\" Peter and John put their faith in the name of Jesus Christ. They were confident in their hearts that the secret of miracles lies in the name of Jesus Christ—that's why when they met this crippled man, they commanded him to walk in that name!Put your faith in the name of Jesus Christ if you want to see the signs and miracles of Jesus Christ in your life and those you minister to. Knowing this, the first disciples of Jesus Christ, when they were forbidden to \"speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus\" by the high priest Annas, they prayed, saying: \"...Now, Lord, consider their threats and enable your servants to speak your word with great boldness. Stretch out your hand to heal and perform signs and wonders through the name of your holy servant Jesus.\" (Acts 4:18, 29-31)It is important to tell and remind people of the importance of putting their faith in the name of Jesus Christ if they want to see the hand of the Lord healing, performing signs, and miracles.Dear reader, why waste your time with traditional healers or charmers?

Now, I will present two verses from the BIBLE and then two verses from the Quran, and afterward I will ask you a question.WHEN DID THE FLOOD OCCUR ACCORDING TO THE BIBLE?Genesis 7:6“And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth.”The BIBLE, which Muslims say is not from God, states that Noah wassix hundred (600)years old when the flood occurred. It also tells us Noah’s age after the flood.Genesis 9:28“And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.”HOW OLD WAS NOAH WHEN HE DIED?Genesis 9:29“And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.”We are told by the BIBLE that Noah livedthree hundred and fifty (350)years after the flood and died at the age ofnine hundred and fifty (950)years. That is the total lifespan of Noah — he did not live beyond those years.Now let us go to the Quran, and then I will ask my questions.WHEN DID THE FLOOD OCCUR ACCORDING TO THE QURAN?Quran 29:14وَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا نُوحًا إِلَى قَوْمِهِ فَلَبِثَ فِيهِمْ أَلْفَ سَنَةٍ إِلَّا خَمْسِينَ عَامًا فَأَخَذَهُمُ الطُّوفَانُ وَهُمْ ظَالِمُون“And indeed, We sent Noah to his people, and he stayed among them a thousand years minus fifty. Then the flood seized them while they were wrongdoers.”Quran 29:15فَأَنجَيْنَاهُ وَأَصْحَابَ السَّفِينَةِ وَجَعَلْنَاهَا آيَةً لِّلْعَالَمِين“But We saved him and the people of the ship, and We made it a sign for all the worlds.”FULL ANALYSISThe BIBLE says the flood happened when Noah was600 years old.The Quran says Noah lived950 years among his people before the flood, which equals the age the BIBLE says Noah livedin total.The BIBLE says Noah lived350 years after the floodand died at age950.But the Quran says the flood cameafter Noah had already lived 950 yearsamong his people — which equals the Bible’s age of his death.QUESTIONSSince the Quran tells us that Noah was950 years old when the flood came, while the Bible says he was only600 years old, and the Bible says hedied at 950, then according to the Quran,how many years did Noah live after those 950 years at the time of the flood?Or did he die in the very same year of the flood, being950 years old, the age the Quran states he had reached when the flood happened?NOTE:The answers must come strictly from the Quran — the book you Muslims claim is from God.If the Quran is not sufficient, say so, and I will allow you to use even newspapers or magazines.Prepared byAbel Suleiman ShiliwaForMax Shimba Ministries Org.Dated: October 16, 2015",

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteMonday, August 17, 2015Jesus Existed Before the Creation of the World: A Theological ExpositionAbstractThis study presents a Christological exposition of the eternal pre-existence of Jesus Christ. Drawing from key New Testament texts, includingJohn 8:58,John 17:5,Colossians 1:16–17, andJohn 1:3, the article affirms that Jesus’ existence precedes creation itself, thereby substantiating His divine nature. This theological truth challenges Islamic and other humanistic claims that reduce Jesus to a mere prophet or moral teacher. The analysis demonstrates, through both scriptural and logical reasoning, that Jesus Christ is co-eternal with God the Father, and thus, fully divine.1. IntroductionOne of the profound declarations of Jesus Christ recorded in the Gospel of John challenges human understanding of time, existence, and divinity. InJohn 8:58, Jesus proclaims:“Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I am.” (John 8:58, ESV)This statement stands as one of the most explicit affirmations of Christ’s eternal nature and divine identity. It implies that Jesus’ existence transcends human temporality, affirming His pre-incarnate being before Abraham and, as further Scripture attests, even before the creation of the world. Such claims are unique to Jesus; no prophet or religious leader—whether from Judaism, Islam, or any other tradition—has ever claimed pre-existence prior to creation itself.2. Jesus’ Declaration of Pre-ExistenceThe expression“I am” (Greek: ἐγώ εἰμι, egō eimi)inJohn 8:58is not a mere grammatical assertion but a theological one. It directly echoes the divine self-identification inExodus 3:14, where God revealed Himself to Moses saying, “I AM WHO I AM.” This linguistic and theological connection implies that Jesus identified Himself with Yahweh, the self-existent God of Israel.By claiming existence “before Abraham,” Jesus not only placed Himself above one of the patriarchs revered by both Jews and Muslims but also affirmed His eternal continuity. The Jewish audience immediately recognized the divine implications of this claim, as evidenced by their attempt to stone Him for blasphemy (John 8:59).3. Jesus’ Glory Before CreationJesus further substantiates His pre-existence in His prayer recorded inJohn 17:5:“And now, Father, glorify Me in Your own presence with the glory that I had with You before the world existed.” (John 17:5, ESV)Here, Jesus speaks of a shared glory with the Father prior to the creation of the cosmos. This pre-creation relationship affirms the eternal fellowship between the Father and the Son. It also reveals that Jesus’ divine identity was not conferred upon Him at birth or baptism, as some heresies (e.g., Adoptionism) have proposed, but is intrinsic to His nature.4. Christ’s Role in CreationThe Apostle Paul reinforces this divine pre-existence inColossians 1:16–17:“For by Him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities—all things were created through Him and for Him. And He is before all things, and in Him all things hold together.”Similarly,John 1:3declares:“All things were made through Him, and without Him was not anything made that was made.”Both passages attribute the act of creation directly to Christ, identifying Him as the divine agent through whom all existence came into being. Therefore, the New Testament presents Jesus not as a created being but as the Creator Himself. This identification aligns with the Old Testament revelation of God as the sole Creator (Genesis 1:1; Isaiah 44:24), indicating that Jesus shares the same divine essence.5. Theological ImplicationsFrom these scriptural evidences, several theological conclusions can be drawn:Jesus’ Eternity: Christ’s existence before creation affirms His eternal nature, distinguishing Him from all created beings.Jesus as Co-Creator: Creation itself bears witness to Christ’s divine authority and power.Jesus’ Unity with the Father: His request for restored glory (John 17:5) underscores the ontological unity of the Godhead.Refutation of Islamic Christology: The Qur’an acknowledges that only God existed before creation (Surah Al-Hadid 57:3). Since Jesus affirms pre-existence before creation, this logically places Him in the divine category, contradicting the Islamic claim that He was merely a prophet.Thus, the pre-existence of Christ is not a peripheral doctrine but central to Christian theology, confirming thatJesus is God manifested in the flesh(1 Timothy 3:16).6. ConclusionIn conclusion, the words of Jesus,“Before Abraham was, I am”(John 8:58), and His prayer for restored glory (John 17:5) provide irrefutable evidence of His divine pre-existence. The testimony ofColossians 1:16–17andJohn 1:3further cements His identity as the Creator and sustainer of all things. Therefore, Jesus Christ is not a mere prophet or moral teacher but the eternal Word (Logos), co-existent and co-equal with God the Father.Indeed, Jesus lived before the world was created—because He is God.ReferencesThe Holy Bible, English Standard Version (ESV).The Holy Qur’an, Surah Al-Hadid 57:3.Augustine of Hippo.On the Trinity.

    "full_content": "IF JESUS WAS GOD, THEN TO WHOM WAS HE PRAYING?By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological Institute(Originally written: August 17, 2015 – Revised and Arranged Academically and Scholarly)AbstractThe question of Jesus’ divinity and His act of prayer to the Father has been a theological point of contention across various religious traditions. Critics—especially from Islamic scholarship and Jehovah’s Witnesses—often question how Jesus could be God while simultaneously praying to another being. This paper provides a systematic theological exposition to clarify the biblical and doctrinal understanding of Jesus’ dual nature as both fully God and fully man, and explains the theological significance of His prayers within the framework of the eternal relationship between the Father and the Son.1. IntroductionThe inquiry,“If Jesus was God, then whom was He praying to?”has perplexed many believers and critics alike. This question often arises in interfaith dialogues, particularly with Muslim scholars and Jehovah’s Witnesses, who argue that Jesus’ prayer life contradicts His divinity. For instance, they refer to Jesus’ prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane (Matthew 26:36–46) as evidence that He could not be divine if He prayed to another.However, such reasoning fails to consider the Christian theological understanding of theIncarnation—that Jesus Christ possessed two natures: divine and human. Therefore, this discussion must be approached with a sound grasp of the doctrine of theHypostatic Union, where Jesus Christ is bothfully Godandfully man.2. The Eternal Relationship Between the Father and the SonBefore the Incarnation, the relationship betweenGod the FatherandGod the Sonwas eternal. Scripture attests to this eternal coexistence (John 1:1–3; 17:5). Isaiah 9:6 prophetically declares:“For unto us a child is born, unto us a Son is given…”The Son was not created; He wasgiven—eternally existent within the Godhead. This Son, together with the Father and the Holy Spirit, forms theTrinity—one God in three coequal and coeternal Persons. The Trinity does not imply three gods, but one divine essence shared among three distinct Persons (Matthew 28:19; John 10:30).Jesus affirmed this unity when He declared,“I and the Father are one”(John 10:30). This oneness denotes unity of essence, not identity of personhood. Thus, when Jesus prayed, He was not praying to Himself, but communicating within the eternal fellowship of the Godhead—a relational act between divine Persons, not a contradiction of divinity.3. The Dual Nature of Christ: Divine and HumanThe doctrine of theHypostatic Unionteaches that Jesus Christ is both fully God and fully man (John 1:14; Philippians 2:5–11). When the Word became flesh, He did not cease to be God; rather, He voluntarily set aside His heavenly glory to assume human nature. Paul explains this beautifully in Philippians 2:7–8:“He made Himself nothing, taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness.”As a man, Jesus experienced the full range of human limitations—hunger, fatigue, pain, and even the need for prayer. His prayers were the natural expression of His human dependence upon the Father. AsGod, He remained omnipotent; asman, He modeled perfect obedience and humility.4. The Purpose and Meaning of Jesus’ PrayersIn His earthly ministry, Jesus frequently withdrew to pray (Mark 1:35; Luke 6:12). His prayers were not signs of weakness or ignorance but manifestations of His humanity and obedience to the Father’s redemptive plan (Hebrews 5:8).In John 17—the “High Priestly Prayer”—Jesus prays for the glorification of the Father and the sanctification of His disciples. This prayer reveals deep relational intimacy within the Trinity, not subordination in essence.By praying, Jesus demonstrated:Dependence in Humanity– He relied on the Father’s will and strength as the perfect man.Submission in Obedience– He aligned His human will to the divine plan of salvation (Matthew 26:39).Exemplary Devotion– He provided a model of prayerful life for all believers, underscoring total reliance on God (John 11:41–42).Thus, Jesus’ prayers affirm—not deny—His divine mission and perfect obedience as the incarnate Son.5. Theological Implications of the Incarnation and PrayerThe act of Jesus praying does not diminish His divinity. Rather, it illuminates themystery of the Incarnation, wherein God entered human experience without surrendering His divine nature. His prayer in Gethsemane, “Not My will, but Yours be done,” (Luke 22:42) epitomizes the alignment of His human will with divine will, not a conflict between two deities.Through His prayers, Christ exemplified perfect communion between God and humanity, achieving the reconciliation of mankind through the cross (2 Corinthians 5:19). His resurrection validated His divine authority and fulfilled His redemptive purpose (Romans 1:4).6. ConclusionTherefore, there is no theological contradiction in Jesus, the Son of God, praying to the Father. Within the unity of the Trinity, communication and relationship exist eternally. As man, Jesus prayed to the Father for strength, wisdom, and guidance; as God, He revealed the perfect model of obedience and faithfulness.Jesus’ dual nature allows us to understand His prayers not as evidence against His divinity, but as demonstrations of His redemptive mission and relational unity within the Godhead. Indeed,Jesus Christ is God—eternal, incarnate, crucified, and risen.ReferencesThe Holy Bible, New International Version (NIV).Isaiah 9:6; John 1:1–14; John 10:30; John 17; Philippians 2:5–11; Hebrews 5:8; Matthew 26:36–46; Mark 1:35; Luke 6:12; Romans 1:4; 2 Corinthians 5:19.Augustine,On the Trinity.Trans.

    "full_content": "JESUS AS THE SON OF GOD: WHAT DOES IT MEAN?By Dr. Maxwell Shimba – Shimba Theological Institute(Originally written August 15, 2015)IntroductionOne of the most persistent questions raised by Muslim scholars and believers concerns the Christian confession thatJesus Christ is the Son of God. Muslims often ask:How can Jesus be the Son of God?How can God have a Son without a wife?These questions reveal a misunderstanding of the Christian doctrine of divine sonship. The phrase“Son of God”does not imply a biological relationship or a physical act of procreation, as understood in human terms. Instead, it signifies a profound theological and spiritual truth rooted in divine revelation.1. How Is Jesus the Son of God?Jesus Christ is not the Son of God through human parentage or natural generation. God did not marry or engage in a physical relationship with Mary to produce a son. The Bible clearly rejects any notion of divine-human sexual union. Rather, Jesus’ sonship expressesGod’s self-revelation in human form.As the Gospel of John affirms:“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God… The Word became flesh and dwelt among us” (John 1:1, 14).Thus, the title “Son of God” emphasizes that Jesus isGod manifested in the flesh—the visible image of the invisible God.2. How Can God Have a Son Without a Wife?This question presupposes a human and material understanding of divine sonship. According toLuke 1:35, the angel Gabriel explained the mystery of Christ’s conception to Mary:“The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be called holy, the Son of God.”Here, the Scripture explicitly states thatJesus’ conception was by the Holy Spirit, not through human means. The divine power of the Holy Spirit, who is God, brought about the incarnation of the Son. Therefore, Jesus is calledthe Son of Godbecause His origin is divine.Mary was told that the holy child she would bear would be called“the Son of God”—not because of a biological act, but because of the supernatural act of divine creation within her womb.3. Jesus Affirms His Sonship Before the High PriestDuring His trial before the Jewish High Priest, Jesus was directly questioned about His divine identity:“The high priest said to Him, ‘I charge You under oath by the living God: Tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God.’ Jesus replied, ‘You have said it yourself; but I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven’” (Matthew 26:63–64).In this passage,Jesus did not deny being the Son of God. His response, instead, confirmed it. The Jewish leaders understood this asa claim to divinityand accused Him of blasphemy (Matthew 26:65–66).4. The Jewish Acknowledgment of Jesus’ ClaimWhen Jesus was brought before Pontius Pilate, the Jewish leaders declared:“We have a law, and according to that law He must die because He claimed to be the Son of God” (John 19:7).This verse is significant because it demonstrates thateven the Jewish accusers recognized that Jesus claimed divine sonship. Their accusation of blasphemy arose precisely because they understood“Son of God”to mean“equal with God.”In Jewish thought, to call oneself the Son of God was to claimoneness in nature and essence with God Himself—a claim intolerable to those who rejected His divinity.The writer of Hebrews affirms this same truth:“The Son is the radiance of God’s glory and the exact representation of His being, sustaining all things by His powerful word” (Hebrews 1:3).Thus, Jesus’ title asthe Son of Godexpresses Hisdivine essence, eternal relationship with the Father, and His participation in divine glory.5. The Meaning of “Son” as Manifestation, Not BiologyIn Scripture, the term“son”is sometimes used metaphorically to describe character or nature rather than literal descent. For example, inJohn 17:12, Judas Iscariot is called“the son of perdition,”not because perdition gave birth to him, but becausehe embodied destruction.Similarly, Jesus as theSon of Godmeans Hemanifests God’s nature and essence. He is God revealing Himself in human form—divine truth made visible to humankind.ConclusionThis theological exploration clarifies that the Christian confession—“Jesus is the Son of God”—does not imply physical generation but expressesdivine revelation and incarnation. Jesus is God manifest in the flesh, conceived by the Holy Spirit, and acknowledged even by His accusers as claiming equality with God.Therefore, the question that Muslims frequently raise—“How can God have a Son?”—finds its answer in Scripture:God’s Sonship isnot biological but spiritual and ontological. It reveals the mystery of God’s love, self-expression, and redemption through Jesus Christ.Truly, Jesus is the Son of God.ReferencesThe Holy Bible, New International Version (NIV)John 1:1, 14Luke 1:35Matthew 26:63–66John 19:7Hebrews 1:3John 17:121 Chronicles 24:15(referenced in context)Dr. Maxwell ShimbaFounder, Shimba Theological InstituteMax Shimba MinistriesAugust 15, 2015",

    "full_content": "Title:Celebrating the Prophet Muhammad’s Birthday (Maulid) Is Paganism and Not Mentioned in the Qur’anBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba – Shimba Theological InstitutePublished: Saturday, August 15, 2015Introductory Questions to Muslims:Which verse in the Qur’an commands Muslims to celebrate the Prophet Muhammad’s birthday (Maulid)?Whom do Muslims truly follow—Allah, Muhammad, the Qur’an, the Sahih Hadith, the Five Pillars, or Sharia?IntroductionThe pagan nature of Maulid (the celebration of the Prophet Muhammad’s birthday) can be understood by examining three major areas:The history of Maulid.The lack of any specific birth date for Prophet Muhammad in the Qur’an or authentic Hadith.Scholarly consensus on the pagan origins of Maulid.(a) The History of MaulidThis history reveals three key facts:Neither Prophet Muhammad nor his companions celebrated Maulid.The celebration of Maulid began over 300 years after the Prophet’s death.The originators of Maulid are linked to heretical or pagan sects.Anyone who examines the life of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and the history of his Companions, their successors (Tabi’in), and those who followed them faithfully up to the year 350 Hijri will not find any record of scholars, rulers, or common people celebrating Maulid. As noted by Al-Hafidh As-Sakhawi:“The practice of celebrating the Prophet’s birthday was not carried out by the righteous predecessors of the first three generations. Indeed, it was introduced much later.”(Subulul Hudaa war Rashaad by As-Salihiy, Vol. 1, p. 439).So, when did Maulid start?According to Sunni scholar Al-Imam Al-Maqrizi:“During the rule of the Fatimids—who were Shi’a Isma’ilis—in Egypt, Maulid was instituted as part of numerous annual festivals. They introduced celebrations for the Prophet, Ali, Fatimah, Hasan, Husayn, and their living Imam.”(Al-Khutwat, Vol. 1, p. 490)In another work, Al-Maqrizi writes:“During the month of Rabi’ al-Awwal, people were compelled to light candles in streets and alleys in Egypt as part of Maulid celebrations.”These practices began with the Fatimid rulers, particularly the Banu ‘Ubayd dynasty, falsely claiming descent from Fatimah. Scholars such as Shaykh Muhammad Bakhit al-Muti’i, Shaykh ‘Ali Mahfudh, and Shaykh Isma’il al-Ansari confirm this innovation in their works. According to ‘Ali Mahfudh:“The first people to introduce the Prophet’s Maulid in Cairo were the Fatimid Shi’a rulers in the 4th century Hijri. They celebrated six Maulids: those of the Prophet, Ali, Fatimah, Hasan, Husayn, and the ruling Imam.”(Al-Ibda’ Fii Madh-har al-Ibtidaa‘, p. 251)Scholarly Opinions on the Fatimid DynastyImam Shaamah, a historian and hadith scholar, describes the Fatimids as:Claiming false descent from Fatimah to justify their rule.Their founder, ‘Ubaydullah, is described as a Magian (Zoroastrian), a heretic, or even a Jew by descent.The dynasty promoted innovations and suppressed Sunni scholars.They manipulated religion for power and propagated extreme Shia ideology.The dynasty ruled from 299 to 567 Hijri and created fertile ground for the rise of heretical sects like the Druze, Hashashiyyun (Assassins), and others. The Crusaders exploited this religious disunity until Salahuddin al-Ayyubi restored Sunni orthodoxy and liberated the lands.Quotations from Muslim Scholars on the FatimidsAccording to Imam Shaamah:“They were apostates disguised as nobles. Their lineage was fabricated. They killed scholars, allied with Crusaders, and desecrated religious teachings.”(Ar-Rawdhatayn Fiy Akhbaar Dawlatayn, pp. 200–202)The so-called Mahdi of the dynasty is described as:A blasphemer who insulted the Prophet’s wives publicly.Claimed by his followers to be either the Mahdi, a prophet, or even Allah Himself.Shaykh Abdullah Saleh Farsy confirms:“The celebration of Maulid originated with the Shi’a Isma’ilis, who ruled Sunni lands from 297 to 567 Hijri. After their fall, the Sunnis adopted the Maulid of the Prophet and abandoned the others.”(Tafsiri ya Mawlid Barzanji, Zanzibar, p. iv)The first recorded Sunni celebration of Maulid occurred under King Muzaffar al-Din in Iraq in the 6th century Hijri, over 600 years after the Prophet’s birth.(b) No Authentic Qur'anic or Hadith Evidence for the Prophet’s Birth DateThe exact date of the Prophet’s birth is unknown. It is neither mentioned in the Qur’an nor in any authentic Hadith. Scholars differ widely on the year and date.Safi-ur-Rahman Mubarakpuri writes:“Muhammad (peace be upon him) was born on a Monday, 9th Rabi’ al-Awwal, Year of the Elephant (571 CE).”(Ar-Rahiq Al-Makhtum, p. 62)Sirajur Rahman notes:“The event of the Elephant occurred 55 days before the Prophet’s birth, in Muharram. This corresponds to late February or early March 571 CE.”(Al-Mustafa, 1993, p. 11)Thus, even scholars can only speculate the Prophet was born sometime between 25th Safar and 25th Rabi’ al-Awwal.(c) Scholarly Evidence Declaring Maulid as Pagan InnovationSeveral scholars have denounced Maulid as aBid’ah(innovation):Imam Al-ShatibiinAl-I’tisam (1/34)listed Maulid as one of the religious innovations that must be rejected.Imam Al-Fakihaniwrote a full treatise condemning Maulid.Imam Al-Haj Al-Malikicalled Maulid a bid’ah inAl-Mudkhal (2/11–12).Abu At-Tayyib Shams al-Haq Al-Azimabadiand his teacherBashir al-Din Qanujicondemned it inGhayat al-Kalam fi Ibtal Amal al-Mawlid wal-Qiyam.Abu ‘Abdullah Al-Haffar Al-Malikifrom Morocco stated:“No generation of pious Muslims ever celebrated the Prophet’s birthday, including the Companions. They never distinguished that night for any specific activity.”Final Questions for Reflection:Where in the Qur’an does it command Muslims to celebrate the Prophet Muhammad’s birthday?Where in the Qur’an is the date of Muhammad’s birth or life explicitly mentioned?Why do Muslims celebrate something the Qur’an is silent about?Whom do Muslims truly follow—Allah, Muhammad, the Qur’an, Sahih Hadith, the Five Pillars, or the Sharia?Conclusion:The celebration of the Prophet Muhammad’s birthday (Maulid) isnot Islamic but pagan in origin. It isnot found in the Qur’an,was never practiced by the Prophet or his Companions, andwas introduced centuries later by a heretical sect. True devotion to the Prophet is not throughunauthorized innovationsbut throughadherence to the Qur’an and authentic Sunnah.Max Shimba MinistriesDr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

    "full_content": "The Absence of Imams, Sheikhs, and Ustaadhs in the Qur’an: A Theological InquiryBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteOriginally written: August 14, 2015 | Revised and expanded, 2025AbstractThis paper examines a crucial theological question concerning the structure and legitimacy of Islamic religious leadership. While Islam today recognizes figures such asImams,Sheikhs, andUstaadhsas authoritative leaders and teachers within the Muslim community, the Qur’an itself provides no explicit reference or divine instruction establishing these roles. In contrast, the Holy Bible delineates clear qualifications and divine mandates for church leadership, such as bishops (episkopoi), pastors, elders (presbyteroi), and deacons (diakonoi). This study therefore questions the Qur’anic foundation of Islamic clerical titles and compares them with the biblical model of ecclesiastical order, ultimately affirming the biblical structure as divinely ordained and the Islamic hierarchy as humanly fabricated.1. IntroductionThe claim that Islam is a divinely established faith demands that its structure and doctrines be traceable directly to revelation. However, upon examination, we find that the Qur’an never mentions nor prescribes the existence ofImams,Sheikhs, orUstaadhsas formal religious offices. Contemporary Islam, however, heavily depends upon these figures for teaching, interpretation, and leadership.This raises fundamental questions:Where in the Qur’an does Allah command Muslims to haveImams,Sheikhs, orUstaadhs?What are the qualifications of such figures according to Qur’anic verses?If such offices are not mentioned, how did they become integral to Islamic practice?These questions are not intended to offend but to provoke honest scholarly reflection on the historical and theological authenticity of Islamic leadership structures.2. The Qur’anic Silence on Religious HierarchyMuslims sometimes citeSurah al-Baqarah 2:124, which reads:“And [mention] when Abraham was tried by his Lord with commands and he fulfilled them. [Allah] said, ‘Indeed, I will make you a leader (Imām) for the people.’ [Abraham] said, ‘And of my descendants?’ [Allah] said, ‘My covenant does not include the wrongdoers.’” (Qur’an 2:124)However, a linguistic and contextual analysis reveals that the Arabic termImāmhere does not refer to a religious cleric or teacher as in modern Islam. It simply denotes aleaderormodel— in this case, Abraham as the father of nations (see Ibn Kathir,Tafsir al-Qur’an al-‘Azim, vol. 1). The verse does not establish an institutional office or a perpetual title ofImamwithin a religious system.Beyond this verse, the Qur’an providesno direct command or descriptionfor an office ofImam,Sheikh, orUstaadhwith qualifications, responsibilities, or ordination processes. These titles evolved later through Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) and cultural development, particularly under the Abbasid and Ottoman caliphates (see Hodgson,The Venture of Islam, 1974).Thus, the modern Islamic clerical system lacks divine establishment within the Qur’anic revelation itself.3. The Biblical Model of Church LeadershipIn contrast, theBible provides an explicit, divinely inspired frameworkfor spiritual leadership in the Church of Christ. Scripture identifies and qualifies distinct offices for governance and teaching within the body of believers.3.1 Christ as the Head of the ChurchThe New Testament declares that Jesus Christ Himself is the sole and eternal head of the Church:“And He put all things under His feet and gave Him as head over all things to the church.” (Ephesians 1:22; cf. 4:15; Colossians 1:18)This means that all authority and leadership flow directly from Christ, not from man-made offices or traditions.3.2 Autonomy and Governance of the ChurchThe Apostle Paul instructed Titus to establish elders in every city:“For this reason I left you in Crete, that you should set in order the things that are lacking, and appoint elders in every city as I commanded you.” (Titus 1:5)This demonstrates that biblical leadership was divinely directed, spiritually qualified, and locally accountable—unlike Islamic leadership, which developed administratively rather than through divine revelation.4. Offices of the Church According to Scripture4.1 Bishops and Pastors (Overseers)The qualifications of bishops (or overseers) are clearly set forth in 1 Timothy 3:1–7:“If anyone desires the office of a bishop, he desires a good work. A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, temperate, sober-minded, of good behavior, hospitable, able to teach; not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for money, but gentle, not quarrelsome, not covetous…”This passage reveals divine standards for leadership based on moral integrity, family responsibility, and spiritual maturity.4.2 DeaconsLikewise, Scripture outlines the role of deacons in 1 Timothy 3:8–13:“Deacons likewise must be dignified, not double-tongued, not addicted to much wine, not greedy for dishonest gain. They must hold the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience.”This structure ensures order, accountability, and sanctity in the service of God’s people.4.3 Further Biblical WitnessOther scriptural affirmations of church order include:Titus 1:1–9– Qualifications of elders.Acts 6:1–6– Appointment of the first deacons.Philippians 1:1– Recognition of bishops and deacons within the early Church.5. Comparative Theological AnalysisThe fundamental difference between Christianity and Islam in matters of leadership lies indivine revelation versus human construction.InChristianity, leadership offices are divinely instituted through apostolic authority and Scriptural revelation.InIslam, religious offices such asImam,Sheikh, andUstaadhare not divinely ordained but historically constructed to fill interpretative and administrative gaps after Muhammad’s death.Without Qur’anic basis for such roles, the legitimacy of the Islamic clerical system is theologically questionable. The Bible, on the other hand, remains internally consistent and self-authenticating concerning its leadership framework.6. Conclusion: An Invitation to TruthDear readers, the absence of Qur’anic directives concerning Islamic clerical offices exposes the constructed nature of Islamic authority. Conversely, the Bible provides an unbroken, Spirit-guided structure for leadership within the Body of Christ.Therefore, I invite my Muslim friends to examine the Scriptures openly and consider the truth of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, who alone is the Shepherd and Savior of humanity (John 10:11; Acts 4:12).Islam may have titles and traditions, but Christianity hasdivine revelation and salvation through Christ alone.“And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.” —John 8:32BibliographyThe Holy Bible, English Standard Version (ESV).The Qur’an, Translation by Abdullah Yusuf Ali.Ibn Kathir,Tafsir al-Qur’an al-‘Azim, Vol. 1.

    "full_content": "ALLAH REVEALS SORCERY AND FORCES MUSLIMS TO PRACTICE ITBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteOriginally written on August 8, 2015 – Academic English Edition (2025)AbstractThis article critically examines the Qur’ānic claim regarding the origin and practice of sorcery (uchawi) within Islam, as recorded inSurat Ṭā Hā 20:73. The Qur’an itself suggests that Allah not only revealed sorcery but also compelled its practice. This study analyzes the implications of such a theological assertion and contrasts it with the biblical worldview, where sorcery is condemned as rebellion against God. The discussion also engages with Islamic tafsīr (commentary) sources and raises theological and moral questions concerning the nature of divine holiness and the ethical character of Allah as presented in the Qur’an.IntroductionThroughout history, scholars and theologians have debated the origins of magic and sorcery. Within the Judeo-Christian tradition, sorcery is consistently condemned as a form of rebellion against the Creator (cf.Deuteronomy 18:10–12). However, the Qur’an presents a distinctive narrative that attributes the revelation of sorcery to Allah Himself. This raises profound theological and moral questions about divine nature and the Islamic understanding of good and evil.The focus of this study isSurat Ṭā Hā 20:73, a verse which states that Allah compelled people to perform sorcery. The implications of this statement suggest divine involvement in acts that the Bible categorically condemns.Qur’ānic EvidenceSurat Ṭā Hā 20:73 (Translation by Sheikh Ali Muhsin Al-Barwani):“Indeed, we have believed in our Lord that He may forgive us our sins and the magic which you compelled us to perform. And Allah is better and more enduring.”This verse reveals that Allah forced individuals to learn and practice magic. Sheikh Ali Muhsin Al-Barwani’s tafsīr (Swahili translation and commentary) clarifies this as:“We have believed in our true Lord so that He may forgive our past sins and the sorcery which we were compelled to learn and practice. And our Lord’s reward is greater and everlasting.”Thus, two critical points emerge:Muslims werecompelled to learn sorcery.Muslims werecompelled to practice sorcery.If Allah truly compelled His followers to perform sorcery, it invites a theological crisis:Since when does God act as a sorcerer or require His followers to engage in magic?What benefit could divine-revealed witchcraft bring to humanity or to the moral order of creation?Theological ImplicationsThe idea that Allah “revealed” or “forced” sorcery contradicts the moral nature of divine holiness as understood in biblical theology. In Scripture, witchcraft is consistently categorized as an abomination before God. The Apostle Paul condemns it among the “works of the flesh” (cf.Galatians 5:20), and the prophet Samuel equates it with rebellion:“For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry.”—1 Samuel 15:23 (KJV)If the Qur’an attributes the origin and practice of magic to Allah, then it presents a deity who is morally inconsistent with the biblical concept of holiness, justice, and goodness. This raises an essential theological question for Muslims:Can a God who sanctions witchcraft be the same as the Holy God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob?Prophet Muhammad and the Use of MagicIslamic Hadith literature further complicates the issue. According toSunan Ibn Mājah, Vol. 5, Hadith No. 3525 (p. 48), Muhammad himself practiced forms of magical protection (ndumba) against the evil eye and poisonous creatures:“The Prophet used incantations and charms against the evil eye and venomous creatures.” (Sunan Ibn Mājah, Book 31, Hadith 3525)This practice raises ethical and theological questions:Why would a prophet of God rely on magic (ndumba) instead of divine power?Does Allah lack the ability to heal or protect without the use of occult means?In contrast, biblical prophets never resorted to witchcraft or magical arts. Their authority came directly from the Spirit of God, not from charms or incantations.Biblical Position on SorceryThe Bible firmly prohibits witchcraft in all its forms. God warns His people:“There shall not be found among you anyone who practices divination or sorcery, interprets omens, engages in witchcraft, or casts spells.”—Deuteronomy 18:10–12Furthermore, Scripture declares the ultimate judgment of sorcerers:“But the cowardly, unbelieving, vile, murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts... their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death.”—Revelation 21:8 (NIV)Hence, any divine endorsement or revelation of sorcery is incompatible with biblical theology. The God of the Bible is holy and cannot participate in or endorse evil.ConclusionThe Qur’anic assertion that Allah revealed and compelled the practice of sorcery introduces profound moral and theological contradictions. A holy God cannot be the source or promoter of witchcraft. Islam’s acceptance of such narratives undermines the moral purity and transcendence that define divine nature.Christianity, by contrast, affirms a God of holiness who forbids sorcery and delivers humanity from its bondage through Jesus Christ. The invitation remains:“Accept the living Jesus Christ and receive eternal life. Religion cannot save you; only a relationship with the true God through Christ can.”ReferencesThe Qur’an,Surat Ṭā Hā 20:73– Translated and Commented by Sheikh Ali Muhsin Al-Barwani (Dar es Salaam: Al-Barwani Publications).Ibn Mājah, Sunan Ibn Mājah, Vol. 5, Hadith No. 3525 (Book of Medicine).The Holy Bible, King James Version (KJV),1 Samuel 15:23; Deuteronomy 18:10–12; Revelation 21:8; Galatians 5:20.Al-Tabari, Tafsir al-Tabari, commentary onSurat Ṭā Hā 20:73.Dr. Maxwell Shimba,Shimba Theological Institute Journal of Biblical Apologetics, Vol. 2 (2015).© 2015–2025 Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAll rights reserved.

    "full_content": "Jesus is God According to the Qur’an (Part Two)By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute(Originally written on August 8, 2015)AbstractThis study investigates whether Jesus Christ (ʿĪsā in Arabic) possesses divine attributes as affirmed in the Qur’an. The analysis compares the Qur’anic attributes of Allah with the biblical description of Jesus Christ to determine theological parallels, specifically focusing on the attributeAl-Wārith(“The Heir” or “The Inheritor of All Things”). Through scriptural comparison, it is demonstrated that the Qur’an, though written over six centuries after Christ, indirectly affirms Jesus’ divine nature by attributing to Him a title that is one of the exclusive Names of Allah.1. IntroductionThe Qur’an attributes to Allah several divine names known asAsma’ al-Husna(the 99 Beautiful Names of God). Among these isAl-Wārith(ٱلْوَارِثُ), meaning“The Inheritor of All Things.”This divine quality signifies that God is the ultimate possessor and heir of the heavens and the earth.This paper examines whether the same attribute is also found in reference to Jesus Christ in the Bible, and if so, what theological implications arise when both texts—Qur’an and Bible—affirm the same divine characteristic.2. The Qur’anic Witness: Allah as Al-WārithThe Qur’an affirms this attribute inSurah Maryam (19:40):“Indeed, We will inherit the earth and whoever is on it, and to Us they will be returned.”(Qur’an, Surah Maryam 19:40, Sahih International Translation)In this verse, Allah declares Himself as theheir(Al-Wārith) of the entire world and all within it. According to Islamic theology, this attribute emphasizes Allah’s eternal sovereignty and ownership over creation.However, the Qur’an was revealed approximately632 A.D., over six centuries after Jesus’ earthly ministry. The concept of divine inheritance was already established in Christian Scripture, specifically in the New Testament, long before the Qur’an was written.3. The Biblical Witness: Jesus as the Heir of All ThingsTheEpistle to the Hebrewsexplicitly attributes the same divine title to Jesus Christ:“But in these last days He has spoken to us by His Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, and through whom He also made the universe.”(Hebrews 1:2, NIV)Here, Jesus Christ is not only declared as theHeir of all things—a title equivalent toAl-Wārith—but also as the divine agent through whom the universe was created. This dual claim identifies Him both as Creator and as the eternal Inheritor of all creation, roles reserved for God alone.Therefore, by comparing these two sources, one observes that the Bible ascribes to Jesus the same eternal attribute that the Qur’an ascribes to Allah. This shared title signifies divine continuity, not contradiction.4. Theological AnalysisThe chronological sequence is vital for theological inquiry. Since theBible predates the Qur’an by over six centuries, any divine attribute later echoed in the Qur’an must be understood as derivative rather than original within Islamic revelation.Historical methodology dictates that earlier data holds greater evidentiary weight. The biblical record, existing long before the Qur’an, establishes Jesus as “Heir of all things.” Thus, when the Qur’an later affirms that Allah is “the Inheritor of all things,” it inadvertently validates the prior biblical declaration thatJesus is the divine heir.Consequently, one must conclude that the Qur’an—perhaps unintentionally—acknowledges the divinity of Christ by confirming His possession of a title belonging exclusively to God.5. ConclusionThe investigation clearly reveals that Jesus Christ possesses the divine attribute ofAl-Wārith—“The Heir of All Things.” This title, first revealed in the Bible (Hebrews 1:2), was later reiterated in the Qur’an (Surah Maryam 19:40) as a divine attribute of Allah.Therefore, by its own theological admission, the Qur’an affirms a core truth of Christian theology:Jesus Christ shares in the divine essence of God. This realization invites the reader to consider which revelation—the earlier and consistent witness of Scripture or the later derivative text—provides the authoritative declaration of divine truth.BibliographyThe Holy Bible, New International Version (NIV).

Does this attribute of Al-Malik al-Mulk also apply to the living Jesus?Let us begin our research by reading the Quran and seeing for ourselves whether Jesus is truly God or not. One of the attributes or majesty of God according to the Quran is: Al-Malik al-Mulk, meaning THE OWNER OF EVERYTHING. This attribute of Al-Malik al-Mulk is one of the 99 names of Allah in the Quran.Does Jesus have this attribute of OWNER OF ALL \"Al-Malik al-Mulk\"? Let us first read the Quran and see if Allah has this attribute of Al-Malik al-Mulk.Surah YA-SIN 83:\"So exalted is He in whose hand is the realm of all things; and to Him you will be returned.\"Allah says that He is the Owner of everything in the Quran, which was written 632 years after Jesus. Does Jesus have this attribute of Owner of all things?JESUS SAYS THIS:Matthew 11:27 “All things have been committed to me by my Father; no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.”This means that Jesus was the first to confess these words, that He is the owner of all things, according to the testimony of the Bible, which preceded the Quran by 632 years. JESUS SAYS THAT \"ALL THINGS HAVE BEEN COMMITTED TO ME.\" This means that even Muhammad is now under Jesus.JESUS CONTINUES TO SAYin John 16:15,“All that belongs to the Father is mine. That is why I said the Spirit will receive from me what he will make known to you.”Jesus says that everything that belongs to His Father is His. At this point, the matter is settled, as no one can dispute this clear and complete verse. JESUS IS THE OWNER OF EVERYTHING.So, between Jesus, who spoke these words 632 years before Allah, and Allah, who came later with the Quran full of doubts, whom shall we believe? The first, who is Jesus, or Allah, who is just copying from Jesus?Dear friends, this is sufficient evidence that Jesus is God, for today we have learned that Jesus said and is called the OWNER OF ALL THINGS 632 years before the writing of the Quran.Now, between the Bible, which came before the Quran, and the Quran, which came after the Bible, which book will you follow? Researchers in various fields use original data to verify and confirm a matter. And the data we have about the OWNER of all things, which is the earliest, is in the Bible and says that the OWNER OF ALL THINGS IS JESUS.Today, I have answered the question of Muslims: Is Jesus God? The Quran, together with Allah, says that Jesus is God because Jesus has all the majesty and/or attributes of God, and one of those attributes is AL-MALIK AL-MULK.In His service,Dr. Maxwell ShimbaCopyright © Max Shimba Ministries 2015",

    "full_content": "THE QUR’AN IS NOT THE WORD OF ALLAH NOR OF GODBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteDate:Thursday, August 6, 2015IntroductionThis is one of the most critical theological questions that should challenge every Muslim to examine the origin, structure, and nature of the Qur’an. Muslims worldwide commonly assert that“the Qur’an is the pure word of Allah.”However, when one examines the Qur’an critically and contextually, a profound contradiction emerges. Many voices other than Allah are found speaking within the Qur’an itself. This raises a series of important theological questions:If Allah is the sole author of the Qur’an, why do we hear other entities — such as Satan, Mary, the angels, and prophets — speaking directly in the text?Why does Allah require the help ofJibril(Gabriel) to deliver His message if He is omnipotent and omnipresent?Can the Qur’an still be called “the Word of Allah” when it contains the words of multiple beings?Let us now explore the internal evidence from the Qur’an itself.1. Satan Speaks in the Qur’anSurah Al-Hijr 15:39:“[Iblis] said: My Lord! Because You have put me in the wrong, I will make [evil] fair-seeming to them on the earth, and I will mislead them all.”Here, we clearly see Satan speaking in the Qur’an. The verse does not record Allah’s words, but the direct speech of Satan. Therefore, this statement cannot be considered divine revelation from Allah’s mouth.Question:If Allah alone speaks in the Qur’an, how is it that Satan’s direct words are recorded within the same text? Does this mean the Qur’an is partially composed of Satan’s speech?2. Prophet Zakaria Speaks in the Qur’anSurah Maryam 19:4:“He (Zakaria) said: My Lord! Indeed my bones have weakened, and my head has filled with white, but never have I been disappointed in my supplication to You, my Lord.”Here, Prophet Zakaria is speaking. His personal prayer is being quoted directly. This indicates that the Qur’an contains not only the words of Allah but also the prayers and dialogues of human beings.Question:If the Qur’an is purely Allah’s word, why does it include the personal expressions and emotions of a prophet?3. Mary (Maryam) Speaks in the Qur’anSurah Maryam 19:18:“She (Mary) said: Indeed, I seek refuge in the Most Merciful from you, if you should be fearing of Allah.”Mary, the mother of Jesus (Isa), is here shown speaking in her own voice. Are we to assume that Mary’s speech is Allah’s word?Question:Has Mary become divine by virtue of her words being included in the Qur’an? If not, then whose word is this truly?4. The Angels Speak in the Qur’anSurah Maryam 19:21:“He (the angel) said: Thus [it will be]; your Lord says, ‘It is easy for Me, and We will make him a sign to the people and a mercy from Us. And it is a matter already decreed.’”Here again, the speaker is not Allah but an angel—identified in Islamic tradition as Jibril (Gabriel). This demonstrates that even the angel’s words are recorded as part of the Qur’an.Question:If Allah’s word is perfect and self-sufficient, why must it include the words of His creation?5. Jesus (Isa) Speaks in the Qur’anSurah Maryam 19:36:“And indeed, Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. That is a straight path.”Here, Jesus himself is speaking. This verse records Jesus’ direct declaration. If this is “the word of Allah,” then Allah is quoting Isa verbatim — meaning that Isa’s words are embedded within Allah’s alleged word.Question:Does this not demonstrate that the Qur’an contains the voices of men, angels, and even Satan — rather than the exclusive speech of Allah?6. Other Human Speakers in the Qur’anThe Qur’an also records the words of Pharaoh (Surah Ash-Shu‘ara 26:29), Abraham (Surah Al-An‘am 6:79), Noah (Surah Hud 11:37), and the people of various nations. This mixture of divine narration and creaturely dialogue makes it impossible to claim the Qur’an is entirely the speech of Allah.For example:Surah Al-A‘raf 7:12:“[Allah] said: What prevented you (O Iblis) from prostrating when I commanded you?” [Iblis] said: I am better than him. You created me from fire and created him from clay.”Here we again have Allah and Satan conversing — a dialogue involving multiple speakers.The Problem of Mediation: Why Does Allah Need Jibril?Muslims claim that Allah isAll-PowerfulandAll-Knowing. Yet, according to Islamic theology, Allah never spoke directly to Muhammad; instead, He sent Jibril (Gabriel) as a messenger to deliver His revelation (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:97).Critical Question:If Allah is omnipresent and omnipotent, why did He need a helper (Jibril) to convey His message? Could Allah not communicate directly, as He allegedly spoke directly to Moses in the Torah (Surah An-Nisa 4:164)?This theological inconsistency raises doubts about the divine origin of the Qur’an and the necessity of intermediaries in delivering revelation.7. A Mixture of VoicesThe Qur’an contains conversations between:Allah and angelsAllah and prophetsProphets and their peopleSatan and AllahHuman beings among themselvesThis multiplicity of speakers makes the Qur’an a compilation of dialogues, not a single monologue from Allah. In literary analysis, such a composition is calledpolyphonic— having many voices. Therefore, it cannot logically or theologically be described as the “pure word of Allah.”Conclusion and ChallengeTherefore, the central question remains:Who is the real speaker in the Qur’an?Is the Qur’an truly the Word of Allah, or is it a collection of multiple voices?If Allah needs Jibril to speak, does that not suggest limitation rather than omnipotence?Why does the Qur’an contain the words of Satan, humans, and angels?Until Muslims can answer these questionsacademically and scripturally, the claim that “the Qur’an is the direct word of Allah” remains theologically inconsistent.We invite our Muslim brothers and sisters to examine this matter sincerely and to seek the truth found inJesus Christ, the Living Word of God(John 1:1; John 14:6).ReferencesThe Qur’an:Surah Al-Hijr 15:39; Surah Maryam 19:4, 18, 21, 36; Surah Ash-Shu‘ara 26:29; Surah Al-A‘raf 7:12; Surah Al-Baqarah 2:97; Surah An-Nisa 4:164.The Bible:John 1:1 – “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.”John 14:6– “Jesus said, I am the way, the truth, and the life.”Academic Source:W.

    "full_content": "Monday, August 3, 2015Who Is the Creator, Allah or Jehovah?By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAll adherents of religion generally believe that God is the Creator of humanity, animals, and everything visible and invisible. But it is important to examine critically what Jehovah (Yahweh) says about creation and compare it with what Allah says in the Qur’an. Do their statements align, or do they differ?1. The Image of HumanityAllah declares in the Qur’an:“Say, He is Allah, [who is] One, Allah, the Eternal Refuge. He neither begets nor is born, Nor is there to Him any equivalent.”(Qur’an 112:1–4,Surah Al-Ikhlas)According to this verse, Allah emphasizes that He neither begets nor is born and that no one resembles Him.In contrast, the Bible says:“Then God said, ‘Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.’ So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.”(Genesis 1:26–27, NIV)Here we observe a key difference: Jehovah (Yahweh) created humanity in His image, whereas Allah asserts that no one resembles Him.Questions for Reflection:Does this suggest that Allah and Jehovah are the same entity?If humans are made in the image of God (Genesis 1:26–27), in what way does God resemble us? (See also Genesis 5:1–2; 9:6; 1 Corinthians 11:7; Colossians 1:15; 3:10; Acts 17:28–29; James 3:9)Given that God is Spirit (John 4:24), how can humans reflect His image spiritually and morally?2. Oaths and the Creator’s AuthorityThe Qur’an also records Allah swearing by His creation:“By the sun and its brightness, and by the moon when it follows it, and by the day when it displays it, and by the night when it conceals it, and by the heavens and Him Who built them, and by the earth and Him Who spread it, and by the soul and Him Who proportioned it.”(Qur’an 91:1–7,Surah Ash-Shams)“By the night when it covers, and by the day when it shines, and by He who created male and female.”(Qur’an 92:1–3,Surah Al-Layl)Here Allah swears by the heavens, the earth, and the Creator of both. But who is this “Builder of the heavens and Expander of the earth”?Further verses assert:“And Allah has created the heavens and the earth in truth…”(Qur’an 45:22,Surah Al-Jathiyah)“The Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is within them; if you are certain [of faith] then believe in Him alone.”(Qur’an 44:7–8,Surah Ad-Dukhan)In comparison, Jehovah declares:“Thus says the LORD, your Redeemer, who formed you in the womb: I am the LORD, who makes all things, who stretches out the heavens alone, who spreads out the earth—who was with me?”(Isaiah 44:24, ESV)And:“I have sworn by myself, the word has gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return: ‘Before me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.’”(Isaiah 45:22–23, ESV)Notice that Jehovah swears by His own self, not by His creation, unlike Allah, who swears by the heavens and the earth.3. Key Observations and Debate Questions:Jehovah asserts His sovereignty as the sole Creator and swears by His own being. Allah swears by His creation. What theological implications arise from swearing by created things versus swearing by the Creator Himself?If Allah is truly the Creator, why does the Qur’an not specify what was created on thefirst day? (See Qur’an 41:9–12 for creation sequences—still debated)Are Allah and Jehovah the same being if their statements about creation, humanity, and oaths differ?Why does the Qur’an emphasize that Allah has no equal, yet humans are created without His image, whereas Jehovah explicitly created humans in His image?Who truly is the Creator of all things—Allah as described in the Qur’an, or Jehovah as depicted in the Bible?This reflection invites deeper study and comparative theological discussion. Scholars, students, and followers are encouraged to examine scripture critically and question apparent contradictions.References:The Holy Bible, New International Version (NIV)Qur’an, Translations by Saheeh InternationalJohn 4:24, Genesis 1:26–27, Genesis 2:7, Genesis 5:1–2, Genesis 9:61 Corinthians 11:7, Colossians 1:15, Colossians 3:10, Acts 17:28–29, James 3:9Isaiah 44:24; 45:6–7, 22–23; 14:24; Jeremiah 27:5Hebrews 12:9, Ezekiel 18:4, Numbers 16:22Maxwell Shimba Ministries Org ©2015.

Is having a FACE not a characteristic of human beings?Allah says:“كُلُّ شَيْءٍ هَالِكٌ إِلَّا وَجْهَهُ”(Everything will perish except His FACE (Allah).) Surah 28, Ayah 88.My brothers, Allah continues admitting that He has a FACE like created beings.Continue reading:ALLAH ADMITS THAT HIS FACE HAS EYES“At one time the EYES of Allah were hurting, and the Angels went to see Him, and it is said that Allah shed Tears because of the Flood of Prophet Noah until His eyes became red.”(Al-Milal wannihal, Vol. 1 p. 141)I know Muslims will deny that this hadith isda’if(weak) and that it is not in the Qur’an. Let us continue reading another evidence that Allah has two eyes and that the wordKafiris written between His eyes.The hadith of Anas (r.a): He said, the Prophet (s.a.w) said:“There has been no Prophet sent except that he warned his people about the one-eyed liar. Know that he has one eye, and indeed your Lord is not one-eyed—between His eyes is written the word ‘KAFIR.’”(Bukhari, Hadith No. 245, Volume 9)ALLAH ADMITS THAT HE HAS EARS AND EYESSurah An-Nisa 58:“Indeed Allah commands you to return trusts to whom they belong, and when you judge between people, judge with justice. Indeed, the things Allah advises you are very good. Indeed, Allah is the One who HEARS and the One who SEES.”Muslims, I know this is a thorn in your hearts.Dear readers, you have already understood that Allah is a created being like humans, and He has a FACE with EYES and EARS.May God bless you greatly.In His Service,Max Shimba Ministries Org.MAX SHIMBA MINISTRIES ORG ©2015.

Allah created you with His own hands… but because of your sin, you caused mankind to be expelled from Paradise.’Adam replied: ‘O Moses, Allah indeed honored you and wrote the Torah for you with His own hands.’”In another hadith narrated from Abu Huraira, we read:“Allah descends to the lowest heaven and stretches out His two hands and says…”Then, the narrator supports his claim with the following Qur’anic verses:وَقَالَتِ الْيَهُودُ يَدُ اللَّهِ مَغْلُولَةٌ... بَلْ يَدَاهُ مَبْسُوطَتَانِ يُنْفِقُ كَيْفَ يَشَاءُ ۚ“The Jews say, ‘The hand of Allah is tied up.’ Their hands are tied up, and they are cursed for what they say. Rather, both His hands are outstretched; He spends however He wills…”(Al-Maida 5:64)فَسُبْحَانَ الَّذِي بِيَدِهِ مَلَكُوتُ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ“So exalted is He in whose hand is the realm of all things, and to Him you will be returned.”(Yasin 36:83)قُلِ اللَّهُمَّ مَالِكَ الْمُلْكِ... بِيَدِكَ الْخَيْرُ إِنَّكَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ“Say, O Allah, Owner of Sovereignty, You give sovereignty to whom You will and take sovereignty away from whom You will. You honor whom You will and humble whom You will. In Your hand is all good. Indeed, You are over all things competent.”(Aali Imran 3:26)Muhammad bin MuslimaskedImam Muhammad al-Baqir (a.s.)about the following verse:قَالَ يَا إِبْلِيسُ مَا مَنَعَكَ أَنْ تَسْجُدَ لِمَا خَلَقْتُ بِيَدَيَّ“(Allah) said, ‘O Iblis, what prevented you from prostrating to that which I created with My hands?’”(Saad 38:75)A Question to MuslimsWhy do you say that Allah has no likeness, while He Himself has revealed that He hashands? Are not hands a form similar to those of human beings? Why do you then falsely claim that Allah has no hands?The Hands of AllahWe believe that Allah indeed has two noble hands. He says:بَلْ يَدَاهُ مَبْسُوطَتَانِ يُنفِقُ كَيْفَ يَشَاءُ“Rather, both His hands are outstretched; He spends however He wills.”(Al-Maida 5:64)And He also says:وَمَا قَدَرُوا اللَّهَ حَقَّ قَدْرِهِ... وَالسَّمَاوَاتُ مَطْوِيَّاتٌ بِيَمِينِهِ...“And they did not appraise Allah with true appraisal, while the earth will be within His grip on the Day of Resurrection, and the heavens will be folded in His right hand…”(Az-Zumar 39:67)When Muslims pledged allegiance to the Prophet of Allah (peace be upon him) under the tree during the Day of Ridhwan, Allah revealed:إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يُبَايِعُونَكَ إِنَّمَا يُبَايِعُونَ اللَّهَ يَدُ اللَّهِ فَوْقَ أَيْدِيهِمْ“Indeed, those who pledge allegiance to you are actually pledging allegiance to Allah. The hand of Allah is over their hands.”(Al-Fath 48:10)It should be understood that when Allah says He has hands or eyes, it does not mean His hands are like ours or His eyes like ours—Astaghfirullah (God forbid).A table has legs, and chairs also have legs, but the legs of a chair or table differ from the legs of the human who made them. The attributes of the creator must differ from the attributes of the created. Similarly, Allah’s attributes cannot be compared to ours. However, we must still acknowledge everything that Allah ascribed to Himself.The Eyes of AllahWe also believe that Allah truly has two eyes, as proven in His words toNoah (peace be upon him):وَاصْنَعِ الْفُلْكَ بِأَعْيُنِنَا وَوَحْيِنَا“And construct the ship under Our eyes and Our inspiration.”(Hud 11:37)The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said:“His veil is light, and if He were to remove it, the radiance of His face would burn everything that His gaze reaches.”And regarding the Antichrist (Dajjal), he said:“The Dajjal is one-eyed, but your Lord is not one-eyed.”We believe that our human eyes cannot see Allah, as the Qur’an says:لَا تُدْرِكُهُ الْأَبْصَارُ وَهُوَ يُدْرِكُ الْأَبْصَارَ وَهُوَ اللَّطِيفُ الْخَبِيرُ“Vision perceives Him not, but He perceives [all] vision; and He is the Subtle, the Acquainted.”(Al-An’am 6:103)Dear readers, you can now see clearly that Allah is portrayed as a being similar to humans, because He is described as havinghandsandeyes.May God bless you.In His service,Dr. Max ShimbaMax Shimba Ministries Org.© 2015 Max Shimba Ministries.

    "full_content": "ALLAH WEARS GARMENTS LIKE CREATURES: AN ANTHROPOMORPHIC CRISIS IN ISLAMIC THEOLOGYBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteOriginally published on August 3, 2015AbstractThis study critically examines the anthropomorphic depictions of Allah found in Islamic Hadith literature. By analyzing authentic Hadith texts and their theological implications, this paper argues that the Islamic conception of Allah—though officially described as transcendent and incomparable—reveals inconsistencies through narratives that portray Him in human-like forms and actions. These portrayals present a theological crisis within Islam’s doctrine oftanzīh(absolute transcendence) and challenge the Muslim claim that Allah has no likeness (laysa kamithlihi shayʾun).1. IntroductionOne of the fundamental claims of Islamic theology is that Allah is beyond all human likeness or form. The Qur’an emphatically declares:“There is nothing whatever like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.” (Qur’an 42:11).However, a careful examination of the Hadith—the recorded sayings of Muhammad—reveals that Allah is often described in distinctly human terms. Such descriptions introduce theological contradictions that undermine the doctrine of divine transcendence.This paper explores these contradictions, particularly focusing on Hadith Qudsi that depict Allah aswearing garments—a characteristic belonging to physical beings.2. The Hadith of Allah’s GarmentsInSahih Muslim(Book 38, Hadith 7388), Allah is reported to have said:الكبرياء ردائي والعظمة إزاري“Pride is My cloak and majesty is My lower garment.”This statement is widely quoted in Islamic theology as a Hadith Qudsi—words of Allah relayed through Muhammad. However, this anthropomorphic imagery raises profound theological questions.If Allah possesses a cloak (ridāʾ) and a lower garment (izār), it implies He has aformupon which these garments are worn. In the material world, garments are designed tocoveroradorna body. Thus, if Allah “wears” them, one must logically infer that He hasa body or structure—a notion directly conflicting with the Qur’anic claim that He is without likeness or form.This apparent contradiction leads to the central problem ofanthropomorphismin Islamic thought.3. Anthropomorphic Imagery in Other HadithThe anthropomorphism is not limited to Allah’s garments. In another Hadith Qudsi found inSahih al-Bukhari(Book 81, Hadith 38), Allah is portrayed as having human faculties:“When I love My servant, I become his hearing with which he hears, his sight with which he sees, his hand with which he strikes, and his foot with which he walks.”The language of this Hadith implies that Allah hasears, eyes, hands, and feet, or at least attributes them to Himself in human-like metaphors.Islamic theologians such asIbn TaymiyyahandIbn al-Qayyimaccepted these versesbi-la kayf(“without asking how”), meaning they affirmed Allah’s attributes without questioning their modality. However, this approach fails to reconcile the logical inconsistency betweentranscendence (tanzīh)andembodiment (tashbīh).4. Theological ImplicationsThe problem of anthropomorphism in Islamic theology stems from its tension between two competing ideas:Transcendence (Tanzīh):Allah is utterly beyond human comprehension or likeness.Similarity (Tashbīh):Allah’s revealed attributes resemble human characteristics.While the Qur’an insists on transcendence, the Hadith reintroduce physical and emotional traits—suggesting that Allah:Descends physically to the lowest heaven at night (Sahih Bukhari 1145).Laughs, smiles, and sits on a throne (Sahih Muslim 2841).Has fingers and a right hand (Sahih Bukhari 4855; Sahih Muslim 2788).Such imagery parallels pagan conceptions of deity and contradicts monotheistic doctrines of divine simplicity and incorporeality.5. Biblical Contrast: The God of ScriptureIn contrast, the God of the Bible, though described metaphorically, explicitly reveals Himself asSpirit(John 4:24). Biblical anthropomorphisms are understood assymbolic expressionsmeant to help finite humans comprehend divine realities.For example, when the Bible says “the hand of the Lord” (Exodus 15:6), it does not imply a literal hand but symbolizes God’s power and authority. Unlike the Hadith, biblical theology clearly distinguishes betweenfigurative languageandontological reality.6. ConclusionThe depiction of Allah as wearing garments, possessing limbs, and performing physical actions introduces a theological crisis within Islam. Such portrayals undermine the Qur’anic assertion that Allah has no equal or likeness.From a comparative theological standpoint, the Christian understanding of God asspiritual and personal—revealed fully in Jesus Christ (John 1:14)—provides a coherent and consistent framework for divine transcendence and immanence.The Islamic dilemma, as seen in the Hadith, reflects a form oftheological anthropomorphismthat inadvertently humanizes Allah, thereby compromising His alleged uniqueness.BibliographyAl-Bukhari, Muhammad ibn Isma‘il.Sahih al-Bukhari.

However, a careful comparative reading of its various surahs (chapters) reveals statements that appear contradictory, particularly concerning how Muslims are instructed to treat non-Muslims, especially the \"People of the Book\" (Christians and Jews). This article seeks to examine a series of Qur'anic verses and analyze the apparent inconsistencies in their directives, questioning the reliability of the text as a divine revelation.Textual AnalysisInSurah Al-Baqara (2:109), the Qur'an states:\"Many of the People of the Book wish, through envy, to lead you back to unbelief, now that you have embraced the faith and the truth has been made plain to them. Forgive them and bear with them until Allah makes known His will. He has power over all things.\"(Qur'an 2:109, Abdel Haleem Translation)This verse addresses Christians and Jews, referred to as \"People of the Book,\" suggesting that some of them envy Muslims and wish to turn them away from Islam. However, it counsels Muslims to forgive and be patient with them until Allah reveals His final judgment.Similarly, inSurah Al-Imran (3:20):\"If they turn away, your duty is only to convey the message.\"(Qur'an 3:20, Yusuf Ali Translation)This verse instructs Muslims to merely warn non-believers, indicating that it is not the responsibility of Muslims to force others into belief.From these two verses, one can deduce:It is the duty of Muslims to preach their religion but not to compel people to believe.Allah, in His own time, will reveal His will to those who disbelieve.Muslims are only responsible for conveying warnings to non-believers.However, other Qur'anic verses present a starkly different message:InSurah An-Nisa (4:101):\"The disbelievers are your sworn enemies.\"(Qur'an 4:101, Pickthall Translation)InSurah At-Tawba (9:3):\"Announce to those who disbelieve a painful punishment.\"(Qur'an 9:3, Sahih International Translation)InSurah Al-Anfal (8:39):\"Fight them until there is no [more] persecution, and religion is for Allah [alone].\"(Qur'an 8:39, Sahih International Translation)These verses appear to transition from patient tolerance to active hostility, including the declaration of enmity, threats of severe punishment, and commands for armed conflict until Islam reigns supreme.Critical QuestionsThis textual divergence raises several crucial theological and logical questions:Was it the same entity who gave Muhammad the words in 2:109, 3:20, and those in 4:101, 9:3, and 8:39 — or were there multiple sources?Why would one verse command tolerance and mere warning, while another instructs hostility and warfare?Is this not indicative of forgetfulness — a human trait — which should not be attributed to an omniscient and omnipotent God?If it is indeed the same deity, are these verses compatible or contradictory?If they are compatible, how can such opposing commands be reconciled logically and theologically?If they contradict one another, does this not serve as evidence that the Qur'an is not from the true God, especially since the Qur'an itself establishes consistency as a criterion for divine authenticity?(cf. Qur'an 4:82: \"Do they not then consider the Qur'an carefully? Had it been from other than Allah, they would surely have found therein much contradiction.\")An infallible God cannot issue conflicting instructions, forget His prior declarations, or contradict Himself. Contradictions are a characteristic of human imperfection, not divine revelation.ConclusionThese apparent contradictions within the Qur'an pose a significant theological problem. The God of the Bible, by contrast, is consistent in character and purpose. He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, into the world to offer redemption for humanity’s sins, not through coercion but through love, grace, and truth.Therefore, I warmly invite Muslims to turn to the God of the Bible, who alone offers eternal salvation through Jesus Christ.May God bless you abundantly.ReferencesAbdel Haleem, M.

By examining select Qur'anic verses and Hadith narrations, and juxtaposing them with Islamic theological positions, this study seeks to critically analyze whether the anthropomorphic descriptions in Islamic texts imply a corporeal deity.Qur'anic Passages Referencing the Hands of AllahOne of the primary passages frequently cited is:Az-Zumar (39:67):\"They did not appraise Allah with true appraisal, while the earth entirely will be within His grip on the Day of Resurrection, and the heavens will be folded in His right hand. Exalted is He and high above what they associate with Him.\"Additionally,Al-Ma'idah (5:64)states:\"The Jews say, 'Allah's hand is chained.' Chained are their hands, and cursed are they for what they say. Rather, both His hands are extended; He spends however He wills.\"Other relevant verses include:Yasin (36:83):\"So exalted is He in whose hand is the realm of all things, and to Him you will be returned.\"Ali 'Imran (3:26):\"Say, 'O Allah, Owner of Sovereignty, You give sovereignty to whom You will and You take sovereignty away from whom You will. You honor whom You will and You humble whom You will. In Your hand is [all] good. Indeed, You are over all things competent.'\"Sad (38:75):\"[Allah] said, 'O Iblis, what prevented you from prostrating to that which I created with My hands? Are you arrogant, or are you among the exalted?'\"Hadith EvidenceAccording to narrations in Sunni compilations, Abu Huraira reported that the Prophet Muhammad said:\"Allah created Adam with His own hands and wrote the Torah for Moses with His own hands.\"Another hadith states:\"Allah descends to the nearest heaven and stretches out His two hands, saying…\"Theological CommentaryIslamic theologians from various schools—Ash'ari, Maturidi, Hanbali, and others—have engaged extensively with these anthropomorphic expressions. The traditional Sunni creed acknowledges Allah’s 'hands' and 'face' as mentioned in the Qur’an and Sunnah but asserts that these attributes are unique to Allah and bear no resemblance to human characteristics.A popular theological analogy explains: A table and a person both have 'legs,' but the nature of these legs differs. Similarly, Allah's 'hands' are befitting His majesty and beyond human comprehension.Additional Qur'anic Descriptions: Eyes of AllahThe Qur'an also references Allah's 'eyes':Hud (11:37):\"And construct the ship under Our eyes and Our revelation…\"Another hadith states:\"The Dajjal is one-eyed, and your Lord is not one-eyed.\"These descriptions, like those of Allah's 'hands,' are interpreted by theologians within the framework ofbilā kayf(without asking how) andtanzīh(declaring Allah's incomparability).Do These Attributes Imply Corporeality?Max Shimba Ministries contends that anthropomorphic language, if taken literally, challenges Islamic claims of Allah's absolute transcendence. If Allah possesses 'hands' and 'eyes' in any form comparable to creation, this could imply corporeality.ConclusionThis analysis reveals significant anthropomorphic language within the Qur’an and Hadith. Traditional Islamic theology resolves this tension through principles oftanzīhandbilā kayf, affirming the attributes without likening them to human attributes. However, literalist interpretations risk portraying Allah as a corporeal being, conflicting with Islamic assertions of divine incomparability.ReferencesThe Qur'an: Az-Zumar (39:67), Al-Ma'idah (5:64), Yasin (36:83), Ali 'Imran (3:26), Sad (38:75), Hud (11:37)Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim compilations of hadith via Abu HurairaAl-Ash'ari,Kitab al-Luma'(The Book of Flashes)Ibn Taymiyyah,Majmu' al-FatawaAl-Ghazali,Ihya Ulum al-DinAbout the AuthorDr. Maxwell Shimba is the founder of Max Shimba Ministries Org., a theologian and religious commentator focusing on comparative religion, biblical theology, and critical Islamic studies.© 2015 Max Shimba Ministries Org.

    "full_content": "Allah Wears Clothes Like His Creatures: A Theological InquiryBy Max Shimba Ministries Org.Monday, August 3, 2015IntroductionDear brethren,This matter presents yet another theological dilemma concerning the Islamic concept of Allah. The Allah of Islam, who has claimed in various Qur'anic verses that He has no likeness and cannot be compared to anything in existence, surprisingly contradicts Himself in certain hadith literature by implying that He wears garments, possesses physical attributes such as hands, eyes, and ears — essentially, attributes analogous to His creation.In this paper, we shall examine this issue critically, drawing upon authoritative Islamic sources to demonstrate how such descriptions contradict the fundamental Islamic claim of Allah’s absolute incomparability (tanzīh) and transcendence.Textual Evidence from Islamic SourcesLet us proceed directly to the evidences drawn from the hadith collections revered in Islam:1. Allah Wears ClothesIn an authentic Hadith Qudsi, Allah is quoted as saying:\"Al-Kibriyā’ ridā’ī, wa al-‘aẓamah izārī.\"\"Pride is My upper garment and greatness is My lower garment.\"1This statement presents a profound theological problem. If Allah is said to wear an upper and lower garment — metaphorically or literally — it implies a physical form upon which these garments rest. This raises critical philosophical and theological concerns about the supposed incorporeal nature of Allah. If Allah has garments, does He then have a body to adorn them? And if He has a body, is He not then comparable to created beings, contradicting His own claim in the Qur'an:لَيْسَ كَمِثْلِهِ شَيْءٌ\"There is nothing like unto Him.\"(Qur'an 42:11)Thus, the claim of Allah’s transcendence is undermined by this hadith.2. Allah Has Eyes, Hands, Ears, and FeetIn another well-known Hadith Qudsi recorded in Sahih al-Bukhari, Allah says:“…And My servant does not draw near to Me with anything more beloved to Me than the religious duties I have obligated upon him; and My servant continues to draw near to Me with supererogatory works so that I shall love him. And when I love him, I become his hearing with which he hears, his sight with which he sees, his hand with which he strikes, and his foot with which he walks.”2In this passage, Allah claims to possess ears, eyes, hands, and feet, once again implying anthropomorphic attributes. While Islamic scholars have classically attempted to interpret such narrations metaphorically (ta’wīl) or consign their meaning to Allah (tafwīḍ), the explicit wording of these narrations leaves significant ambiguity.If one upholds the literal reading, as many traditionalists (Ahl al-Hadith) have, it would imply that Allah possesses bodily attributes akin to His creation, directly violating the Qur'anic proclamation of uniqueness and incomparability.The Theological DilemmaDear readers, it is now evident that according to Islamic hadith literature, Allah is described in terms familiar to human beings — wearing garments, possessing sensory organs, and bodily limbs. This undermines the claim that Allah is utterly unlike His creation and exposes a serious doctrinal contradiction within Islamic theology.If Allah is attributed with garments and physical traits, how then can He be fundamentally different from created beings? This conundrum raises difficult questions for the doctrine of divine transcendence in Islam and warrants deeper examination.ConclusionThis analysis reveals profound inconsistencies within Islamic theology regarding the nature of Allah. While the Qur'an categorically denies that anything resembles Allah, several authentic hadith narrations attribute to Him anthropomorphic characteristics. These contradictions cannot be dismissed lightly, as they touch upon the very essence of divinity and the nature of God as understood within Islam.ReferencesBibliographyAl-Bukhari, Muhammad ibn Ismail.Sahih al-Bukhari.

The study draws from canonical Christian Scriptures and Islamic primary sources—the Qur’an and Hadith literature—to demonstrate the fundamental doctrinal differences in eschatological beliefs concerning the afterlife in Christianity and Islam.Introduction:The nature of the afterlife has long been a central theme in both Christian and Islamic theology. While both faiths affirm the existence of an afterlife, their descriptions of its nature, rewards, and experiences differ considerably. This paper examines the biblical vision of heaven and contrasts it with the Qur’anic and Hadith descriptions of paradise, raising critical theological reflections.1. The Christian Concept of Heaven:According to Luke 20:34–36 (New International Version):\"Jesus replied, 'The people of this age marry and are given in marriage. But those who are considered worthy of taking part in the age to come and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage, and they can no longer die; for they are like the angels. They are God’s children, since they are children of the resurrection.'\"This passage confirms that in the Christian heaven, there is no marriage, for the redeemed will possess spiritual bodies (1 Corinthians 15:43–54). Additionally, Romans 14:17 affirms:\"For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.\"Further, Revelation 7:16–17 states:\"Never again will they hunger; never again will they thirst. The sun will not beat down on them, nor any scorching heat. For the Lamb at the center of the throne will be their shepherd; ‘he will lead them to springs of living water.’ ‘And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.’\"This biblical portrayal focuses on spiritual fulfillment, communion with God, and eternal peace without physical indulgences.2. The Islamic Concept of Paradise (Jannah):In contrast, the Islamic depiction of paradise includes tangible and sensual rewards:i)Palatial Mansions:Qur’an 39:20 (Surat Az-Zumar):\"But those who feared their Lord will have lofty dwellings, one above another, beneath which rivers flow. [That is] the promise of Allah. Never does Allah fail in His promise.\"ii)Rivers of various drinks and fruits:Qur’an 47:15 (Surat Muhammad):\"A description of the Paradise which the righteous are promised: In it are rivers of unpolluted water, rivers of milk the taste of which never changes, rivers of wine delicious to those who drink, and rivers of purified honey, in which they will have all kinds of fruits, and forgiveness from their Lord.\"Qur’an 2:25 (Surat Al-Baqarah):\"And give good tidings to those who believe and do righteous deeds that they will have gardens [in Paradise] beneath which rivers flow. Whenever they are provided with a provision of fruit therefrom, they will say, ‘This is what we were provided with before.’ And it is given to them in likeness. And they will have therein purified spouses, and they will abide therein eternally.\"iii)Provision of Women and Sexual Rewards:Qur’an 56:21–23 (Surat Al-Waqi‘ah):\"And the flesh of fowls, any that they may desire. And [there will be] fair ones with wide, lovely eyes, like unto hidden pearls.\"Qur’an 37:48–49 (Surat As-Saffat):\"And with them will be women limiting [their] glances, with large, [beautiful] eyes, as if they were [delicate] eggs, well protected.\"Qur’an 37:44–46:\"They will be on thrones facing each other. There will be circulated among them a cup [of wine] from a flowing spring, white and delicious to the drinkers.\"iv)Hadith Description of Sexual Rewards:Hadith literature further elaborates on these sensual aspects. In Sunan Ibn Majah, Vol. 5, Hadith No. 4337:\"It was narrated from Abu Umamah that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: 'Allah will not admit anyone into Paradise except Allah, the Mighty and Glorious, will marry him to seventy-two wives, two from the women of Paradise (Hur al-‘Ayn) and seventy from his inheritance of the people of Hell. Every one of them will have a pleasant vagina, and the male’s sexual organ will never become flaccid.'\"3. Critical Reflection:From a Christian theological perspective, such physical and sensual indulgences in the afterlife appear incongruent with the biblical portrayal of heaven. Christianity teaches that worldly pleasures such as alcohol, sexual relations, and material opulence belong to earthly life, while the eternal kingdom of God transcends physical needs and is characterized by righteousness, peace, and the beatific vision of God.Conclusion:The comparison above highlights substantial theological divergences between Christian and Islamic eschatologies. While Christianity envisages heaven as a realm of spiritual glorification, eternal communion with God, and freedom from earthly desires, Islam offers a paradise of physical pleasures and sensual rewards. This raises important questions about the theological nature of each religion’s ultimate hope and conception of divine-human fellowship in eternity.References:The Holy Bible, New International Version (NIV)The Holy Qur’an, translations by Abdullah Yusuf Ali and Saheeh InternationalSunan Ibn Majah, Vol. 5, Hadith No. 4337Bibliography:Ali, Abdullah Yusuf.The Meaning of the Holy Qur'an.

It critiques the Islamic concept of resurrection, particularly the idea ofAjab al-Dhanab(a supposed indestructible part of the human body), and juxtaposes it with the biblically founded Christian doctrine of bodily resurrection as affirmed through Jesus Christ. Scriptural references from both the Qur’an and the Bible are critically examined in light of doctrinal coherence, theological consistency, and eschatological hope.1. IntroductionThe doctrine of resurrection is fundamental in both Islamic and Christian eschatology. However, the nature, mechanics, and theological implications of resurrection differ significantly between these two Abrahamic faiths. This article investigates the Islamic notion that human resurrection on the Day of Judgment involves theAjab al-Dhanab— a minute, indestructible part of the human body — and challenges its coherence when compared to the Christian understanding of resurrection through Jesus Christ.2. Islamic Concept of Resurrection and theAjab al-DhanabDoctrine2.1 The Three Components of Human Beings in DeathIslamic theology posits that upon death, the three fundamental components of human beings return to their origin:Thebody(composed of dust) returns to the earth.Thesoulis taken to a metaphysical state known asBarzakh.A minute, indestructible seed calledAjab al-Dhanabremains intact in the earth.According toSurah Qaf 50:4, Allah states:\"We know what the earth diminishes of them, and with Us is a retaining Book.\"This verse is interpreted by Muslim scholars to suggest that part of the body is preserved for future resurrection.2.2Ajab al-Dhanab: The Seed of ResurrectionAjab al-Dhanab, said to originate from Adam’s spine, is described as a tiny, indestructible element of the human being that survives decomposition. Islamic hadith literature (Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawud, An-Nasa’i, Malik’s Muwatta) records Prophet Muhammad asserting:“Every part of the son of Adam decays exceptAjab al-Dhanab, and from it he will be resurrected.”The claim continues that on the Day of Judgment, Allah will send down rain that causes this part to sprout like a seed, regenerating the human body.2.3 Qur’anic Analogies of Botanical ResurrectionThe Qur’an compares resurrection to the sprouting of plants after rainfall:“And He brings the living out of the dead, and brings the dead out of the living, and revives the earth after its death, and likewise will you be brought out.”—(Surah Ar-Rum 30:19)Muhammad is reported to have illustrated this by asking a companion whether he had seen a barren land bloom after rainfall — likening that renewal to bodily resurrection.3. Critical Evaluation of the Islamic DoctrineThe Islamic resurrection model presents conceptual difficulties. The assertion that human beings originate fromAjab al-Dhanab, and not solely from dust as traditionally believed, introduces a theological inconsistency. If human beings are created from dust (as stated elsewhere in the Qur’an), how then can resurrection depend on a microscopic indestructible component?Further, the argument that this seed remains physically intact after death — observable only with a powerful microscope — raises scientific and philosophical concerns about the feasibility and universality of such a claim.The analogy with plant biology, though poetic, oversimplifies the complexity of human anatomy and divine action. Resurrection is thereby reduced to a mechanistic biological process, lacking the spiritual depth and divine sovereignty emphasized in biblical theology.4. Christian Doctrine of Resurrection: A Christocentric Hope4.1 Foundational Teachings on ResurrectionResurrection is a foundational doctrine in Christianity, as outlined inHebrews 6:1–2. Jesus Christ’s resurrection is the archetype and guarantee of the resurrection of all the dead:“But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.”—(1 Corinthians 15:20–23)Christ’s resurrection was foretold by Himself (Matthew 16:21; 17:22–23; Luke 18:31–34), and fulfilled as recorded in the Gospels. The reality of His resurrection affirms the hope of believers.4.2 Biblical Passages Supporting the Resurrection of the DeadLuke 14:13–14: “You will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.”John 5:28–29: “All who are in the graves will hear His voice and come forth.”1 Thessalonians 4:16: “The dead in Christ will rise first.”These scriptures place the authority of resurrection not on a biological remnant (Ajab al-Dhanab), but on the sovereign power of God through Christ.4.3 Rebutting Historical ObjectionsWhen the resurrection of Christ was denied, the Gospel accounts provide not only historical claims but counter the false narratives, such as:The bribery of Roman soldiers to lie about Jesus' body being stolen (Matthew 28:11–15).The logical contradiction: If soldiers were asleep, how could they identify the perpetrators?Despite skepticism, the resurrection of Christ remains the cornerstone of Christian faith and the assurance of future bodily resurrection.5. Conclusion: Theological and Logical Consistency in the Doctrine of ResurrectionThe Islamic view of resurrection viaAjab al-Dhanabis fraught with theological and logical inconsistencies. It conflates physical determinism with spiritual rebirth and depends heavily on metaphor without adequate scriptural or scientific support.Conversely, the Christian doctrine of resurrection, rooted in the person and work of Jesus Christ, offers a coherent and hopeful eschatology. It affirms the power of God, the promise of eternal life, and the future bodily resurrection of all believers — not on account of a microscopic remnant, but by the victory of Christ over death.“If we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with Him those who sleep in Jesus.”—(1 Thessalonians 4:14)ReferencesThe Holy Bible (ESV, NIV, KJV)The Qur’an (Transl.

    "full_content": "Title: The Quran’s Inconsistencies and Contradictory Claims: A Theological and Scholarly InquiryBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstitutePublished: July 21, 2015AbstractThis article critically examines several internal inconsistencies and scientifically questionable claims found within the Quran. While many Muslims assert that the Bible has been corrupted and that the Quran alone remains the unaltered word of God, this study argues that the Quran itself contains numerous contradictions that challenge its claim to divine authorship. Through a comparative textual and theological analysis, this paper presents key contradictions and scientific errors as evidence of the Quran’s human origin rather than divine inspiration.IntroductionMuslims have often endeavored to demonstrate that the Holy Bible has been corrupted, seeking to establish the Quran as the only true and unaltered word of God. However, such claims are not only historically unfounded but also internally inconsistent when examined alongside the Quran’s own text. The following analysis presents several passages within the Quran that raise serious theological, logical, and scientific concerns. Each example is discussed to highlight the textual contradictions that undermine the claim of Quranic inerrancy.1.The Destruction of the People of ‘ĀdSurah 54:19states that the city of ‘Ād was destroyed“in one day”.Surah 69:6–7, however, claims that they were destroyed over“seven nights and eight days.”This contradiction presents a chronological inconsistency. If the Quran is the literal word of an all-knowing deity, there should not be such disparity in describing the same event.Reference:Qur’an 54:19Qur’an 69:6–72.The Angelic Visitation to MarySurah 19:17depicts a single angel appearing to Mary.Surah 3:42mentions multiple angels addressing her.The contradiction raises questions about whether the visitation involved one or several angels. Such inconsistencies in divine revelation challenge the notion of a perfect and consistent message from God.Reference:Qur’an 19:17Qur’an 3:423.The Death of PharaohSurah 28:40states that Pharaoh drowned and perished in the sea.Surah 10:92indicates that Pharaoh survived, as God preserved his body as a sign for future generations.This presents a theological paradox—did Pharaoh die, or was he saved? Both cannot simultaneously be true.Reference:Qur’an 28:40Qur’an 10:924.The Sun Setting in a Muddy SpringSurah 18:86claims that the sun sets in a spring of murky water.From a scientific perspective, this assertion is untenable. The sun, with a surface temperature exceeding 6,000°C, cannot physically set into any earthly spring. This description contradicts the established understanding of celestial mechanics.Reference:Qur’an 18:865.The Shape of the EarthSurah 15:19describes the earth as“spread out flat.”Modern astronomy and physics confirm that the Earth is spherical. Thus, this Quranic description reflects pre-scientific cosmology rather than divine omniscience.Reference:Qur’an 15:196.The Origin of SemenSurah 86:6–7claims that semen originates from between the backbone and the ribs.Modern biology conclusively demonstrates that semen is produced in the testes, not between the spine and the ribs. This statement reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of human anatomy, suggesting a human rather than divine source.Reference:Qur’an 86:6–77.Mary as the Sister of AaronSurah 19:27–28identifies Mary (the mother of Jesus) as the“sister of Aaron.”Historically, Aaron, the brother of Moses, lived approximately 1,300 years before Mary. This conflation of two distinct individuals named Mary reveals a significant historical and genealogical error.Reference:Qur’an 19:27–288.Pharaoh and Haman as ContemporariesSurah 28:8claims that Pharaoh and Haman lived and worked together.Historical and archaeological evidence, however, shows that Pharaoh (of Egypt) and Haman (of Persia, during the time of Esther) lived approximately a millennium apart and in entirely different empires. Such historical inaccuracies further discredit the Quran’s claim to divine revelation.Reference:Qur’an 28:8ConclusionThe inconsistencies and scientific errors identified within the Quran raise serious doubts about its divine origin. If a text attributed to an omniscient God contains demonstrable contradictions and factual inaccuracies, then its claim to inerrancy cannot stand. Instead, these internal discrepancies suggest human authorship influenced by the cultural, historical, and scientific limitations of seventh-century Arabia.This analysis underscores the need for honest theological reflection and comparative scriptural study. The Quran, while a significant historical and religious text, cannot be upheld as the flawless word of God when examined through critical, rational, and empirical inquiry.ReferencesThe Qur’an, Surah 54:19; 69:6–7; 19:17; 3:42; 28:40; 10:92; 18:86; 15:19; 86:6–7; 19:27–28; 28:8.Ali, A.

    "full_content": "Title: Muslims Worship Celestial Bodies and Idols: A Biblical CritiqueAuthor: Prophet HebronDate: Tuesday, July 21, 2015Source: Max Shimba Ministries OrgAbstractThis article explores the biblical prohibition of idolatry and critiques certain religious practices—specifically in Islam—perceived as celestial worship, such as reverence for the moon, stars, and sun. Using scriptural references, it warns against substituting the Creator with created objects in worship and calls for repentance and exclusive devotion to the God of the Bible, the Father of Jesus Christ.1.Biblical Foundation Against IdolatryThe foundation of the article is rooted inExodus 20:1–6, where God commands the Israelites to worship no other gods and forbids the making or veneration of any graven images:“I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. You shall have no other gods before me. You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below. You shall not bow down to them or worship them…”(Exodus 20:1–6, NIV)This passage forms the core of the argument: any act of bowing to, revering, or serving created objects—whether celestial bodies like themoon,stars, andsun, or man-made images—is a violation of God's commandments.2.Condemnation of Celestial WorshipThe article asserts that certain religious practices today, including those within Islam, involve acts that the Bible equates to idolatry. It highlights:Reverence for the moon and stars, often symbolically or ritually expressed.The belief that honoring celestial elements in worship contradicts biblical theology, whereonly the Creatoris worthy of worship.The article stresses that although God created these celestial bodies, worshiping them—or involving them in religious practice—constitutes abetrayal of divine authorityand aligns the worshipper with false deities.3.Historical Context: The Golden CalfThe narrative of thegolden calfinExodus 32is cited as a historical example of human inclination toward idolatry. While Moses was on Mount Sinai, the Israelites, under Aaron's leadership, constructed a golden calf and worshiped it, inciting God's anger.This, according to the article, parallels modern practices where people:Construct or honorimages, statues, and symbols,Assign spiritual or ritualistic significance to created objects,Misrepresent such practices as legitimate forms of honoring God.4.Theological Implication and Divine JealousyThe article underscores God’s declaration of being ajealous Godwho punishes those who hate Him to the third and fourth generation, but shows mercy to those who love Him and keep His commandments. This is reiterated to stress theseriousness of spiritual fidelity.5.New Testament Affirmation: Salvation in Christ AloneThe conclusion turns toNew Testament theology, specificallyRomans 10:9, affirming that:“If you declare with your mouth, ‘Jesus is Lord,’ and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.”Thus, salvation and entry into heaven require:Acknowledgment ofJesus Christas Lord and Savior,Baptism by immersion(symbolized by flowing water, e.g., the Jordan River),Alife of holiness and obedienceto God's Word.6.A Call to RepentanceThe article closes with aprayer of repentance, inviting the reader to forsake idolatrous practices and submit fully to Jesus Christ. This is presented as the only path to eternal life and reconciliation with God.7.ConclusionThe core message is thatworshiping celestial bodies, images, or any created object is incompatible with biblical worship. True worship is directed exclusively toYahweh, the God of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and the Father of Jesus Christ. The article issues a warning that those who persist in such practices risk eternal separation from God.Recommended Citation:Shimba, Max.\"Muslims Worship Celestial Bodies and Idols: A Biblical Critique.\"Max Shimba Ministries Org, July 21, 2015.",

A Theological Reflection on the Islamic Ritual of Stoning the DevilBy Max Shimba Ministries Org.Originally Published: July 15, 2015AbstractThis article examines the Islamic ritual of stoning the devil during the Hajj pilgrimage and critically evaluates its theological implications. The piece questions the rationale behind this practice and contrasts it with biblical revelation. It seeks to provoke reflection on whether such a ritual is consistent with a monotheistic belief in an all-powerful God.IntroductionDear brothers and sisters, this article brings to light a controversial aspect of the Islamic pilgrimage (Hajj). As unbelievable as it may sound, during the Hajj, Muslims participate in a ritual act of throwing stones at structures symbolizing Satan. This act occurs in Mina, near Mecca, and follows what is believed to be a prophetic tradition (Sunnah). But what does this signify theologically? Does Satan physically reside in Mecca? What are the origins of this ritual? These are the critical questions this article explores.The Ritual of Stoning in HajjOn the 10th day of Dhu al-Hijjah, pilgrims depart from Muzdalifah and collect stones along the way. Islamic tradition prescribes that on this first day, only seven stones are to be thrown, in accordance with prophetic practice.According to a Hadith:“The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) delayed stoning until after the sun had risen…”(Reported by At-Tirmidhi)Those with valid excuses may delay stoning until sunset, although it is preferable to perform the act between noon (Zawal) and sunset.At Mina, the ritual of stoning the devil begins. Pilgrims throw seven stones at a pillar known asJamrat al-Aqabah, which symbolizes Satan. This practice is repeated during the nights of the 11th, 12th, and for some, the 13th of Dhu al-Hijjah.Critical ObservationsThe question arises: does Satan have a physical body that can be harmed by stones? Is Allah incapable of defeating Satan without the help of humans pelting him with stones?The fact that Muslims throw stones at a fixed structure year after year suggests a ritualistic personification of Satan. If Satan is indeed a spiritual being, how effective can physical stones be? This ritual appears more symbolic than efficacious, yet it holds a central place in Hajj.Moreover, the ritual is performed at night for three consecutive days—another element that raises questions about its purpose and meaning.Du'a After StoningAfter stoning each of the first two pillars (Jamaraat), pilgrims are encouraged to face the Qiblah and offer supplications (du‘a). However, after stoning the third (largest) pillar, no such prayer is prescribed.“The Prophet (peace be upon him) used to pray after throwing each Jamaraat, except after the last one.”(Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Imam Ahmad)This structure raises theological concerns: why omit prayer after the final act of stoning? What differentiates the last pillar from the rest?Departure from Mina: The Hastening Day (Yawm al-Isti’jaal)Pilgrims who choose to stay only two days in Mina may leave on the 12th of Dhu al-Hijjah before sunset. However, if they remain past sunset, they are obliged to stay a third day. For those with no pressing responsibilities, remaining for the third night is encouraged.The Farewell Circumambulation (Tawaf al-Wida’)Before departing Mecca, pilgrims must perform a farewell circumambulation (Tawaf al-Wida’). This involves circling the Ka‘bah seven times without performing Sa‘i (the walk between Safa and Marwah), which was done earlier in the pilgrimage.Theological ReflectionThere is no mention in the Torah, the Psalms, or the Gospels (Injil) where God commands His people to stone Satan. This ritual is found exclusively in Islamic tradition and lacks biblical precedent. It contradicts the nature of God as revealed in the Bible—an omnipotent Being who needs no human assistance to defeat the devil.Is it reasonable for a person to collect stones and throw them at a symbolic representation of Satan? Does this ritual have divine efficacy? Is it not an act based more on folklore than revealed scripture?Conclusion and AppealThe practice of stoning the devil in Mina suggests a ritualistic tradition devoid of biblical foundation. It also hints at a deeper theological confusion—depicting Satan as having a location and a tangible presence subject to physical attack.We encourage all Christians around the world to pray for our Muslim brothers and sisters. Many travel across continents to participate in a ritual of stoning Satan, unaware that true victory over evil comes only through Jesus Christ.Challenging Questions for MuslimsWhat spiritual benefit is derived from stoning Satan?Where in the Abrahamic scriptures is Abraham shown stoning Satan?Why is this ritual exclusive to Islamic sources and absent from the Torah, Psalms, and Gospels?We invite you to consider the person and power ofJesus Christ, the true conqueror of Satan.“Then the God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet.”(Romans 16:20)Max Shimba Ministries Org.July 2015",

    "full_content": "Monday, July 13, 2015HOW THE APOSTLE PAUL DEPRIVES MUSLIMS OF SLEEPBy Maxwell Shimba Ministries OrgAmong the people who most trouble our Muslim brethren is the hero of the Lord Jesus — the Apostle Paul. This opposition did not begin with Muslims alone; it started long ago with those who upheld the Law during Paul’s time — the Pharisees, the chief priests, the scribes, and the ordinary Jews who followed Judaism.Muslims are simply continuing the same old spirit of opposition against the saving Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.Below are some of the reasons Muslims often give for rejecting the Apostle Paul, as I encountered them on a Facebook post by a Muslim brother:ONE: They claim that Paul prohibited circumcision; that’s why most Christians today are uncircumcised.Answer:Circumcision is merely a matter of physical health; it has no relation to entering heaven. If you choose to be circumcised, it benefits your body, not your soul. What goes to heaven is the soul, not the body. Whether circumcised or not, the body decays in the grave.Therefore, God used circumcision as a symbol of spiritual truth, not physical ritual.Deuteronomy 10:16:“Circumcise your hearts, therefore, and do not be stiff-necked any longer.”Deuteronomy 30:6:“The LORD your God will circumcise your hearts and the hearts of your descendants, so that you may love Him with all your heart and with all your soul, and live.”Jeremiah 4:4:“Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, circumcise your hearts, you people of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem, or my wrath will flare up and burn like fire because of the evil you have done.”TWO: They claim Paul was a terrorist who killed Jesus’ followers, then pretended to be their apostle in order to destroy them intellectually.Answer:That’s a laughable argument. Since when have you cared about the disciples of Jesus? What do you say about the extremist groups that kill Christians today, destroy churches, and force people to worship false gods? Do you condemn them?Paul was indeed a persecutorbeforeknowing Christ — just as all of us were sinners before meeting Christ. And Jesus said:Luke 5:31–32:“It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”Jesus calls sinners so that He may give them new hearts filled with love, compassion, and service toward others. If Paul was once a murderer, the only one who had the right to complain would be Jesus Himself — not you, who harbor hatred against Paul.THREE: They claim Paul introduced homosexuality to the world.Answer:That is a lie from the pit of hell. Paul clearly condemns homosexuality:1 Corinthians 6:9:“Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men.”Think carefully — who is deceiving whom? It is you deceiving yourself.FOUR: They claim Paul said alcohol is medicine.Answer:That too is false. Paul only advised Timothy to usea little winefor stomach ailments:1 Timothy 5:23:“Stop drinking only water, and use a little wine because of your stomach and your frequent illnesses.”Paul was not encouraging drunkenness or recreational drinking. He meanta little wine for medical purposes.If you are not sick but crave wine, you are simply a drunkard. Moreover, today there are many effective medicines for stomach issues.The same Paul also said:Ephesians 5:18:“Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery. Instead, be filled with the Spirit.”FIVE: They claim Paul said God looks at the spirit, not the body, hence Christians dress immodestly.Answer:Firstly, it wasn’t Paul alone who emphasized the heart’s purity. Jesus Himself said:Matthew 23:25–27:“Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence... You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of the bones of the dead.”Secondly, the Bible never condones nudity or indecency. Paul wrote:1 Corinthians 8:13:“If what I eat causes my brother to fall into sin, I will never eat meat again, so that I will not cause him to fall.”That means if your behavior causes others to sin — even if it seems harmless — you will be judged.Paul also wrote:1 Timothy 2:9:“I also want women to dress modestly, with decency and propriety, not with elaborate hairstyles or gold or pearls or expensive clothes.”And Jesus warned:Matthew 18:7:“Woe to the world because of the things that cause people to stumble! Such things must come, but woe to the person through whom they come!”SIX: They claim Paul said people should greet one another with a kiss, and he called it holy.Answer:When someone hates you, everything you do will be twisted. Paul spoke of aholy kiss, not a carnal one. If I tell you, “Drink clean water,” am I wrong?A “holy kiss” symbolizes pure fellowship among believers, not immorality. The problem lies not in the act but in the evil heart of the accuser.SEVEN: They claim Paul said all foods are permissible.Answer:Not only Paul said this — even Jesus Himself declared it:Matthew 15:15–20:“Don’t you see that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then out of the body?... But the things that come out of a person’s mouth come from the heart, and these defile them.”Every culture has its dietary norms. If others eat dogs, snakes, or snails, let them be — for what goes into the stomach does not defile the soul.EIGHT: They claim Paul created a mixed religion called Christianity.Answer:We follow Christ Jesus — just as Paul followed Christ. Do you know Paul better than Peter, who lived and ministered with him?Peter wrote:2 Peter 3:15–17:“Bear in mind that our Lord’s patience means salvation, just as our dear brother Paul also wrote you with the wisdom that God gave him... His letters contain some things that are hard to understand, which ignorant and unstable people distort, as they do the other Scriptures, to their own destruction.”If someone chooses to reject Paul and side with those who oppose him, that’s their choice — but we will not abandon the faithful servants of Jesus Christ to embrace lies born of hatred.NINE: They claim Paul alone said Jesus is God Almighty, while Jesus denied it.Answer:Did Paul write the book of Isaiah?Isaiah 9:6:“For to us a child is born... and He will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.”Did Paul write the Gospel of John?John 1:1:“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.”Clearly, the divinity of Christ was revealed long before Paul.TEN: They claim Paul brought the Gospel to the Gentiles when it was meant for Israel only.Answer:Long before Paul, God had declared salvation for all nations. Jesus Himself commanded:Matthew 28:19:“Go therefore and make disciples of all nations...”John 3:17:“For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through Him.”John 12:47:“I did not come to judge the world, but to save it.”John 10:16:“I have other sheep that are not of this sheepfold; I must bring them also.”Matthew 24:14:“This gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.”ELEVEN: They claim Paul insulted the Law by calling it a curse.Answer:The Law itself is not a curse — rather, breaking it brings a curse. The command “Do not steal” is not evil; the thief brings the curse upon himself, not the Law.Paul wrote:Romans 7:12–13:“So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous, and good... But sin, in order that it might be recognized as sin, produced death in me through what was good.”Thus, saying Paul called the Law a curse is false and a distortion of Scripture.TWELVE: They claim Paul abolished the Law, despite Jesus saying it would not pass away.Answer:Jesus said inMatthew 5:18: “Until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.”This means the Law remainsuntilits fulfillment. For example, prophecy said the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem — and that has already been fulfilled (Matthew 2:6).Therefore, if you still cling to prophecies that have already been fulfilled, you’ve misunderstood Scripture.CONCLUSION: HOW LONG WILL YOU BE DECEIVED?How long will you embrace destruction? Hatred blinds the heart and drives a person to spread lies — which he eventually believes himself, deceiving his own soul.As the prophet Isaiah said:Matthew 13:14:“You will indeed hear but never understand; you will indeed see but never perceive.”© Maxwell Shimba Ministries OrgJuly 13, 2015",

    "full_content": "ISLAM’S DISDAIN FOR AFRICANSBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteOriginally published: July 1, 2015AbstractThis essay examines the racial dynamics embedded within Islamic historical development and doctrine, focusing particularly on Islam’s historical relationship with Africans and people of African descent. It challenges the claim that Islam is a religion of the Black race or originated in Africa. Drawing primarily from Islamic canonical sources such as theQur’anandHadith—specificallySahih al-BukhariandSahih Muslim—this study demonstrates that the origins, leadership, and teachings of Islam neither arose from Africa nor favored the African people.1. IntroductionIn recent decades, certain Muslim advocates have attempted to persuade African Americans that Islam is inherently a Black religion and that Prophet Muhammad himself was Black. Such claims are strategically directed at Black communities but seldom presented to White audiences. This rhetoric serves a propagandist aim: to appeal to racial identity rather than theological truth.It is crucial to clarify from the outset that this analysis does not endorse racial prejudice of any form. The acceptance or rejection of Islam—or any religion—should rest upon its theological, ethical, and spiritual merits, not on racial or ethnic identity.2. Africa Was Not the Cradle of IslamIslam was born in the 7th century A.D. on the Arabian Peninsula, geographically located in Asia. The Red Sea separates Asia from the African continent, thus distinguishing them as two distinct regions both racially and geographically. Islam, therefore, is not an African-born faith.By contrast, Christianity had already reached Africa centuries earlier. St. Mark, the Jewish author of the Gospel of Mark, evangelized in Egypt during the first century. From Egypt, Christianity spread throughout North and East Africa. Figures such as St. Moses the Black and St. Tekle Haymanot of Ethiopia became prominent African saints. The New Testament itself records early African participation in Christianity, such asSimon Niger(Acts 13:1) and the Ethiopian eunuch baptized by Philip (Acts 8:26–40).When African slaves were later brought to the Americas, the majority had either been Christians or practitioners of traditional African religions, not Muslims.3. Muhammad Was Not BlackProphet Muhammad was an Arabian of Asian descent, not a Black African. Numerous authenticHadithsconfirm that Muhammad was light-skinned or white in complexion.For example:Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 1, Hadith 63 records: “While we were sitting with the Prophet, a man came and asked, ‘Who among you is Muhammad?’ We replied, ‘This white man reclining on his arm.’”Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 2, Hadith 122 describes him as “a white man,” while Vol. 2, Hadith 141 mentions “the whiteness of his armpits was visible when he raised his hands.”These authentic narrations leave no doubt that Muhammad was not of African origin nor of dark complexion.4. Muhammad Owned Black SlavesIslamic historical records reveal that Muhammad owned and traded Black slaves. Among them were Bilal, Abu Hurairah, Usama ibn Zayd, and a servant boy named Rabbah.Even today, in Arabic-speaking regions such as Saudi Arabia—the birthplace of Islam—the term“ʿAbd”(عبد), literally meaning “slave,” is often used to describe Black individuals, reflecting a persistent racial hierarchy.InSahih Muslim(Vol. 7, p. 83), Muhammad is reported to have sold a Black slave for 800 dirhams. Moreover, Islamic law distinguished between the punishments of free men and enslaved women, treating the latter as property rather than persons of equal worth (Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 8, Hadith 821–822).5. Islam’s Degrading View of Black PeopleIslamic scriptures andHadithscontain numerous derogatory references to Black people. For instance, Muhammad referred to Black individuals as “raisin heads” (Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 1, Hadith 662; Vol. 9, Hadith 256).AnotherHadithrecords Muhammad saying, “Black people steal when hungry, and when they are full, they commit fornication” (Sahih Muslim). In another narration, he instructed followers to obey even “a slave with a flat nose” (Sahih Muslim, Vol. 9, pp. 46–47)—a phrase widely interpreted as a racial insult referring to Black people.These statements reveal a theological framework that, historically, did not view Africans as equals but rather as inferior subjects.6. Islam and the Absence of Freedom and EqualityEven if one were to assume incorrectly that Islam originated in Africa or that its Prophet was Black, these facts would still not make Islam a suitable faith for people of African descent—or for anyone who values liberty and equality.Islamic law (Sharia) fundamentally contradicts principles of human freedom and civil rights. The Qur’an itself declares:“Whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him” (Surah 3:85).Islamic jurisprudence limits the rights of women, endorses slavery, and mandates religious conformity. Examples include:Men are superior to women (Surah 2:228).Women’s testimony is worth half that of a man (Surah 2:282).Women inherit half the share of men (Surah 4:11).Men may beat their wives (Surah 4:34).A man may have up to four wives simultaneously (Surah 4:3).Muslims must fight non-Muslims until they submit (Surah 9:5).Muslims must not befriend Jews or Christians (Surah 5:51).Apostates must be killed (Surah 9:12).Theft is punished by amputation (Surah 5:38).Adultery is punished by flogging (Surah 24:2).Islamic governance also rejects the separation of religion and state (Surah 2:193) and forbids opposition to religious authority (Surah 4:59).7. A Call to African AmericansTo African Americans who are told that “Islam is the religion of the Black man,” such claims are deceptive and racially manipulative. If Islam truly valued Black lives, then why are Black Christians in regions such as Sudan being enslaved and slaughtered by their Muslim counterparts to this very day? (See: U.S. State Department Report,International Religious Freedom, May 26, 1993).By contrast, Jesus Christ came to liberate humanity from every form of bondage—spiritual and physical alike. The Apostle Paul writes:“There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus” (Galatians 3:28).8. Conclusion: Know the Truth and Be FreeThe distinction between Islamic doctrine and the teachings of Jesus Christ is profound. Islam subjugates; Christ liberates.“You shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free” (John 8:32).“Stand firm, then, and do not be entangled again with the yoke of bondage” (Galatians 5:1–2).Know the truth. Follow the truth. Share the truth.By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteOrlando, Florida",

    "full_content": "Prophet Muhammad as a Sinner: An Academic and Theological AnalysisIntroductionWhile the Christian Scriptures declare Jesus Christ to be sinless (Hebrews 4:15; 2 Corinthians 5:21), both the Qur’an and the Hadith present a markedly different portrait of the Prophet Muhammad. This article systematically examines canonical Islamic sources to highlight instances where Muhammad is depicted as a sinner—requiring forgiveness, participating in violence, and engaging in morally questionable acts. The analysis will compare these findings with the Christian concept of the sinlessness of Christ, raising theological and ethical questions about the implications for soteriology in Islam and Christianity.1. Muhammad’s Participation in Raids and the Acquisition of Spoils1.1 Historical ContextEarly Islamic history documents several military raids (ghazawat) led or sanctioned by Muhammad, during which the property of others was seized and captives were taken. According toSahih al-Bukhari, Volume 3, Book 37, Number 495, “When Allah made the Prophet rich through victories, one-fifth of the war booty was placed in the treasury.” Likewise,Sahih Muslim, Volume 2, Book 5, Chapter 401, Number 2348, states that Muhammad’s family shared in the spoils of war.The first recorded act of plundering by Muslims, known as the Nakhla Raid, occurred during the sacred months, a period traditionally respected for the cessation of hostilities. During this raid, Muhammad’s followers attacked a Quraysh caravan, killed a man, and enslaved the survivors, seizing their property (see Watt, 1956,Muhammad at Mecca, p. 136). Muhammad himself later led the significant Battle of Badr, where further spoils were gained (Qur’an 8:1, 8:41).At the conquest of the Jewish settlement of Khaybar, Muhammad and his followers again obtained considerable wealth and took women as captives (Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 5, Book 59, No. 512; Ibn Ishaq,Sirat Rasul Allah, pp. 510–515). Notably, after the siege of Banu Qurayza, between 700–900 men were executed, and women and children were taken as slaves (Ibn Ishaq,Sirat Rasul Allah, pp. 464–466; al-Tabari,History, vol. 8, pp. 35–40).1.2 Moral and Theological AssessmentFrom an ethical standpoint, such actions are considered grave sins by Christian standards, as they involve violence, theft, and the violation of the dignity and rights of others (Exodus 20:13, 15; Matthew 5:44). The New Testament’s Jesus, by contrast, is presented as rejecting violence (Matthew 26:52) and commanding love even for enemies.2. Muhammad’s Admission of Sin and the Command to Seek Forgiveness2.1 Qur’anic DirectivesThe Qur’an explicitly records Allah instructing Muhammad to seek forgiveness for his sins. Surah Ghafir (40:55) states:“So be patient, [O Muhammad]. Indeed, the promise of Allah is truth. And ask forgiveness for your sin and exalt [Allah] with praise of your Lord in the evening and the morning.” (Sahih International translation)Similarly, Surah al-Fath (48:1–2) reads:“Indeed, We have given you, [O Muhammad], a clear conquest. That Allah may forgive for you what preceded of your sin and what will follow and complete His favor upon you and guide you to a straight path.”2.2 Hadith TestimonyTheSahih Muslim, Vol. 1, Book 4, Chapter 268, Number 1695, records Muhammad’s prayer:“I have wronged myself and made repentance for my sins. Forgive my sins...”Other hadiths reinforce this, includingSahih al-BukhariVol. 1, Book 2, Chapter 13, Number 19, and Vol. 8, Book 75, Number 319, where Muhammad repeatedly asks for forgiveness. In several narrations, he admits to seeking forgiveness over seventy times a day (Sahih al-Bukhari Vol. 8, Book 75, Number 319).2.3 Punitive ActionsGrave punishments for criminals are reported in the hadiths, such as amputating hands and feet, gouging out eyes, and denying water until death (Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 8, Book 82, Numbers 794-796; Fiqh us-Sunnah, Vol. 1, p. 133). Such acts, in a Christian moral framework, would be considered inhumane and sinful.3. Theological Implications: The Problem of Sin and Atonement in Islam and ChristianityThe frequent Qur’anic and hadith references to Muhammad’s need for forgiveness and the acts attributed to him contrast sharply with the Christian doctrine of Christ’s sinlessness. In Christian theology, Jesus claims to pay the penalty for humanity’s sins (John 1:29; Romans 5:8; 1 Peter 2:22–24), providing a unique model for redemption.In Islam, no teaching asserts that Muhammad or anyone else pays for the sins of others; rather, forgiveness is based on Allah’s mercy, with no objective atonement (Qur’an 39:53). This raises questions about the justice of God and the means by which sins are actually remitted.4. Contemporary ReflectionsModern events have shown some Muslims justifying acts of violence by citing the Prophet’s actions as precedent, particularly in regions such as Sudan, Nigeria, and Indonesia. Conversely, when Christians perpetrate violence, it is often condemned as contrary to Christ’s teachings. Rarely is similar criticism leveled against Muslims who emulate the Prophet’s example in violence.It is vital for honest interfaith dialogue to confront these realities. Acts of violence, especially against those who worship God, should be unequivocally condemned regardless of the religious identity of the perpetrator. The model set by a religion’s founder profoundly impacts its adherents’ morality and worldview.ConclusionThe evidence from both the Qur’an and hadith literature unmistakably portrays Muhammad as a sinner who repeatedly seeks forgiveness for his transgressions. His participation in violence, acquisition of spoils, and admission of sin set him apart from the Christ of the New Testament, who is depicted as sinless and the redeemer of humanity.The ultimate question for Muslims remains: “Who pays for your sins?” Christianity offers an answer in Christ. Islam, by contrast, leaves the question open, relying on Allah’s discretion rather than atonement.The invitation stands: Come to the living Jesus, the true Savior, who alone offers forgiveness and eternal life.Reflection:Take action.Be saved.Max Shimba Ministries Org.May 26, 2015ReferencesThe Holy Bible, New International VersionThe Qur’an, Sahih International TranslationSahih al-Bukhari, various volumes and hadith numbers as cited aboveSahih Muslim, various volumes and hadith numbers as cited aboveIbn Ishaq,Sirat Rasul AllahAl-Tabari,The History of al-TabariFiqh us-Sunnah, Sayyid Sabiq, Vol. 1Watt, W.

Through religious lectures and various pamphlets, Muslims attempt to intimidate the Christian community by saying Jesus rejected His divinity. Are these claims true? Does this verse teach something deeper?To truly understand the Bible, you must read several verses to grasp what God is saying through His Word. Therefore, I have included verses 4 and 5 to clarify what Jesus was actually saying in John 17.Let me place all the verses here:John 17:3“And this is eternal life, that they might know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent.4I have glorified You on the earth; I have finished the work which You gave Me to do.5And now, O Father, glorify Me with Your own self with the glory which I had with You before the world was.”In verse 5 —[And now, O Father, glorify Me with Yourself with the glory I had with You before the world existed]— Jesus is saying that:He lived before the world existed!This gives us a real understanding of what Jesus was saying and who Jesus truly is. All belief systems acknowledge that the One who existed before all things is God. Yet in verse 5, Jesus claims pre-existence before creation.Jesus continues in the same verse, claiming that He had divine majesty — “GLORY.”Jesus tells God the Father toglorify Him with the glory He had before the world existed.Now, if Jesus is not God and is only an ordinary human being, why would He ask His Father to glorify Him? By what authority does Jesus claim glory that belongs to God alone?If Jesus is not God, then when He asked the Father to glorify Him, wouldn’t that be blasphemy?Yet we never read anywhere that Jesus committed any sin. Even Islam acknowledges that of all human beings who ever lived, Jesus alone lived without committing sin.Dear readers, the Muslim claim that John 17:3 denies the divinity of Jesus is completely false, because today we have learned from the same chapter that:Jesus existed before the world was created.Jesus possesses the glory of God.Verse 5 quotation:“And now, O Father, glorify Me with Yourself with the glory which I had with You before the world was.”Key Points:Jesus claims that He lived before the world was created.Jesus claims that He has glory like that of His Father.THEREFORE:Who is Jesus, that He claims divine glory — and that glory from God the Father Himself?Who is Jesus, that He says He existed before the creation of the world, and says this directly to God the Father?My beloved brothers and sisters,The discussion is complete, and it answers the Muslim allegation that Jesus denied His divinity in John 17:3.I welcome you all to Jesus Christ, the Living One. He is the way, the truth, and the life. Come to Him so that you may receive eternal life and life in abundance.In His service,Max ShimbaFor Max Shimba MinistriesApril 28, 2015 @ Max Shimba Ministries.",

    "full_content": "The Meaning of John 17:3 in Christian Theology: A Response to Muslim Claims Regarding the Divinity of Jesus ChristBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis article examines John 17:3—a verse frequently cited by Muslim apologists to argue against the divinity of Jesus Christ. It provides a theological and exegetical analysis of John 17:3–5 within the broader context of the Gospel of John, addresses Islamic objections, and demonstrates that, rather than denying His divinity, Jesus affirms His pre-existence and possession of divine glory, thereby supporting orthodox Christian claims regarding His deity.IntroductionIn contemporary interfaith dialogue, particularly in exchanges between Christian and Muslim apologists, John 17:3 has become a central proof-text for those seeking to deny the divinity of Jesus Christ. Many Islamic preachers and authors contend that, in this passage, Jesus explicitly distinguishes Himself from the “only true God,” thereby allegedly renouncing any claim to deity. This article critically examines such claims and provides a thorough theological interpretation of the passage, emphasizing the necessity of contextual and canonical readings of Scripture.The Contested Passage: John 17:3–5The Gospel of John 17:3–5 reads (NIV):“Now this is eternal life: that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent. I have brought you glory on earth by finishing the work you gave me to do. And now, Father, glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world began.”Muslim critics often isolate verse 3 to argue that Jesus disclaims divinity by distinguishing Himself from “the only true God.” However, a careful examination of verses 4 and 5 reveals a more nuanced and profound Christology.Exegetical and Theological Analysis1. Pre-Existence of ChristIn John 17:5, Jesus prays, “And now, Father, glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world began.” Here, Jesus explicitly claims pre-existence—an attribute unique to God in both biblical and Islamic theology. The assertion that Christ existed “before the world began” directly parallels the prologue of John’s Gospel (“In the beginning was the Word…” John 1:1) and affirms that Jesus possesses an existence that precedes creation itself. Within Christian doctrine, the pre-existence of Christ is foundational to His deity (cf. Philippians 2:5–7; Colossians 1:15–17).Scholarly PerspectiveCraig S. Keener notes that “pre-existence was not attributed to ordinary humans or even prophets; this is an explicitly divine prerogative in Second Temple Judaism.” (Keener,The Gospel of John: A Commentary, 2003).2. The Claim to Divine GloryJesus’ request, “glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world began,” is highly significant. In Isaiah 42:8, God declares, “I will not yield my glory to another.” Thus, for Jesus to claim shared glory with the Father before creation is a declaration of ontological unity with God. No mere human, prophet, or angel can make such a claim without committing blasphemy. Jesus' prayer, therefore, is not a denial but an implicit affirmation of His divine status.Theological InsightF. F. Bruce writes, “The glory which the Son requests to be restored to him is no less than the divine glory which belonged to him in the eternal fellowship of the Godhead.” (Bruce,The Gospel of John, 1983).3. Sinlessness of ChristEven within Islamic tradition, Jesus (‘Isa) is regarded as uniquely sinless among humankind (see Sahih Bukhari 4:55:641; Quran 19:19). If Jesus was merely a man, His request for divine glory would constitute blasphemy—unless He is truly who He claims to be: the eternal Son, worthy of the same honor as the Father (cf. John 5:23).Addressing the Muslim InterpretationMuslim apologists assert that Jesus' words in John 17:3 (“that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent”) represent a categorical denial of divinity. However, this interpretation overlooks several critical hermeneutical and theological points:Contextual Integrity: Verses 4 and 5 provide indispensable context, revealing Jesus’ pre-existence and shared divine glory.Johannine Christology: The entire Gospel of John is replete with statements affirming Christ’s divinity (e.g., John 1:1, 8:58, 10:30).Unity and Distinction: Trinitarian theology posits that the Son is distinct in person from the Father but shares in the same divine essence (homoousios). Thus, Jesus' distinction from the Father in John 17:3 is not a denial of deity but an affirmation of Trinitarian relationality.Implications for Eternal LifeJohn 17:3 states that eternal life consists in knowing the only true God and Jesus Christ. Rather than diminishing Jesus’ status, this places faith in Christ as essential for salvation—an emphasis echoed elsewhere in the New Testament (cf. John 14:6; 1 John 5:20). The unique and inseparable roles of the Father and the Son in granting eternal life further affirm the co-equal divinity of Jesus.ConclusionThe claim that John 17:3 constitutes a denial of Christ’s divinity does not withstand careful exegetical scrutiny. On the contrary, the passage, read in context and in light of biblical theology, affirms Jesus’ pre-existence, participation in divine glory, and essential unity with the Father. Christian doctrine thus finds robust support in these verses, while the common Muslim interpretation rests on an atomistic and contextually flawed reading.BibliographyBruce, F. F.The Gospel of John.

In many religious debates, Muslim scholars and even Jehovah’s Witnesses frequently ask: When Jesus was in the Garden of Gethsemane, whom was He praying to? And further still, they ask: Since when does God ever ask for help? Indeed, these questions require solid answers supported by clear biblical passages.To understand Jesus as God on earth praying to His Father in heaven, we must first recognize that God the Father and Jesus “the Son” had an eternal relationship long before Jesus took on human flesh. Beyond that, you must understand that when Jesus was on earth He had two natures—Jesus was fully God and at the same time fully Man (see the booklet“The Two Natures of Jesus Christ”). Please read John 5:19–27, especially verse 23, where Jesus teaches that the Father sent the Son (also see John 15:10).In Isaiah 9:6 we are told that a Son was given and a Child was born. Jesus was eternally part of the Trinity, together with the Holy Spirit. The Trinity has always been God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit—not three gods, but one God revealed in three Persons. Jesus taught that He and His Father are one (John 10:30), meaning that He and His Father share the same essence and nature. The Father, Son, and Spirit are three Persons with equal fellowship, existing together as God. These three always were and always will be in an eternal relationship. They existed before the beginning of time and will continue to exist forever and ever.When Jesus—having two natures simultaneously (God and Man) according to Isaiah 9:6—took on the sinless human body, He also took the form of a servant, giving up His heavenly glory (Philippians 2:5–11). As aMan, Jesus grew and learned obedience (Hebrews 5:8). He experienced temptation by Satan, false accusations by humans, rejection from His own people, and ultimately crucifixion. His prayers to the Father in heaven were requests for strength (John 11:41–42) and wisdom (Mark 1:35; 6:46)—ALL OF WHICH HE DIDAS A HUMAN BEING. His prayers demonstrated His dependence on His Father in His humanity so that He might fulfill the Father’s redemptive plan, as recorded in John 17. His praying showed that He ultimately submitted to the will of His Father, which included going to the cross to pay the penalty (death) for our breaking of God’s law (Matthew 26:31–46). Without question, He rose bodily from the grave, securing forgiveness and eternal life for all who repent of their sins and trust in Him as Savior.Therefore, there is no problem with God the Son praying or speaking to God the Father. As mentioned earlier, They had an eternal relationship long before Christ became man. This relationship is displayed in the Gospels so we can see how the Son of God, in His humanity, carried out the will of His Father, and in doing so, purchased redemption for His children (John 6:38). Through continually presenting Himself to His Father in heaven, Christ was always empowered and strengthened, remaining focused through His life of prayer. Christ’s example of prayer is the one we are to follow.Jesus Christ was not inferior to God while He prayed to His Father in heaven. Remember, Jesus had two natures—God and Man. He showed that even in human nature, a life of prayer is essential to accomplish the Father’s will. Jesus’ prayers to His Father demonstrated the example of relationship within the Trinity and also set an example for us: that we must depend on God for the strength and wisdom we need through prayer. Since Christ, as the God-Man, needed a vibrant prayer life, so also must His followers today.Therefore, Jesus praying to His Father—He did so as a Man (John 17), even though at the same time He was God (see the booklet“The Two Natures of Jesus Christ”). This is clear proof that since the creation of the world, there has never been anyone like Jesus Christ. Jesus is prayed TO (Acts 7:59), and at the same time we read that Jesus prays TO God the Father (John 17).Truly, Jesus Is God.For more questions, contact us atmaxshimbaministries@gmail.comPresented to you byMax ShimbaFrom Max Shimba Ministries Org.© 2015, AprilApril 09, 2015",

    "full_content": "Saturday, November 2, 2013THE QURAN ADMITS THAT ISLAM IS A RELIGION FOR ARABS ONLYIn this article, I present evidence that Islam is a religion meant exclusively for Arabs.Muslims, without rest, have consistently claimed that Islam will one day rule the entire world. However, in doing so, they contradict the words of Allah as revealed in the Qur’an. Therefore, it is fair to say that they are unbelievers (kafirs).Qur’an 10:47–\"And for every nation there is a messenger. When their messenger comes, judgment is made between them with justice, and they are not wronged.\"Now look at this verse as well:Qur’an 14:4–\"And We did not send any messenger except [speaking] in the language of his people to state clearly for them, and Allah sends astray whom He wills and guides whom He wills. And He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.\"If these verses are true, then Islam is not for nations or communities that are not Arab. The Qur’an states that every people has received a message from God in their own language so they may understand it. The Qur’an was revealed in Arabic so that the Arabs would understand what Allah was saying.This concept of Allah sending down a book in each people's language is crucial and is repeated often. It is foundational to this discussion.Qur’an 16:36–\"And We certainly sent into every nation a messenger, [saying], 'Worship Allah and avoid Taghut (false gods).' And among them were those whom Allah guided, and among them were those upon whom misguidance was [deservedly] decreed. So travel through the earth and observe how was the end of the deniers.\"Qur’an 5:48–\"And We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad], the Book in truth, confirming that which preceded it of the Scripture and as a criterion over it. So judge between them by what Allah has revealed and do not follow their inclinations away from what has come to you of the truth. To each of you We prescribed a law and a method. Had Allah willed, He would have made you one nation [united in religion], but [He intended] to test you in what He has given you; so race to [all that is] good. To Allah is your return all together, and He will [then] inform you concerning that over which you used to differ.\"Qur’an 36:5-6–\"A revelation of the Exalted in Might, the Merciful. That you may warn a people whose forefathers were not warned, so they are unaware.\"These verses are complete and clearly explain that the message came specifically for the Arabs. Allah in the Qur’an says that every people has had their own prophet sent to them to warn them in their own language, and that He sent Muhammad to those who had not yet received guidance and whose ancestors had not been warned—that is, the Arabs. In this way, they would have no excuse to say they never received any message.Continue reading in the Qur’an:Qur’an 6:156–\"Lest you say, 'The Scripture was only sent down to two groups before us, but we were unaware of their teachings.'\"Qur’an 6:157–\"Or lest you say, 'If only the Scripture had been revealed to us, we would have been better guided than they.' So there has [now] come to you a clear evidence from your Lord and a guidance and mercy. Then who is more unjust than one who denies the verses of Allah and turns away from them? We will recompense those who turn away from Our verses with the worst of punishment for their having turned away.\"The Qur’an clearly states that it was revealed to the Arabs. Those who are not Arabs cannot understand the Qur’an—those are Allah's words. Muslims insist that no translation of the Qur’an can be accurate. Therefore, the Qur’an can never be made fully understandable to non-Arab nations or communities and was not sent for them.Another proof that the Qur’an was revealed only for Arabs is found in the following verses:Qur’an 26:198-199–\"And if We had revealed it to one among the non-Arabs, and he had recited it to them, they would still not have believed in it.\"Just as Arabs have the right not to believe in any book that was not revealed in their language—meaning Arabic—non-Arab communities equally have the right not to believe in the Qur’an, a book written in Arabic. That is why the Qur’an says that Allah will send a messenger for every language so that the people can understand him for themselves.To make sure there is no misunderstanding, Allah gives this verse:Qur’an 5:19–\"O People of the Book! Our Messenger has indeed come to you, making things clear to you after an interval without messengers, lest you say, 'There came to us no bringer of good tidings and no warner.' But now there has come to you a bringer of good tidings and a warner. And Allah is Most Capable of all things.\"According to the Qur’an, all people have received revelation. The above verse says the Qur’an was sent to those who had never received revelation before, so they could not say, “We never received a prophet or a warner.”This matter is very clear, but Allah wants it to be clear even to someone with no understanding. That’s why He specifies the actual geographical locations to which Muhammad was sent as a prophet of Allah.Qur’an 6:92–\"And this is a blessed Book which We have revealed, confirming what was before it, that you may warn the Mother of Cities (Mecca) and those around it. Those who believe in the Hereafter believe in it, and they are maintaining their prayers.\"Today, we have learned that the Qur’an was sent only for the Arabs and not for all nations. Now, I’m sure some Muslims will bring other verses that claim Islam is for all mankind. If Muslims do so, then they must acknowledge that those verses contradict the ones above.Therefore, either the Qur’an is a bundle of contradictions and falsehoods, or it is only for the Arabs of Mecca and its surroundings, just as Allah—the god of Muslims—says.In His service,Dr. Maxwell ShimbaCopyright © Max Shimba Ministries 2013",

Hii inafanya iendane na viwango vya uchapishaji wa kisomi.Ukristo ni Bora Kuliko UislamuNa: Dr. Maxwell Shimba1. UtanguliziUkristo na Uislamu mara nyingi hutajwa kama dini mbili kuu za Kimonotheisti (zinazomwamini Mungu mmoja). Hata hivyo, uchambuzi wa kina wa maandiko ya msingi, historia, na theolojia zao unaonyesha tofauti kubwa zinazoweka Ukristo juu kuliko Uislamu. Biblia ni mkusanyiko wa maandiko yaliyohifadhiwa kwa karne nyingi, yaliyoandikwa kati ya karne ya 15 K.K. hadi karne ya kwanza B.K., wakati Qur’an iliibuka karne ya 7 B.K., karne nyingi baadaye.12. Yesu Kristo na Utimilifu wa UnabiiYesu Kristo ndiye kiini cha Ukristo. Alitabiriwa na manabii wa Agano la Kale (Isaya 7:14; Mika 5:2), na maisha yake yameandikwa na mashahidi wa macho katika Injili. Hata wanahistoria wasio Wakristo kamaFlavius Josephus(Antiquities of the Jews, 18.3.3) naTacitus(Annals, 15.44) walithibitisha kuwepo kwa Yesu na kifo chake chini ya Pontio Pilato.2Qur’an yenyewe inakiri kuzaliwa kwa muujiza kwa Yesu (Qur’an 3:45-47).3. Uhakika wa Maandiko ya BibliaBiblia inajulikana kwa uhifadhi wake wa kipekee.Dead Sea Scrolls(karne ya 2 K.K.–1 B.K.) ziligunduliwa mwaka 1947 na kuthibitisha uaminifu wa maandiko ya Agano la Kale yaliyopo sasa.3Biblia yenyewe inashuhudia kudumu kwake:“Majani yakauka, ua likanyauka; bali neno la Mungu wetu litadumu milele”(Isaya 40:8). Qur’an pia inakubali uhalali wa Taurati na Injili (Qur’an 5:46).4. Upendo wa Mungu na Uhakika wa WokovuMsingi wa Ukristo ni upendo wa Mungu:“Kwa maana jinsi hii Mungu aliupenda ulimwengu, hata akamtoa Mwana wake pekee”(Yohana 3:16). Wokovu unatolewa bure kupitia imani (Waefeso 2:8-9). Kwa upande mwingine, Uislamu unaweka msisitizo juu ya matendo na utiifu wa sharia, bila uhakika wa wokovu (Qur’an 45:28).5. Kifo na Ufufuo wa Yesu: Ushahidi KihistoriaUkristo unasimama juu ya kifo na ufufuo wa Yesu. Mtume Paulo anaeleza:“Kristo alikufa kwa ajili ya dhambi zetu… akazikwa, akafufuka siku ya tatu”(1 Wakorintho 15:3-4). Ushahidi wa kaburi tupu na mashahidi wa macho ni wa kihistoria. Hata wanahistoria wa Kiyahudi na Warumi walithibitisha tukio hili.4Qur’an (Sura 4:157) inakataa msalaba, lakini ushahidi wa kihistoria na wa kimaandiko unapingana na madai hayo.6. Mifano ya Kihistoria ya Karne za KatiHistoria inathibitisha tofauti kati ya dini hizi mbili:Katika Ukristo, vyuo vikuu vya kwanza Ulaya (Oxford, Cambridge, Sorbonne) vilianzishwa kutokana na hamu ya kutafuta maarifa ya Mungu.5Wanasayansi kamaGalileo Galilei,Johannes Kepler, naIsaac Newtonwaliongozwa na imani ya Kikristo kwamba ulimwengu una mpangilio wa Kimungu.Katika Uislamu, upanuzi mkubwa ulifanyika kupitiavita vya jihadi. Waarabu walivamia Afrika Kaskazini, Mashariki ya Kati, na Uhispania. Wakristo wa Hispania waliishi chini ya utawala wa Kiislamu hadiReconquista(1492).67. Tofauti ya TheolojiaTofauti ya msingi iko wazi: Mungu wa Biblia ni Mungu wa upendo na wokovu, wakati Qur’an inamchora Allah kama mtawala mkali asiye na uhakika wa kutoa wokovu. Yohane 8:36 inasema:“Basi Mwana atakapowaweka huru, mtakuwa huru kweli kweli.”Qur’an 5:68 inakiri kuwa Wayahudi na Wakristo lazima washikamane na Taurati na Injili, lakini Waislamu wanakana. Hii inaleta kile kinachoitwa “Dilema ya Kiislamu.”78. HitimishoUlinganisho wa kihistoria na kimaandiko unaonyesha wazi kwamba Ukristo ni bora kuliko Uislamu. Biblia ina ushahidi wa kihistoria, upendo wa Mungu, unabii ulio timilika, na uhakika wa wokovu. Uislamu una misingi dhaifu ya kihistoria, unakanusha ukweli wa kifo cha Yesu na hutegemea matendo bila neema. Qur’an yenyewe inasema:“Neno la Mungu haliwezi kubadilishwa”(Qur’an 10:64). Kwa hivyo, Biblia inabaki kuwa Neno la Mungu lisiloharibika, na Ukristo unathibitisha ukuu wake juu ya Uislamu.Maelezo ya ChiniMarejeoBiblia TakatifuQur’an Tukufu (tafsiri ya Yusuf Ali na Pickthall)Vitabu vya kihistoria vilivyotajwa hapo juuJe ungependa nifanyemuundo wa kitabu (chapters + subchapters)ili makala hii iwe sehemu ya kitabu kipya chako cha apologetics, au iendelee kubaki kama makala ya kitaaluma ya kujitegemea?FootnotesPhilip Jenkins,The Lost History of Christianity(HarperOne, 2008), uk. 34.↩Flavius Josephus,Antiquities of the Jews, 18.3.3; Tacitus,Annals, 15.44.↩Geza Vermes,The Complete Dead Sea Scrolls in English(Penguin, 2011).↩Gary Habermas & Michael Licona,The Case for the Resurrection of Jesus(Kregel, 2004).↩Hastings Rashdall,The Universities of Europe in the Middle Ages(Oxford, 1895).↩Thomas F.

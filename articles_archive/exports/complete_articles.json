    "full_content": "Abraham Never Built the Kaʿbah — A Scholarly ExaminationBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba — Shimba Theological InstituteAbstract (short).This article examines the widely held Islamic tradition that Abraham (Ibrāhīm) and his son Ismāʿīl built the Kaʿbah in Mecca, and it evaluates six assertions commonly made in Christian critiques: (1) Abraham never visited Mecca; (2) Abraham did not build the Black Stone nor did it fall from the sky in the manner commonly described in later tradition; (3) Abraham made altars opposite a sacred stone but not the Kaʿbah as known in Islamic tradition; (4) the “Valley of Baca” (Psa lm 84) is not identical with Bakka/Makkah; (5) the “pilgrimage” language in Psalm 84 is not a reference to Hajj at the Kaʿbah; and (6) the well where Hagar found water in Genesis is not necessarily the Zamzam of Mecca. The evidence shows that the Abraham–Kaʿbah connection is a powerful and ancienttraditionwithin Islam, but it is not independently attested by contemporary extra-Qurʾānic sources or archaeology in a way that would confirm the historicist claims made in later communal memory. Where the sources are ambiguous or interpretive, this paper exposes the contested nature of the identifications and recommends careful, cautious conclusions.IntroductionMuslim tradition presents the Kaʿbah as the primeval “House” associated with Adam and later rebuilt by Abraham and Ismāʿīl (Qurʾānic formulation: “when Abraham and Ismail raised the foundations of the House…”). This narrative is doctrinally central within Islam and embedded in ritual memory (tawāf, Hajj rites, the place of Maqām Ibrāhīm, Zamzam, the Black Stone). Yet from the perspective of historical-critical inquiry, the claim that Abraham physically visited Mecca and (re)constructed the Kaʿbah in the Hejaz requires external corroboration — textual, epigraphic, or archaeological — which is thin or absent. The following sections analyse the evidence and alternative readings.1. Tradition versus independent historical evidenceClaim.Abraham never visited Mecca (no independent historical evidence he did).Evidence & argument.The Qurʾān and Islamic tradition clearly attribute the raising/rebuilding of the Kaʿbah to Abraham and Ismāʿīl; however, secular historical and archaeological surveys note the paucity of contemporaneous (e.g., Near Eastern, Byzantine, or South Arabian) records that tie Abraham — a patriarchal figure of the second/third millennium BCE in Biblical chronology — to the Hejaz sanctuary. Modern reference works summarise both the Islamic tradition and the relative lack of independent evidence for a pre-Islamic Kaʿbah founded by Abraham in the exact form described by later Muslim exegesis.Encyclopedia Britannica+1Conclusion:The Abrahamic origin of the Kaʿbah is a theological/traditional claim with strong internal attestation in Islamic literature; it lacks external, datable archaeological corroboration that would demonstrate a historical, physical act by Abraham in Mecca.2. The Black Stone: tradition, later legend, and uncertain originClaim.Abraham never built the Black Stone from the sky; origin stories vary and are not historically verifiable.Evidence & argument.Islamic tradition recounts several origins for the Black Stone (al-Hajar al-Aswad): meteorite, relic from Adam, an angel turned to stone, etc. Medieval and later writers record these traditions, and modern commentators add geological speculation (some propose meteoritic origin). However, the stone has never been subjected to definitive modern scientific analysis (for obvious religious and political reasons), and scholarly treatments emphasise that accounts of celestial origin are traditions, not scientific proof.Wikipedia+1Conclusion:The Black Stone’s “from the sky” narrative belongs to devotional tradition and later apologetic exegesis; it cannot be treated as a historically established fact without independent physical analysis and corroboration.3. Abraham’s altars and the possibility of ritual sites distinct from the KaʿbahClaim.Abraham built altars to offer sacrifices opposite a stone, but this should not be conflated automatically with the later Kaʿbah structure in Mecca.Evidence & argument.Islamic exegetical tradition sometimes locates early patriarchal sanctities (altars, stations of prayer) within a broader sacred geography attributed to Abraham. Early texts and later tafsīr narrate that Abraham found the Black Stone and (re)established a sanctuary; yet these retellings function to sacralise the Meccan shrine and properly integrate it into Abrahamic lineage. From the historian’s viewpoint, such narrative moves are common in religious traditions that link local shrines to revered ancestors. Comparative scholarship treats such reports as theological legitimations rather than independent chronicles of construction works.Encyclopedia Britannica+1Conclusion:References to altars and sacrifices associated with Abraham are important for devotional history but do not demonstrate a straightforward archaeological claim that ties Abraham physically to the extant Kaʿbah complex.4. The Valley of Baca (Baka/Bakkah) — biblical text and identificationsClaim.The valley of Baca in Psalm 84 is not (demonstrably) the Valley of Mecca/Bakkah.Evidence & argument.Psalm 84 (a pilgrimage psalm) uses the Hebrew termBaca(בכא/“baká( )”/“weeping” or “balsam”), typically understood in Jewish and Christian exegesis as a local valley in or near ancient Israel (possible identifications include the Valley of Rephaim or others). Islamic interpreters read the QurʾānicBakkah(Q 3:96) as Mecca and some Muslim exegetes connect Psalmic language to Mecca retrospectively. Secular and revisionist scholars (e.g., Tom Holland; and various source-critical authors) point out that the HebrewBakhaand ArabicBakkahare separate lexical items and that identification of the Psalm’s valley with Mecca is not linguistically or historically compelled. The scholarly literature therefore treats the identification as speculative, often motivated by theological correlation rather than direct evidence.Bible Hub+1Conclusion:Psalm 84’s “Valley of Baca” is best read in its immediate canonical and Israelite setting; linking it to Mecca requires assumptions that go beyond the biblical text and into comparative theological reading.5. Psalm 84 and the idea of “pilgrimage” — not HajjClaim.The pilgrimage language in Psalm 84 is not description of the Islamic Hajj to the Kaʿbah.Evidence & argument.Psalm 84 is part of the Israelite pilgrimage/temple psalmody tradition (pilgrimage to Zion, the Temple). Its language — “blessed are those who dwell in your house… they journey from strength to strength” — is framed by Israelite cultic practice and geography (Jerusalem/Zion). While some modern readers attempt to read Psalm 84 typologically vis-à-vis later pilgrimage forms (including Hajj), the historical context and the Israelite cultic horizon make a direct identification with Hajj or the Kaʿbah anachronistic.Explore the Bible+1Conclusion:The Psalm is best explained within Israelite cultic-pilgrimage imagination; equating it to Hajj represents a theological reading, not an exegesis grounded in the Psalm’s own historical setting.6. Hagar, Ishmael, and the water: Zamzam vs. Genesis wellsClaim.The water associated with Hagar in Genesis is not necessarily the Zamzam well of Mecca.Evidence & argument.Genesis 21:14–21 recounts Hagar and Ishmael in the wilderness, God opening a well (Hebrewmiqweh/ma‘in), and their survival. Islamic tradition locates a parallel event at Mecca (Zamzam), and later Islamic historiography identifies the site and ritualises Safa–Marwah and the well. The narratives have similar motifs (divine water for the abandoned child), but the Genesis narrative is set in the Negev/Beersheba or surrounding region (patriarchal south of Canaan), and there is no explicit biblical geography of Mecca. The tradition that equates the Genesis well with Zamzam is thus an inter-religious identification that post-dates the biblical text and belongs to the Islamic sacred-historical mapping of Abrahamic memory onto the Hejaz.Wikipedia+1Conclusion:The shared motifs do not by themselves prove identity of locations; the Genesis text does not mention Mecca or Zamzam.7. Summary and balanced assessmentStrong internal tradition.Islamic texts (Qurʾān and hadīth corpus; classical tafsīr) and continuous devotional practice robustly affirm Abraham’s role vis-à-vis the Kaʿbah, the Black Stone, Zamzam, and the sanctity of Makkah/Bakkah. This is the baseline of Muslim belief and community memory.Encyclopedia Britannica+1Lack of independent, contemporary corroboration.From a historical-critical vantage point, there is no external contemporaneous record (Near Eastern inscriptions, Byzantine or South Arabian records) that corroborates in detail an act of Abrahamian construction in the Hejaz; archaeological evidence for a continuous, datable structure back to the patriarchal era is not available. Scholarly literature accordingly distinguishes tradition from verifiable history.Oxford Bibliographies+1Textual-linguistic caution.The HebrewBaca/Bakhaand ArabicBakkahare similar-looking to modern readers but have distinct philological histories; mapping Psalmic valleys to Mecca requires methodological caution and additional positive evidence.Wikipedia+1Tradition as identity-forming narrative.The Abraham–Kaʿbah tradition is a powerful identity and legitimating narrative. Its religious force is real even where extra-Islamic historical verification is not forthcoming. Recognising this helps explain why the tradition persists and is authoritative for Muslims even in the absence of corroborating archaeological data.Annex — Selected verses and texts (for reference)QurʾānSurah 3 (Āl-ʿImrān) : 96— “Verily, the first House (of worship) appointed for mankind was that at Bakkah (Makkah), full of blessing, and a guidance for mankind.” (common translations).My IslamQurʾān 2:127— “And when Abraham and Ishmael were raising the foundations of the House…” (translations vary: “raised the foundations” / “set up the House”).Encyclopedia BritannicaHebrew Bible / Old TestamentPsalm 84:5–6— “Blessed are those whose strength is in you, in whose heart are the highways to Zion.

The evidence above shows that: (a) the Abraham–Kaʿbah tradition is authoritative within Islamic historiography and ritual; (b) it is not matched by contemporaneous extra-Qurʾānic documentation or unambiguous archaeological proof; and (c) several identifications (Valley of Baca → Mecca; Genesis well → Zamzam) are interpretive overlays rather than necessary textual conclusions.

    "full_content": "A Scholarly Debate on Ishmael’s Lineage and the Ethnic Origins of MuhammadBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThe Islamic tradition holds that the Prophet Muhammad is a direct descendant of Ishmael, the son of Abraham and Hagar. This genealogical claim is foundational to Islamic identity, as it connects Muhammad—and therefore Islam—to the Abrahamic covenantal line. However, when examined through both scriptural and historical lenses, this claim raises several inconsistencies. A critical question arises:if Ishmael’s mother was Egyptian and his wife was also Egyptian, does this not imply that his descendants—if traceable—would be African rather than Arabian?This academic inquiry aims to provoke a theological and historical debate by juxtaposing the biblical narrative with Islamic claims. The purpose is not to diminish faith but to invite reasoned dialogue rooted in textual integrity and historical truth.1. The Biblical Account: Ishmael’s African ConnectionAccording toGenesis 16:1–12andGenesis 21:9–21, Hagar, the mother of Ishmael, was an Egyptian handmaiden of Sarah. Later, asGenesis 21:21records, Hagar took a wife for Ishmaelfrom the land of Egypt. This means Ishmael was the child of an Egyptian mother and married an Egyptian woman—making both his maternal and marital lines African in origin.Rabbinic commentary inGenesis Rabbah 53:15reinforces this by citing the proverb:“Throw a stick into the air, and it will always fall on its end.”In context, this saying means that Hagar, being Egyptian, naturally chose an Egyptian wife for her son.Thus, if Ishmael’s lineage continued biologically,his offspring would have carried Egyptian (African) blood.2. The Islamic Claim: Muhammad as a Descendant of IshmaelIslamic tradition asserts that Muhammad descended from Ishmael through his sonKedar(Qidar). This claim, however, lacks direct historical documentation before Islam emerged in the 7th century CE. There existsno continuous genealogical recordlinking Ishmael to Muhammad. The genealogy is largely retrospective—constructed after Muhammad’s lifetime to affirm his prophetic legitimacy within the Abrahamic line.Critical Questions:Where is the documented genealogical chain from Ishmael to Muhammad found before the 7th century?How can Ishmael’s African lineage be reconciled with the claim that Muhammad was purely Arab?If Arabs claim descent from Ishmael, does this not also imply that they share African ancestry through Hagar?Why do many Muslims reject any notion that Muhammad could have had African blood when their own tradition connects Ishmael to Egypt?3. Historical and Ethnological AnalysisThe termEgyptianin the biblical sense refers to people ofNorth African descent, part of the Hamitic line (Genesis 10:6). Therefore, Ishmael’s genealogy is partly Hamitic through Hagar and his Egyptian wife, and partly Semitic through Abraham. Any claim of pure Semitic descent through Ishmael ignores this dual heritage.Furthermore, ancient Arab tribes such as theQedariteswere nomadic groups in northwestern Arabia, but their ethnic composition was not uniform. Archaeological and linguistic evidence suggests significant African influence and intermarriage in those regions.If we accept the Islamic claim that Muhammad descended from Ishmael,logic dictates that Muhammad’s ancestry was at least partially African.Yet, this conclusion is often rejected in Islamic discourse, revealing a contradiction between faith-based genealogy and ethnological reality.4. The Debate: A Call for ConsistencyMuslims must face one of two possibilities:If Muhammad is indeed a descendant of Ishmael, then by scriptural and historical reasoning, he carried African (Egyptian) blood.If Muhammad was not African, then the claim that he descended from Ishmael collapses, since Ishmael’s lineage is inextricably tied to Egypt.Therefore, the question remains:“Can Islam uphold Muhammad’s Ishmaelite heritage without acknowledging his African ancestry?”If not, then perhaps the genealogical claim itself was theological rather than historical—a symbolic link to Abraham to grant Muhammad prophetic legitimacy.5. Scholarly ConclusionThis debate exposes a fundamental tension in Islamic historiography: the desire to connect Muhammad to Abraham through Ishmael, while distancing him from Africa through Hagar.But the biblical record is unambiguous—Hagar and Ishmael’s line began in Egypt.Hence, the argument concludes:Either Muhammad was an African by descent through Ishmael,Or he hadno genealogical connection to Ishmael at all.Until verifiable historical evidence bridges this 2,500-year genealogical gap, the claim remainsa theological assertion rather than a historical fact.Final Provocative Question:If Islam insists on an Abrahamic lineage through Ishmael, will it also embrace the African heritage inherent in that lineage—or continue to deny it in pursuit of an Arabized identity?By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

The narration reports that animals and trees prostrated before Muhammad, implying an act of worship. The Companions, amazed by this act, suggested that they too should prostrate before him. This Hadith raises deep theological questions about the nature of worship, the distinction between servitude to God and reverence for a human, and the boundaries of Islamic monotheism (tawḥīd). The paper seeks to evaluate the theological, logical, and Qur’anic inconsistencies that emerge from this narration.The Quoted HadithAl-Tirmidhi, Hadith 3270— Narrated by Aisha:\"Once when Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) was with a number of the Emigrants and Helpers, a camel came and prostrated itself before him. Thereupon his Companions said, ‘Messenger of Allah, beasts and trees prostrate themselves before you, but we have the greatest right to do so.’ He replied, ‘Worship your Lord and honor your brother. If I were to order anyone to prostrate himself before another, I should order a woman to prostrate herself before her husband. If he were to order her to convey stones from a yellow mountain to a black one, or from a black mountain to a white one, it would be incumbent on her to do so.’\"(Transmitted by Ahmad and al-Tirmidhi)Theological and Logical InquiryAisha’s narration introduces profound theological implications that challenge Islamic monotheism (Tawḥīd al-ʿUlūhiyyah). The fact that animals and trees allegedlyprostrated before Muhammadimplies an act of reverence reserved for divine beings. In Islam,sujūd(prostration) is a distinct form of worship that belongs exclusively to Allah (Surah 41:37; 22:18). Thus, if non-human creation performed this before Muhammad, several critical questions arise:Did the animals and trees commit shirk (idolatry)?According toSurah al-Anbiyāʾ 21:98–99,“Indeed, you and what you worship besides Allah are the fuel of Hell. You will surely enter it. If those had truly been gods, they would not have entered it, but all will abide therein forever.”This verse condemns all beings that are worshipped besides Allah. If animals and trees prostrated before Muhammad, does this not make him the object of their worship?Why did Allah allow this to occur?If Muhammad is truly a mere messenger (rasūl), how does divine permission extend to acts of prostration toward him by creation? Is this not in contradiction withSurah 41:37which states,“Do not prostrate to the sun or to the moon, but prostrate to Allah who created them.”Was Aisha mistaken or fabricating?As the Prophet’s wife, Aisha’s report holds significant authority in Islamic tradition. However, if the Hadith implies the Prophet accepted worship (even passively), it undermines the Qur’anic command inSurah 18:110:“Say, I am only a human being like you, to whom it has been revealed that your God is one God.”If Aisha’s account is authentic, then it portrays Muhammad in a position of divinity rather than prophethood.Exegetical Tension: Worship vs. HonorThe Prophet’s response—“Worship your Lord and honor your brother”—appears to distance himself from direct worship. Yet, the narrative fails to address why the camel and trees were permitted to perform prostration. The Companions’ statement,“Beasts and trees prostrate before you, but we have the greatest right to do so,”reveals that even early Muslims perceived this as an act ofveneration, if not worship.This suggests an early tendency towardprophetic exaltation, later seen inShama’il al-Muhammadiyyahand Sufi traditions where Muhammad is described as the “Light of Creation” (Nūr Muḥammadī). The narrative, therefore, exposes an evolving theology that blurs the line between devotion to Allah and reverence for His messenger.Philosophical and Theological ImplicationsFrom a theological standpoint, the Hadith leads to a paradox:If the beasts and trees truly worshipped Muhammad,shirkwas committed.If they did not, the Hadith contradicts its own narrative, rendering itmythological or metaphorical.Either outcome undermines the integrity of Hadith transmission or Islamic theology of pure monotheism.Furthermore, this account echoesancient pagan reverencewhere nature worshipped semi-divine heroes and kings—suggesting the possiblesyncretic incorporationof earlier cultural myths into Hadith literature.ConclusionThe Hadith of Aisha (al-Tirmidhi 3270) remains a profound theological problem within Islamic orthodoxy. It implies that Muhammad received a form of worship from creation, contradicting the Qur’an’s uncompromising monotheism. Whether this account is allegorical or literal, it exposes atension between prophetic humanity and divine exaltationin early Islamic narratives. The narration attributed to Aisha thus becomes a critical text for examiningthe evolution of Muhammad’s deificationin post-Qur’anic traditions.BibliographyAl-Tirmidhi, Abu Isa Muhammad ibn Isa.Jamiʿ al-Tirmidhi, Hadith 3270.Ahmad ibn Hanbal.Musnad Ahmad, Vol. 6, Hadith No. 25512.The Qur’an, Surah 18:110; 21:98–99; 22:18; 41:37.Ibn Kathir, Ismail.Tafsir al-Qur’an al-Azim.Dar al-Fikr, Beirut, 1998.Al-Bukhari, Muhammad ibn Ismail.Sahih al-Bukhari.Crone, Patricia.Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam.Princeton University Press, 1987.Wansbrough, John.Quranic Studies: Sources and Methods of Scriptural Interpretation.Oxford University Press, 1977.Shimba, Maxwell.Theological Paradoxes in Islamic Texts: A Comparative Inquiry.Shimba Theological Institute Press, 2025.",

    "full_content": "Divine Uncertainty in Qur’an 47:28: A Theological Inquiry into Allah’s “Installation”By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis article investigates the peculiar expression inQur’an 47:28, where Allah is portrayed as “installing” or “setting” (imlāʾ) something within the disbelievers, which raises profound questions about divine certainty, omniscience, and intentionality in the Qur’anic text. The study employs comparative theological analysis, hermeneutical exegesis, and linguistic critique to uncover whether the verse implies divine uncertainty or a reactive, rather than sovereign, mode of action in Allah’s dealings with human beings.1. Introduction: The Problem of Divine Intention in Qur’an 47:28Qur’an 47:28 states:“That is because they followed what angered Allah and disliked what pleased Him, so He made their deeds fruitless.”(Qur’an 47:28, Sahih International)However, several classical and modern translations also render key verbs in ways that suggestinstallation,deliberate placement, orallowance— terms which carry semantic connotations of gradual process, testing, or even hesitation. The Arabic phrasefa-ahbaṭa a‘mālahum(“so He made their deeds fruitless”) and related interpretive commentaries imply an intervention that occursafter observation, not by predetermined decree.This raises critical theological questions:If Allah’s omniscience is perfect, why must He “install” or “set” reactions after observing human choices?Does this imply that Allah’s judgment is contingent upon unfolding events?How can an all-knowing deity “test” what He already knows with absolute certainty?2. Linguistic and Exegetical Analysis of “Installation” (إملاء)The Arabic termimlāʾ(from the rootm-l-y) occurs in several Qur’anic passages (e.g., 3:178; 7:183), often translated as “granting respite,” “installing,” or “allowing delay.” This verb is sometimes used to describe Allah’s extended patience toward sinners before punishment.Yet, the morphology of the word suggestsprocessrather thanfinality. It depicts a deity who acts through stages, waiting, observing, and then implementing outcomes based on human response.In classicaltafsīrworks (e.g.,Tafsir al-Tabari,Tafsir al-Qurtubi), scholars attempted to reconcile this with Allah’s omniscience by claiming thatimlāʾrefers to divine testing (ibtilāʾ). However, testing presupposes uncertainty about the test’s result — a philosophical contradiction to omniscience.This invites deeper inquiry:Why does Allah “grant time” or “install” disbelief rather than instantaneously decreeing it?Doesimlāʾreflect a temporal learning process within Allah’s actions?Can a timeless being operate within temporal delay?3. Theological Implications: Is Allah Reactive or Proactive?The Qur’an often portrays Allah asreactingto human behavior: rewarding faith, cursing disbelief, or altering decrees based on obedience (Qur’an 13:39; 8:53). InQur’an 47:28, this reactive tendency is evident — Allah responds to their dislike of what pleases Him by nullifying their deeds.In contrast, the Biblical God declares,“I am the Lord, I change not”(Malachi 3:6) and“Known unto God are all His works from the beginning of the world”(Acts 15:18). The Biblical framework depicts omniscience as an eternal constancy, not adaptive reaction.Hence, the question arises:Does the Qur’an’s Allah act sequentially, responding to events as they occur?If so, can divine knowledge in Islam be truly eternal and unchanging?Does Allah’s “installation” of delay suggest dependence on human decision-making to complete His will?4. The Problem of Divine Psychology: Is Allah Testing Himself?If Allah’s “installation” implies that He must observe before judging, this introduces a divine cognitive process resemblinghuman reasoning. This anthropomorphic depiction contradicts the classical Islamic doctrine oftanzīh(absolute transcendence), which asserts that Allah is beyond time, space, and human emotion.Yet, Qur’an 47:28 and related verses describe Allah as being angered, pleased, or testing believers. Such human-like emotions raise theological tension:Can an immutable being become “angry” or “pleased”?Is Allah’s decision-making process an evolving response rather than a predetermined decree?If Allah installs disbelief or guidance progressively, is He learning from human actions?5. Comparative Reflection: Divine Certainty in the Bible vs. Qur’anIn the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures, God’s foreknowledge precedes creation itself (Isaiah 46:10; Romans 8:29). There is no notion of divine installation or delay because God’s decrees are absolute, not observational.By contrast, the Qur’anic Allah’s behavior appears inconsistent with omniscient sovereignty. He “tests” to know (Qur’an 47:31), “changes” decrees (Qur’an 13:39), and “installs” or “grants time” (Qur’an 47:28; 3:178).Thus, the philosophical debate centers on whether the Qur’anic portrayal of Allah reflectsepistemic limitation— an unfolding divine consciousness tied to time and human action — or whether these are merely metaphors misunderstood by interpreters.6. Conclusion: A Call for Re-examining Qur’anic TheismQur’an 47:28 exposes deep theological ambiguity. The “installation” language challenges the coherence of Allah’s omniscience, sovereignty, and immutability. The Qur’an’s God appears to operate within temporal frameworks, responding to human choices rather than governing from eternal certainty.This invites broader philosophical and theological questions:If Allah must install, test, or wait, can He be truly omniscient?Is the Qur’an’s deity engaged in temporal trial and error?Does this reveal an evolving concept of God in early Islamic theology?Or does it point to a fundamentally human authorship behind the Qur’an, reflecting psychological projection rather than divine omniscience?ReferencesThe Qur’an, Surah 47:28, 3:178, 7:183, 13:39, 8:53, 47:31.Al-Tabari,Jāmiʿ al-Bayān ʿan Taʾwīl Āy al-Qurʾān.Al-Qurtubi,Al-Jāmiʿ li-Aḥkām al-Qurʾān.Ibn Kathir,Tafsir al-Qur’an al-ʿAzim.Cragg, Kenneth.The Event of the Qur’an: Islam in Its Scripture.

    "full_content": "Jumamosi, Septemba 24, 2016​ALLAH ALITEREMSHA AYA NA KUELEZA KUWA SINAGOGI SIO MISIKITIHili ni jambo la kushangaza na pigo kubwa kwa Uislamu wote duniani. Ndiyo maana nalisema wazi kuwa hii nimsumari wa mwisho kwenye jeneza la Uislamu.KatikaSuratul Hajj, Aya ya 40, Qur’an yenyewe inatamka kwa uwazi kuhusu aina mbalimbali za majengo ya ibada. Imeorodhesha “nyumba za watawa,” “makanisa,” “masinagogi,” na “misikiti.” Swali la msingi na la kufikirisha ni hili:Kama kweli Sinagogi ni sawa na Misikiti, kwa nini Qur’an inavitofautisha kwa majina na kuyaweka kama taasisi tofauti?Aya inasema:“Wale ambao wametolewa majumbani mwao pasipo haki, ila kwa kuwa wanasema: Mola wetu Mlezi ni Mwenyezi Mungu! Na lau kuwa Mwenyezi Mungu hawakingi watu kwa watu, basi hapana shaka zingelivunjwa nyumba za wat’awa, na makanisa, na masinagogi, na misikiti, ambamo ndani yake jina la Mwenyezi Mungu linatajwa kwa wingi. Na bila shaka Mwenyezi Mungu humsaidia yule anayemsaidia Yeye. Hakika Mwenyezi Mungu ni Mwenye Nguvu, Mtukufu.”(Suratul Hajj: 40)Tafakari kwa makini maneno haya:Nyumba za watawa– Hizi ni sehemu ambazo watawa wa Kikristo walijitenga kwa maombi na ibada.Makanisa– Majengo ya Wakristo yaliyotengwa mahsusi kwa ajili ya ibada ya Mungu.Masinagogi– Nyumba za ibada za Wayahudi, ambako Torati ilisomwa na jina la Mungu wa Israeli likatajwa.Misikiti– Hapa ndipo Waislamu walipokusanyika kwa ibada zao.Kwa nini Qur’an isiunganishe yote haya kama kitu kimoja kama kweli ni ibada ya Mungu mmoja? Ikiwa Sinagogi na Msikiti ni kitu kimoja, basi uorodheshaji huu ungekuwa wa kurudia rudia tu, jambo ambalo lingeharibu hata ufasaha wa maandiko.Hii inafunua mambo makubwa mawili:Kwanza, Qur’an inakiri kwa uwazi kwamba kabla ya Muhammad, tayari kulikuwepo na nyumba nyingi za ibada zinazotofautiana – Wayahudi na Wakristo walishamjua Mungu na walishamwabudu kwa karne nyingi kupitia Sinagogi na Makanisa.Pili, aya hii inaweka wazi kwamba Misikiti ni taasisi mpya iliyoibuka tu baada ya Muhammad. Hii inaondoa madai ya Waislamu kwamba Uislamu ulikuwepo tangu zama za Nabii Ibrahim au kwamba dini zote za awali zilikuwa na “Uislamu.” Kama ingekuwa hivyo, basi Sinagogi zingetajwa kama Misikiti na Makanisa yangetambuliwa pia kama Misikiti.Kwa hiyo, Qur’an inajichanganya yenyewe. Inapojaribu kuhalalisha nafasi ya Uislamu, kwa bahati mbaya inakiri bila kujua kwamba dini za awali – Uyahudi na Ukristo – zilikuwa na utambulisho wao wa kipekee na wa kweli wa ibada.Ukweli huu unathibitisha hoja yangu ya msingi:Uislamu ni mfumo ulioanzishwa na Muhammad karne ya 7 BK, na haukuwapo kabla yake.Ni dini ya kubuni yenye mkanganyiko, iliyoundwa ili kupinga na kuiga mafundisho ya Biblia.Kwa hiyo, swali kwa kila Msomaji Mwislamu ni hili:Kwa nini Qur’an yako inatofautisha kati ya Sinagogi na Misikiti?Ikiwa dini yako ndiyo dini ya kweli tangu mwanzo, kwa nini Qur’an iseme wazi kwamba Sinagogi na Makanisa yalikuwepo, yakitajwa jina la Mungu kwa wingi?Kwa nini Allah awape heshima Wayahudi na Wakristo kwa kutaja majengo yao ya ibada, kama kweli dini zao ni “zilizopotoshwa”?Ukitazama kwa macho ya uhalisia, hoja hizi zinabomoa kabisa msingi wa Uislamu.Ndio maana mimi,Max Shimba, mtumwa wa Yesu Kristo, nasema kwa ujasiri:Hakuna jina jingine limepewa wanadamu tupate wokovu, isipokuwa jina la Yesu Kristo.(Matendo 4:12).Hitimisho​Aya ya Qur’an katikaSuratul Hajj 40inafichua ukweli mzito usioweza kufichwa: kwamba dini ya Uislamu haikuwa na mizizi kabla ya Muhammad. Qur’an yenyewe inakiri kwa uwazi kwamba kabla ya kuzaliwa kwa Uislamu kulikuwepo na jamii zilizomtumikia Mungu kupitia nyumba zao za ibada – Sinagogi kwa Wayahudi, na Makanisa kwa Wakristo. Kwa kulitaja jambo hili, Qur’an imethibitisha kwamba kumjua Mungu si jambo lililozaliwa katika karne ya saba, bali lilianza maelfu ya miaka kabla ya Muhammad kupitia Agano la Kale na likakamilishwa kwa Kristo katika Agano Jipya.Kwa mantiki ya kifalsafa, hili linaibua maswali magumu kwa Uislamu:Kama dini ya kweli ni moja tu, kwa nini Qur’an itaje Sinagogi, Makanisa na Misikiti kama majengo tofauti?Ikiwa Uislamu ulikuwepo tangu zama za Ibrahim, kwa nini Sinagogi na Makanisa havikuitwa Misikiti?Kwa nini Qur’an ipe heshima majengo ya ibada ya Wayahudi na Wakristo, wakati Waislamu hufundishwa mara nyingi kwamba dini hizi zimepotoshwa?Kihistoria, Sinagogi zilianza karne nyingi kabla ya Kristo, baada ya Wayahudi kuhamishwa Babeli. Hapo ndipo walipojenga utamaduni wa kukusanyika, kusoma Torati, na kumtaja Mungu wa Israeli. Vivyo hivyo, Makanisa ya Kikristo yalizaliwa baada ya ufufuo wa Yesu Kristo, yakieneza injili na mafundisho ya upendo na wokovu. Kwa hiyo, Qur’an inapovihesabu majengo haya kama sehemu ambapo jina la Mungu linatajwa kwa wingi, inakiri moja kwa moja kwamba dini za Kiyahudi na Kikristo zilikuwa na uhalali na ushawishi mkubwa kabla ya Uislamu.Kimaandiko, Biblia yenyewe imethibitisha kwa karne nyingi kabla ya Muhammad kwamba wokovu ni kwa kupitia Yesu Kristo pekee. Mtume Petro alisema wazi:“Wala hakuna wokovu katika mwingine awaye yote; kwa maana hapana jina jingine chini ya mbingu walilopewa wanadamu, tupate wokovu kwalo, isipokuwa jina la Yesu Kristo.”(Matendo ya Mitume 4:12).Kwa hiyo, Qur’an inapojaribu kuhalalisha Misikiti kama sehemu ya ibada ya Mungu, inajichanganya kwa sababu inatambua kwamba Sinagogi na Makanisa pia ni sehemu ambapo jina la Mungu linasemwa. Hii inathibitisha kwamba Mungu wa kweli amejifunua tayari kupitia historia ya Uyahudi na umwilisho wa Yesu Kristo, na wala si kupitia mafundisho mapya ya Muhammad.Kwa mtazamo wa kiroho, hili linapaswa kumfanya kila Mwislamu afikirie kwa makini: Je, kweli dini yako inatoka kwa Mungu, au ni mfumo uliojengwa baadaye ili kuiga yale yaliyokuwepo? Je, kweli unaweza kujiokoa kwa kushikamana na dini iliyojaa mkanganyiko wa maandiko, au kwa kumpokea Yesu Kristo ambaye ndiye njia, kweli na uzima? (Yohana 14:6).Ukweli unabaki pale pale:Uislamu ni dini ya baadaye, iliyoanzishwa na Muhammad, na haina mizizi ya kweli katika historia ya wokovu. Njia ya kweli, iliyowekwa tangu Agano la Kale na kukamilishwa katika Agano Jipya, ni Yesu Kristo pekee.Kwa hiyo, msomaji mpendwa, chaguo liko mikononi mwako. Unaweza kuendelea kushikamana na dini ya wanadamu, au ukaamua kumfuata Yesu Kristo, ambaye ndiye nuru ya ulimwengu na mwokozi wa roho zako.Mimi niMax Shimba, mtumwa wa Yesu Kristo.",

Abdullah said: And so I stayed there. Then the Messenger of Allah went off a stone’s throw away or a little farther (or something like that). Then he [Abdullah] mentioned a group of male members [haneen, i.e. men] who looked like Zutt people. ‘Affan narrated (or something like what ‘Affan said, Allah willing):They didn’t have any clothes on, and I didn’t see their genitals, and they were tall and scrawny. He [Abdullah] said:And they came and started to ride [yarkaboun] the Messenger of Allah, and the Prophet of Allah began to recite to them. And they started to move closer and lean around me, and get in my way,and I became intensely terrified of them, so I sat down (or something like that). And when the morning light broke, they began to go away (or something like that).Then the Messenger of Allah came back exhausted and in pain, or practically in pain, from how they had ridden him; He said:Indeed I am exhausted (or something like that). Then the Messenger of Allah put his head in my lap (or something like that). And the men came with tall white garments on, but the Messenger of Allah had fallen asleep. And I became more intensely terrified of them than I was the first time.‘Arim said in his hadith: Then some of them said to the others: This man has been given good things (or something like that) – indeed his eyes sleep – or they said: His eye (or something like that) – but his heart is awake. ‘Arim and ‘Affan narrated: Some of them said to the others: Come, let us make a riddle about him (or something like that). And some of them said to the others: Make a riddle about him, and we will solve it – or: We will make a riddle, and you all can solve it. Then some of them said to the others: He is like a master, who built a well-fortified building, then sent out food to people (or something like that) and whoever does not take his food – or he said: Whoever does not follow him – He punishes him severely (or something like that). And the others replied: Indeed the master is the Lord of the Worlds, and indeed the building is Islam, and the food isJannah, and this is he who bids people to come; and whoever follows after him will be inJannah. ‘Arim said in his hadith (or something like it) – and whoever does not follow after him will be punished (or something like that). Then the Messenger of Allah woke up and said: What did you see, oh Ibn Umm ‘Abd? And Abdullah said: I saw this and that. And the Prophet of Allah said: Nothing of what they said has been hidden from me? The Prophet of Allah said: They were a group of angels – or He said: They were angels. (Or whatever Allah wills.)

Muhammad ibn al-Husayn and Ali ibn Muhammad from Sahl ibn Ziyad from Muhammad ibn al-Walid Shabab al-Sayrafi from Aban ibn ‘Uthman from Abi ‘Abdillah  who has said the following “When the Messenger of Allah was about to die, he called to him al-‘Abbas Bbn ‘Abd al-Muttalib and Amir al-Mu’minin . He said to al-‘Abbas, “O uncle of Muhammad, will you inherit the legacy of Muhammad, pay his debts and fulfill his promises and commitments?” He responded, “O the Messenger of Allah, may Allah take my soul and the souls of my parents in service for your cause, I am an old man with a large number of dependents, with very little belongings while in generosity compete the winds.” He (the Messenger of Allah) said, “I will give them away to whoever would want them along with its rights and responsibilities.” Then he (s.a.) said, “O Ali, brother of Muhammad, will you pay off the liabilities of Muhammad, pay off his debt and take possession of his legacy?” He said, “Yes, May Allah take my soul and the soul of my parents in service for your cause, it is my responsibility and in my favor” He has said, “I looked at him and saw him take off even his ring from his finger and said to me: Wear this ring in my lifetime.” He (Ali) has said, “I looked at the ring when I wore it on my finger and wished to have it out of all his properties.” He then called upon Bilal loudly, “Bring me my helmet, the coat of arms, the flag, the Shirt, the Dhulfaqar (famous sword), al-Sahab, (the Turban) al-Burd, (the cloth), al-Abraqa, (the belt) and the staff.”Ali has said, “I had never before seen that belt. When it was brought its shine would almost take away one’s sight. It was of the belts of paradise.” He (the Messenger of Allah) then said, “O Ali, Jibril brought this for me and said, “O Muhammad, place it in the ring of the coat of arms and use it as a belt around your midsection. Then he asked that the two pairs of Arabian shoves be brought to him along with the shirt. One of them was already stitched and the other was not yet stitched. It was the shirt with which he take for the ’Isra’ (the night journey), the shirt while wearing it he came out on the day of ’Uhud. Three caps were brought, the cap used while on a journey, the cap used on the ‘Id days and the cap used on Fridays. Also the cap that was used during his meeting with his companions was brought to him.” Then he (the Messenger of Allah) said, “O Bilal, bring to us the two mules, the gray one and Dul dul and the two camels, al-Ghadba’ and al-Qaswa’ and the two horses.” Al-Janah would be kept near the door of the Mosque in case the Messenger of Allah needed it. Whenever he would need anything he would let a man ride on it to go for the task and the horse would run for the needs of the Messenger of Allah. Also Hayzum was brought to him, the donkey called ‘Ufayr were brought to him. He then said, “Take possession of these in my lifetime.” Amir al-Mu’minin has said, “The first one of the animals died was‘Ufayr who died at within the same hour that the Messenger of Allah died. He broke off his bound until he began to run until he came to the well of Bani Khatma in Qibaand threw himself into it and it became his grave.” It is narrated that Amir al-Mu’minin has said, “That donkey spoke to the Messenger of Allah saying: May Allah take my soul and the soul of my parents in service for your cause,my father related to me from his father from his grandfather from his father who lived with Noah in the Ark. Once Noah came to himand whipped him on his backand said: “From the descendents of this donkey there will a donkey on whose back the master and the last of the prophets will ride.” I thank Allah who has made me that donkey.Sahih al-Kafi Shaykh Baqir al-BehbudiMirʾāt al-ʿUqūl fī Sharḥ Akhbār Āl al-Rasūl (3/44) Allamah Baqir al-Majlisi (Al-Kāfi – Volume 1,Book 4, Chapter #38,The Armaments and Sacred Items belonging to the Holy Prophet that transferred to the Imam)",

Everything will perish save His Face. His is the Decision, and to Him you (all) shall be returned. S. 28:884. According to certain Sahih reports, Muhammad exhorted his followers to invoke/supplicate (du’a) him, which they did even after his death.3578.‘Uthman bin Hunaif narrated that a blind man came to the Prophet and said to him: “Supplicate to Allah to heal me.” He said: “If you wish, I will supplicate for you, and if you wish, you can be patient, for that is better for you.” He said: “Then supplicate to him.” He said: “So he ordered him to performWudu’and to make hisWudu’complete, and to supplicate with this supplication: ‘O Allah, I ask You and turn towards You by Your Prophet Muhammad, the Prophet of Mercy.

The man met Ibn Hunayf and complained to him about the matter – this being after the death (wisal) of the Prophet and after the caliphates of Abu Bakr and Umar – so Uthman ibn Hunayf, who was one of the Companions who collected hadiths and was learned in the religion of Allah, said: “Go to the place of ablution and perform ablution (wudu), then come to the mosque, perform two rak’as of prayer therein, and say:‘O Allah, I ask You and turn to Youthrough our Prophet Muhammad, the Prophet of mercy; O MUHAMMAD (Ya Muhammad), I turn through you to my Lord, that He may fulfill my need,’ and mention your need. Then come so that I can go with you [to the caliph Uthman].” So the man left and did as he had been told, then went to the door of Uthman ibn Affan, and the doorman came, took him by the hand, brought him to Uthman ibn Affan, and seated him next to him on a cushion. ‘Uthman asked, “What do you need?” and the man mentioned what he wanted, and Uthman accomplished it for him, then he said, “I hadn’t remembered your need until just now,” adding, “Whenever you need something, just mention it.” Then, the man departed, met Uthman ibn Hunayf, and said to him, “May Allah reward you! He didn’t see to my need or pay any attention to me until you spoke with him.” Uthman ibn Hunayf replied, “By Allah, I didn’t speak to him, but I have seen a blind man come to the Messenger of Allah and complain to him of the loss of his eyesight. The Prophet said, “Can you not bear it?’ and the man replied, ‘O Messenger of Allah, I do not have anyone to lead me around, and it is a great hardship for me.’ The Prophet told him, ‘Go to the place of ablution and perform ablution (wudu), then pray two rak’as of prayer and make the supplications.’” Ibn Hunayf went on, “By Allah, we didn’t part company or speak long before the man returned to us as if nothing had ever been wrong with him.”This is an explicit, unequivocal text from a prophetic Companion proving the legal validity of tawassul through the dead.The account has been classified as rigously authenticated (SAHIH) by Baihaqi, Mundhiri, and Haythami.

When the youths sought refuge in the cave, they said: Our Lord! grant us mercy from Thee, and provide for us a right course in our affair. So We prevented them from hearing in the cave for a number of years. Then We raised them up that We might know which of the two parties was best able to compute the time for which they remained. We relate to you their story with the truth; surely they were youths who believed in their Lord and We increased them in guidance. And We strengthened their hearts with patience, when they stood up and said: Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth; we will by no means call upon any god besides Him, for then indeed we should have said an extravagant thing. These our people have taken gods besides Him; why do they not produce any clear authority in their support? Who is then more unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah? And when you forsake them and what they worship save Allah, betake yourselves for refuge to the cave; your Lord will extend to you largely of His mercy and provide for you a profitable course in your affair. And you might see the sun when it rose, decline from their cave towards the right hand, and when it set, leave them behind on the left while they were in a wide space thereof. This is of the signs of Allah; whomsoever Allah guides, he is the rightly guided one, and whomsoever He causes to err, you shall not find for him any friend to lead (him) aright. And you might think them awake while they were asleep and We turned them about to the right and to the left, while their dog (lay) outstretching its paws at the entrance; if you looked at them you would certainly turn back from them in flight, and you would certainly be filled with awe because of them. And thus did We rouse them that they might question each other. A speaker among them said: How long have you tarried? They said: We have tarried for a day or a part of a day. (Others) said: Your Lord knows best how long you have tarried. Now send one of you with this silver (coin) of yours to the city, then let him see which of them has purest food, so let him bring you provision from it, and let him behave with gentleness, and by no means make your case known to any one: For surely if they prevail against you they would stone you to death or force you back to their religion, and then you will never succeed. And thus did We make (men) to get knowledge of them that they might know that Allah’s promise is true and that as for the hour there is no doubt about it. When they disputed among themselves about their affair and said:Erect an edifice over them— their Lord best knows them. Those who prevailed in their affair said:We will certainly raise a masjid over them. (Some) say: (They are) three, the fourth of them being their dog; and (others) say: Five, the sixth of them being their dog, making conjectures at what is unknown; and (others yet) say: Seven, and the eighth of them is their dog. Say: My Lord best knows their number, none knows them but a few; therefore contend not in the matter of them but with an outward contention, and do not question concerning them any of them. S. 18:9-22 ShakirNote how the following version translates the relevant part:Thus did We make their case known to the people, that they might know that the promise of God is true, and that there can be no doubt about the Hour of Judgment. Behold, they dispute among themselves as to their affair. (Some) said, “Construct a building over them”: Their Lord knows best about them: those who prevailed over their affair said, “Let us surely build a place of worship over them (alayhim masjidan).” S. 18:21 Y. AliAnd here’s the explanation given by some of Islam’s greatest expositors:And so just as We aroused them it was that We disclosed them to their people and the believers that they that is their people might know that God’s promise of resurrection is true by virtue of the fact that One Who has the power to make them sleep for such a long period of time or sustain them in that state without nourishment also has the power to resurrect the dead; and that as for the Hour there is no doubt no uncertainty concerning it. Behold idh adverbially qualifies a‘tharnā ‘We disclosed’ they were disputing that is the believers and the disbelievers among themselves their affair the affair of the youths with regard to building something around them as a monument; so they the disbelievers said ‘Build over them that is around them a building to cover them up; their Lord knows them best.’ Those who prevailed regarding their affair the affair of the youths namely the believers ‘We will verily set up over them around them a place of worship’for prayers to be performed therein. And this indeed took place at the entrance of the cave. (Tafsir al-Jalalaynhttps://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=0&tTafsirNo=74&tSoraNo=18&tAyahNo=21&tDisplay=yes&UserProfile=0&LanguageId=2; bold emphasis mine)(those who won their point said: “We verily, shall build a place of worship over them.”) Those who said this were the people of power and influence, but were they good people or notthere is some debate on this point, because the Prophet said…(Allah has cursed the Jews and the Christians who took the graves of their Prophets and righteous people as places of worship) Warning against what they did. We have reported about the Commander of the faithful `Umar bin Al-Khattab that when he found the grave of Danyal (Daniel) in Iraq during his period of rule, he gave orders that news of this grave should be withheld from the people, and that the inscription containing mention of battles etc., that they found there should be buried. (Tafsir Ibn Kathirhttps://www.alim.org/quran/tafsir/ibn-kathir/surah/18/21; bold emphasis mine)Ibn Kathir’s admission that there was some debate in respect to whether the people in this Islamic Rip Van Winkle story did something good by turning the resting place of these so-called sleepers into amasjidsince this contradicts Muhammad’s condemnation of such a practice illustrates the Muhammadan conundrum. It perfectly demonstrates Muhammad’s blatant inconsistency by providing further substantiation of how he would often do or say things in direct conflict with the Quran. After all, there is nothing in this fable suggesting that the Muslim deity disapproved of what the people did. It is merely the scholars’ realizing how their prophet’s sunna directly conflicts with the statements of his own book that led them to assume such in order to harmonize this blatant contradiction.It gets much worse.Muhammad made it obligatory for his followers to pray for him and even greet him in their prayers after his death:Abu Hurayra said that the Messenger of Allah said, “Whenever anyone greets me with peace, Allah will return my soul to me so that I can return the greeting.”Abu Bakr ibn Abi Shayba mentions that Abu Hurayra said that the Messenger of Allah said, “I WILL HEAR whoever blesses me at my grave. If someone is far away and blesses me, that is also conveyed to me.”…Ibn ‘Umar said, “Do a lot of prayer on your Prophet everyJumu’a. It is brought to him from you everyJumu’a.” One version has, “None of you blesses me but THAT HIS PRAYER IS SHOWN TO ME when he finishes it.”Al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali said that the Prophet said, “Bless me wherever you are. YOUR PRAYER will reach me.”One of them mentioned that the name of someone who blesses the Prophet IS SHOWN to the Prophet when he does it.Al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali said, “When you enter the mosque, greet the Prophet. The Messenger of Allah said, ‘Do not make my house a place of‘Idand do not make your houses graves. Bless me wherever you are. YOUR PRAYER will reach me wherever you are.’”…Sulayman ibn Suhyam said that he saw the Prophet in a dream and asked him, “Messenger ofAllah, do you recognise the greeting of those who come to you?” He replied, “YES, AND I ANSWER THEM.” (Qadi ‘Iyad Ibn Musa al-Yahsubi,Kitab Ash-shifa bi ta’rif huquq al-Mustafa (Healing by the recognition of the Rights of the Chosen One), translated by Aisha Abdarrahman Bewley English [Madinah Press, Inverness, Scotland, U.K., third reprint 1991, paperback], pp. 262-263; capital and underline emphasis mine)Notice how Muhammad himself classified the invocations and greetings that his followers were to offer to him assupplicationsandprayers. Muhammad is, therefore, personally responsible for the blatant idolatry that Muslims commit all over the world due to their invoking and speaking to a dead false prophet.And this notion of Muhammad being able to see the prayers of his followers even after his death is substantiated within the Quran itself:They will excuse themselves to you when you go back to them. Say: Urge no excuse, by no means will we believe you; indeed Allah has informed us of matters relating to you;and now Allah and His Apostle WILL SEE your doings (wa’sayara Allahu amalakum wa’rasooluhu), then you shall be brought back to the Knower of the unseen and the seen, then He will inform you of what you did. S. 9:94 ShakirThe word for “will see” (sayara) is a 3rd person masculine singular imperfect verb, and is in the subjunctive mood. The verse literally reads, “” Allah and his apostle,HEwill see.”Muhammad, therefore, made Allah’s seeing identical with his own sight, which in turn makes him omniscient and omnipresent like his god!To make matters much worse and more blasphemous than they already are, the Quran depicts Muhammad as being able to cleanse and purify his followers from their sins!Take alms out of their property,you would cleanse them and purify them thereby, and pray for them;surely your prayer is a relief to them; and Allah is Hearing, Knowing. S. 9:103 ShakirThat’s not all.Some of Islam’s most notable scholars have used Q. 4:64 to argue that Muslims can actually visit their dead prophet’s grave in order to personally ask him for his intercession. And this is exactly what Muhammadans have been doing since the demise of Muhammad:Although, this verse (64) was revealed in the background of a particular incident relating to hypocrites, yet its words yield a general ruling which stipulates that anyone who presents himself before the Holy Prophet and he prays for his forgiveness, he will be definitely forgiven. And ‘the presence before the Prophet,’ as it would have been during his blessed life in this mortal world, HOLDS THE SAME EFFECT EVEN TODAY as the visit to the sacred precincts of the Mosque of the Prophet and the act of ‘presenting’ oneself BEFORE THE BLESSED RESIDENT OF THE SANCTIFIED MAUSOLEUM FALLS WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF THIS RULE.Sayyidna ‘Ali has said: “Three days after we all had finished with the burial of the Messenger of Allah a villager came and fell down close to the blessed grave. Weeping bitterly, he referred to this particular verse of the Qur’an AND ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO THE BLESSED GRAVE, he said: ‘Allah Almighty has promised in this verse that a sinner, if he presented himself before theRasulof Allah, and theRasulelects to pray for his forgiveness, then he will forgive him. Therefore, here I am, presenting myself BEFORE YOU so that I may be blessed with YOUR prayer for my forgiveness.’ People personally present there at that time say that, in response to the pleading of the villager, a voice coming out from the sanctified mausoleum rang around with the words… You have been forgiven.” (al-Bahr al-Muhit) (Mufti Shafi Usmani,Maariful Quran, Volume 2, p. 486https://www.kalamullah.com/Books/Maariful%20Quran/English-MaarifulQuran-MuftiShafiUsmaniRA-Vol-2-Page-451-505.pdf; capital emphasis mine)And:“Allah is instructing the sinners when they commit a sin to come to the messenger of Allah and ask forgiveness in his presence and then they ask him to request forgiveness. And certainly if they did that, Allah would relent towards them and have mercy on them, and for that reason He said “they would have found Allah Oft-Returning, Merciful.”And Shaykh Mansur as-Sabbagh recollected in his book “The Perfections” (ash-Shama’il) the well-known (famous) transmission from ‘Utbi:“I was sitting by the grave of the Prophetand a Bedouin came and said: ‘Peace be upon you O Prophet of Allah. I heard Allah say: “And if they had come to thee when they had wronged their souls, and asked forgiveness of Allah, and if the Messenger had also asked forgiveness for them, they would have surely found Allah Oft-Returning with compassion and Merciful.”And I came to you asking forgiveness for my sin, taking you as intercessor to my Lord.’“Then he started reciting verses: ‘O You best of those whose bones are buried in al-Qa’a from the sweet scents of those bones the whole area of al-Qa’a and Akamu became perfumed.My self I sacrifice to the grave that you live in it is purity and in it is incredible generosity.’“Then the Bedouin departed and sleep overcame me.And I saw the Prophet in my sleep and he said: ‘Ya ‘Utbi, follow the Bedouin and give him the glad tidings that Allah has forgiven him.’” (Ibn Kathir,Tafsir of Qur’an al-Adheem[Dar al-Fikr, Beirut, 1992/1412], Volume 1, p. 643)It is apparent why Muslim scholars permitted such an idolatrous and blasphemous practice,According to the verse in question, Muhammad’s intercession is essential and necessary to obtain forgiveness:And We did not send any apostle but that he should be obeyed by Allah’s permission; and had they, when they were unjust to themselves,come to youand asked forgiveness of Allahand the Apostle had (also) asked forgiveness for them, they would have found Allah Oft-returning (to mercy), Merciful. S. 4:64 ShakirSince the Quran is supposed to be a source of guidance for all peoples at all times, not just at the time of Muhammad, this mean that passages such as the foregoing must still be applicable for all generations of Muslims. However, Muhammad is dead and the applicability of these injunctions are dependent on his followers being able to access his presence in order to benefit from his intercession.This leaves Muslims with one of two choices.Either these texts which require making contact with Muhammad are obsolete now that he is dead, which in turn makes the Quran an incoherent and impractical “revelation” seeing that much of its contents have become useless and unnecessary after Muhammad’s death. Or Muslims are still required to act upon these verses by going to the grave of Muhammad in order to contact a dead man whom they think is somehow still alive in his tomb.As the readers can see, some Islamic scholars chose the second view, which resulted in their doing the very thing that Muhammad cursed the Jews and Christians for doing. I.e., as a direct result of the teachings of the Quran and sunnah, Muslims have turned their prophet’s grave into a place of worship where they come and pray to a dead man to help save them from their sins!As if this weren’t shocking enough, certain Muslims would even face Muhammad’s grave rather than the Kabah whenever they would supplicate!It is just as necessary to have esteem and respect for the Prophet AFTER HIS DEATH AS IT WERE WHEN HE WAS ALIVE. This means to show it whenever the Prophet, hishadithorsunnaare mentioned, when anyone hears his name or anything about his life or how his family and relatives behaved. It includes respect for the People of his House (ah al-bayt) and his Companions…Abu Humayd said, “Abu Ja’far, theAmir al-Mu’minin, had a dispute with Malik in the Prophet’s mosque. Malik said to him, ‘Amir al-Mu’minin, do not raise your voice in this mosque. Allah taught the people how to behave by saying, ‘Do not raise your voices above the Prophet’(49:2) He praises people with the words,“Those who lower their voices in the presence of the Messenger of Allah.”(49:3) He censures people, saying,“Those who call you…”Respect for him WHEN HE IS DEAD is the same as respect for him when he was alive.”“Abu Ja’far was humbled by this. He asked Malik, ‘Abu Abdullah, do you faceqiblawhen you supplicate or do you face the Messenger of Allah?’ He replied, ‘Why would you turn your face from him when he is YOUR MEANS and the means of your father, Adam, to Allah on the Day of Rising? I face him and ASK HIM to intercede and Allah will grant his intercession. Allah says,“If, when you wronged yourselves, they had come to you.”’” (4:64) (Qadi ‘Iyad, pp. 237-238; capital and underline emphasis mine)With the foregoing in view, could it be any more obvious that Muhammad was an inconsistent hypocrite and idol-maker that did the very thing he condemned others for doing, and who turned himself into a god by causing his followers to look to him as an object of their worship?",

    "full_content": "PROOF THAT MUSLIMS ARE MUHAMMADANSIn this short post I am going present additional evidence that Islam is really Muhammadanism seeing that it has elevated Muhammad to godlike status, requiring its adherents to blindly follow him and love him unconditionally, just as much as they love the Muslim idol:Say: If your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your wives, your kindred, the wealth that you have gained, the commerce in which you fear a decline, and the dwellings in which you delight …are dearer to you than AllahANDHis Messenger, and striving hard and fighting in His Causethen wait until Allah brings about His Decision (torment). And Allah guides not the people who areAl-Fasiqun(the rebellious, disobedient to Allah). S. 9:24 Hilali-KhanYou (O Muhammad) will not find any people who believe in Allah and the Last Day, making friendship with thosewho oppose AllahANDHis Messenger (Muhammad), even though they were their fathers, or their sons, or their brothers, or their kindred (people). For such He has written Faith in their hearts, and strengthened them withRuh(proofs, light and true guidance) from Himself. And We will admit them to Gardens (Paradise) under which rivers flow, to dwell therein (forever). Allah is pleased with them, and they with Him. They are the Party of Allah. Verily, it is the Party of Allah that will be the successful. S. 58:22 Hilali-KhanIslam further commands Muslims to perfectly submit to Muhammad to the same extent and degree that they are supposed to submit to Muhammad’s god:But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you (O Muhammad) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions,and accept (them) with full submission. S. 4:65 Hilali-KhanThis is why obedience to Muhammad is the same as obeying Allah, and why a person must revert back to Muhammad’s decisions whenever scholars/leaders disagree:These are the limits (set by) Allah (or ordainments as regards laws of inheritance),and whosoever obeys AllahANDHis Messenger (Muhammad)will be admitted to Gardens under which rivers flow (in Paradise), to abide therein, and that will be the great success.And whosoever disobeys AllahANDHis Messenger (Muhammad), and transgresses His limits, He will cast him into the Fire, to abide therein; and he shall have a disgraceful torment. S. 4:13-14 Hilali-KhanO you who believe! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger (Muhammad), and those of you (Muslims) who are in authority. (And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves,refer it to Allah and His Messenger, if you believe in Allah and in the Last Day. That is better and more suitable for final determination. S. 4:59 Hilali-KhanHe who obeys the Messenger (Muhammad),has indeed obeyed Allah, but he who turns away, then we have not sent you (O Muhammad) as a watcher over them. S. 4:80 Hilali-KhanIt is not for a believer, man or woman, when AllahANDHis Messenger have decreed a matterthat they should have any option in their decision. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, he has indeed strayed in a plain error. S. 33:36 Hilali-KhanIn fact, obedience to Muhammad is so crucial for Muslim salvation that Allah absolutely refuses to love anyone who doesn’t obey his “prophet,” since he only loves those who surrender to Muhammad’s will:Say (O Muhammad to mankind): “If you (really) love Allah then follow me(i.e. accept Islamic Monotheism, follow the Qur’an and the Sunnah),Allah will love you and forgive you of your sins. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” Say (O Muhammad): “Obey Allah and the Messenger (Muhammad).” But if they turn away,then Allah does not like the disbelievers. S. 3:31-32 Hilali-KhanThe Muslim scripture makes it therefore explicitly clear that Muhammad has absolute, final authority and say-so over the lives of Muslims, since he pretty much owns them.Little wonder that Muslims are named “the followers of Muhammad” in the hadiths:Narrated Salim: I heard Um Ad-Darda’ saying, “Abu Ad-Darda’ entered the house in an angry mood. I said to him. ‘What makes you angry?’ He replied, ‘By Allah! I do not findthe followers of Muhammaddoing those good things (which they used to do before) except the offering of congregational prayer.” (This happened in the last days of Abu Ad-Darda’ during the rule of ‘Uthman). (Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 1, Book 11, Number 622https://www.searchtruth.com/book_display.php?book=11&translator=1&start=0&number=622)Narrated ‘Aisha: Allah’s Apostle said, “Ofollowers of Muhammad! There is none, who has a greater sense ofGhira(self-respect) than Allah, so He has forbidden that His slave commits illegal sexual intercourse or His slave girl commits illegal sexual intercourse. Ofollowers of Muhammad! If you but knew what I know, you would laugh less and weep more!” (Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 7, Book 62, Number 148https://www.searchtruth.com/book_display.php?book=62&translator=1&start=0&number=148)In light of the foregoing, I now furnish another explicit instance of Muslims deifying Muhammad by granting him the same devotion and service, which the Quran attributes to Allah.Note what these ahadith state in regards to Abu Bakr’s love and dedication to Muhammad:The Book of the Sunnah(11a) Chapter: The Virtue of Abu Bakr SiddiqIt was narrated that Abu Hurairah said:“The Messenger of Allah said: ‘The wealth of none of you has benefited me as much as the wealth of Abu Bakr.'” Abu Bakr wept and said: ‘O Messenger of Allah,I and my wealth areONLYfor you, O Messenger of Allah.'”Grade: Da’if(Darussalam)Reference: Sunan Ibn Majah 94In-book reference: Introduction, Hadith 94English translation: Vol. 1, Book 1, Hadith 94 (sunnah.comhttps://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:94)And:Abu Huraira reported: The Messenger of Allah said, “The wealth of no one has benefited me as much as the wealth of Abu Bakr.” Abu Bakr wept and he said, “My life and my wealth areONLYfor you, O Messenger of Allah.”Source: Musnad Aḥmad 7397Grade:Sahih(authentic) according to Ahmad ShakirAbu Bakr does for Muhammad what the Muslim scripture commands Muhammadans do for Allah, namely, devote their entire lives and wealth for their idol:Say: Lo! my worship and my sacrifice and my living and my dying are for Allah, Lord of the Worlds. S. 6:162 PickthallIn case the readers are unaware who Abu Bakr was, he is the one who gave his 6 or 7-year-old daughter Aisha to a 51-year-old Muhammad, who then physically consummated the marriage three years later when the minor had just turned 9!Aisha said: The Apostle of Allah married me when I was seven years old. The narrator Sulaiman said: Or six years.He had intercourse with mewhen I was nine years old.Grade: Sahih(Al-Albani) (Sunan Abu Dawud, Book 11, Number 2116https://sunnah.com/abudawud:2121)26 The Book of Marriage(29) Chapter: A Man Marrying Off HIS YOUNG DAUGHTERIt was narrated that ‘Aishah said: “The Messenger of Allah married me when I was seven years old, and he consummated the marriage with me when I was nine.”Grade: SAHIH(Darussalam)Reference: Sunan an-Nasa’i 3256In-book reference: Book 26, Hadith 61English translation: Vol. 4, Book 26, Hadith 3258 (sunnah.comhttps://sunnah.com/nasai:3256; capital emphasis mine)Hence, not only did Abu Bakr give his premature, prepubescent child to a 54-year-old man to sexually ravish, someone old enough to be Aisha’s grandfather, during a time when the premature girl was still playing on swings and with her dolls,Narrated Aisha:The Prophet engaged me when I was a girl of six (years). We went to Medina and stayed at the home of Bani-al-Harith bin Khazraj. Then I got ill and my hair fell down. Later on my hair grew (again) and my mother, Um Ruman, came to mewhile I was playing in a swing with some of my girl friends. She called me, and I went to her, not knowing what she wanted to do to me. She caught me by the hand and made me stand at the door of the house. I was breathless then, and when my breathing became all right, she took some water and rubbed my face and head with it. Then she took me into the house. There in the house I saw some Ansari women who said, “Best wishes and Allah’s Blessing and a good luck.” Then she entrusted me to them and they prepared me (for the marriage). Unexpectedly Allah’s Apostle came to me in the forenoon and my mother handed me over to him,and at that time I was a girl of nine years of age. (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Volume 5, Book 58, Number 234https://www.searchtruth.com/book_display.php?book=58&translator=1&start=0&number=234)‘A’isha reported that Allah’s Apostle married her when she was seven years old, and he was taken to his house as a bridewhen she was nine, and her dolls were with her; and when he (the Holy Prophet) diedshe was eighteen years old. (Sahih Muslim, Book 008, Number 3311https://www.searchtruth.com/book_display.php?book=008&translator=2&start=0&number=3311)He also sacrificed his whole life and wealth for this same man.In other words, Abu Bakr gave Muhammad the exact same service and devotion which the Quran exhorts Muslims to render unto Allah.Putting it simply, Abu Bakr took Muhammad as a god to be worshiped alongside Allah, with the express approval of the Islamic deity and his so-called messenger!",

This is better for you, if you but knew. S. 9:41 Hilali-KhanAnd who does more wrong than the one who invents a lie against Allah, while he is being invited to Islam? And Allah guides not the people who areZalimun(polytheists, wrong-doers and disbelievers) folk. They intend to put out the Light of Allah (i.e. the religion of Islam, this Qur’an, and Prophet Muhammad) with their mouths. But Allah will complete His Light even though the disbelievers hate (it). He it is Who has sent His Messenger (Muhammad) with guidance and the religion of truth (Islamic Monotheism) to make it victorious over all (other) religions even though theMushrikun(polytheists, pagans, idolaters, and disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah and in His Messenger Muhammed) hate (it). O You who believe! Shall I guide you to a commerce that will save you from a painful torment. That you believe in Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad),and that you strive hard and fight in the Cause of Allah with your wealth and your lives, that will be better for you, if you but know! (If you do so) He will forgive you your sins, and admit you into Gardens under which rivers flow, and pleasant dwelling in Gardens of‘AdnEternity [‘Adn(Edn) Paradise], that is indeed the great success. And also (He will give you) another (blessing) which you love, help from Allah (against your enemies) and a near victory. And give glad tidings (O Muhammad) to the believers. S. 61:7-11 Hilali-KhanAnd yet according to the hadiths, Muhammad’s best friend and father-in-law, the very man who married off his 9 year old premature, prepubescent manner to his 54 year old prophet,‘A’isha reported:Allah’s Messenger married me when I was six years old,and I was admitted to his house at the age of nine. She further said: We went to Medina and I had an attack of fever for a month, and my hair had come down to the earlobes. Umm Ruman (my mother) came to meand I was at that time on a swing along with my playmates. She called me loudly and I went to her and I did not know what she had wanted of me. She took hold of my hand and took me to the door,and I was saying: Ha, ha (as if I was gasping), until the agitation of my heart was over. She took me to a house, where had gathered the women of the Ansar. They all blessed me and wished me good luck and said: May you have share in good. She (my mother) entrusted me to them. They washed my head and embellished me and nothing frightened me. Allah’s Messenger came there in the morning,and I was entrusted to him.

The narrator Sulaiman said: Or six years.He had intercourse with me when I was nine years old. (Sunan Abu Dawud, Book 11, Number 2116https://sunnah.com/abudawud/12/76)Yunus b. Bukayr stated, from Hisham b. ‘Urwa, from his father who said, “The Messenger of God married ‘A’isha three years after (the death of) Khadija. At that time (of the contract) ‘A’isha had been a girl of six. When he married her she was nine. The Messenger of God died when ‘A’isha was a girl of eighteen.”This tradition is consideredgharib(unique in this line).Al-Bukhari had related, from ‘Ubayd b. Isma‘il, from Abu Usama, from Hisham b. ‘Urwa, from his father, who said, “Khadija died three years before the emigration of the Prophet. He allowed a couple of years or so to pass after that, and then he contracted marriage with ‘A’isha when she was six, thereafter consummating marriage with her when she was nine years old.”What ‘Urwah stated here ismursal, incomplete, as we mentioned above, but in its content it must be judged asmuttasil, uninterrupted.His statement, “He contracted marriage with ‘A’isha when she was six, thereafter consummating marriage with her when she was nine”IS NOT DISPUTED BY ANYONE, and is well established in thesahihcollections of traditions and elsewhere.

Death no longer has dominion over Him. For the death that He died, He died to sin once for all;but the life that He lives, He lives to God.” Romans 6:8-10“What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things? Who shall bring a charge against God’s elect? It is God who justifies. Who is he who condemns? It is Christ who died, and furthermore is also risen,who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us.” Romans 8:31-34“Seeing then that we have a great High Priestwho has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession. For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was in all points tempted as we are,yet without sin. Let us therefore comeboldlyto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.” Hebrews 4:14-16“This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which enters the Presence behind the veil, where the forerunnerhas entered for us, even Jesus, having become High Priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.” Hebrews 6:19-20“who has come, not according to the law of a fleshly commandment,but according to the power of an endless life… But He,because He continues forever, has an unchangeable priesthood.Therefore He is also able to save to the uttermostthose who come to God through Him,since He always lives to make intercession for them. For such a High Priest was fitting for us,who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and has become higher than the heavens;” Hebrews 7:16, 24-26“Now this is the main point of the things we are saying: We have such a High Priest,who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens, a Minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle which the Lord erected,and not man.” Hebrews 8:1-2“Not with the blood of goats and calves, but with His own bloodHe entered the Most Holy Place once for all, having obtained eternal redemption… Therefore it was necessary that the copies of the things in the heavens should be purified with these, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. For Christ has not entered the holy places made with hands, which are copies of the true,but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us; not that He should offer Himself often, as the high priest enters the Most Holy Place every year with blood of another—He then would have had to suffer often since the foundation of the world; but now, once at the end of the ages,He has appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself. And as it is appointed for men to die once, but after this the judgment, so Christ was offered once to bear the sins of many. To those who eagerly wait for Him He will appear a second time, apart from sin, for salvation.” Hebrews 9:12, 23-28“But this Man, after He had offered one sacrifice for sins forever,sat down at the right hand of God, from that time waiting till His enemies are made His footstool.For by one offering He has perfected foreverthose who are being sanctified.” Hebrews 10:12-14“looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame,and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.” Hebrews 12:2“But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God,the heavenly Jerusalem, to an innumerable company of angels, to the general assembly and church of the firstborn who are registeredin heaven, to God the Judge of all, to the spirits of just men made perfect,to Jesus the Mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling that speaks better things than that of Abel. Hebrews 12:22-24“To him who overcomes I will grant to sit with Me on My throne, as I also overcameand sat down with My Father on His throne.” Revelation 3:21“Now a great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a garland of twelve stars. Thenbeing with child, she cried out in labor and in pain to give birth… His tail drew a third of the stars of heaven and threw them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was ready to give birth, to devourher Childas soon as it was born. She borea male Child who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron. And her Child was caught up to God and His throne… Then I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, “Now salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of His Christ have come, for the accuser of our brethren, who accused them before our God day and night, has been cast down.’” Revelation 12:1-2, 4-5, 10Here’s where we see Satan working in and through Muhammad.Sunni Islam has taken these unique roles of Christ and attributed them to the Muslim “prophet.” This was obviously done for the purpose of steering Muslims away from the real Jesus by having them place their trust and hope in Allah’s “messenger.”According to specific Islamic narrations Allah will actually seat Muhammad on his own throne on the day of judgment and permit him to intercede for Muslims:“Even though the traditions we have mentioned on the authority of the Prophet and his Companions and the Followers indicate the correct interpretation ofmaqaman mahmudanin Qur. 17:79 (as referringto Muhammad’s role as intercessor on the Day of Resurrection),Mujahid’s statement that God will seat Muhammad on His Throne remains one whose soundness CANNOT BE REJECTED either on the basis of traditions (khabar) or on the basis of speculation (nazar). This is so because there is no tradition from the Messenger of God or anyone of his Companions or the Followers that declares it to be impossible…From what we have said, it has become clear that, it is not impossible for an adherent of Islam to say what Mujahid had said, namely, that God will seat Muhammad on His Throne. If someone says: We do not disapprove of God’s seating Muhammad on His Throne (in view of the following tradition transmitted by) ‘Abbas b. ‘Abd al-‘Azim–Yahya b. Kathir–al-Jurayri –Sayf al-Sadusi –‘Abdallah b. Salam: ‘On the Day of Resurrection, Muhammad will be on the Lord’s footstool (kursi),’ but we disapprove of God’s seating himtogether with Him, it should be said: Is it then permissible in your opinion that He seat him on it but not together with him? If he permits this, he is led to affirming that either he is together with Him, or God seats him (on the Throne) while being Himself either separate from it or neither contiguous with nor separate from it. Whatever alternative he chooses, he thereby enters into something that he disapproves. If he says that it is not permissible, he deviates from the statements of all the groups we have reported. This means diverging from the views of all adherents of Islam, since there is no other possible statement than those three,according to each of which Mujahid’s statement in this sense is not impossible.” (The History of Al-Tabari – General Introduction and From Creation to the Flood, translated by Franz Rosenthal [State University of New York Press (SUNY), Albany, NY 1989], Volume I, Appendix A: A Partial Translation of Tafsir on Qur. 17:79 (Above, pp. 75 f.), pp. 149, 151; bold and capital emphasis mine)Tabari wasn’t the only reputable scholar to narrate and/or comment this tradition:10. Al-Qurtubi’s CommentaryImam al-Qurtubi commented thus on the verse of the Exalted Station in hisTafsir:The third explanation of this verse is what al-Tabari reported from a party of scholars – among them Mujahid – whereby “the Exalted Station is the seating by Allah of the Prophet with Him on His Throne(kursiyyih).” They narrated a hadith to that effect, and al-Tabari backed up the possibility(jawâz)of such a thing with some extravagant statements(shatatin min al-qawl). However, what he said cannot be inferred [from the verse] except with over-subtlety as to meaning(al-talattuf bi al-ma‘nâ), and it is far-fetched(fîhi bu‘d).This is not to say that there is no such narration; only that [one endowed with] knowledge interprets it figuratively(al-‘ilmu yata’awwaluhu).Abu Sa‘id al-Naqqash[68]mentioned from Abu Dawud al-Sijistani:[69]“Whoever denies this hadith, WE STRONGLY CONDEMN HIM. The scholars of knowledge never stopped narrating this hadith. Who among them ever denied its possibility, even as he interpreted it?” (G. F. Haddad, The Prophet’s Seating on the Throne (Iq‘âd al-Nabî ‘alâ al-‘Arsh);https://sunnah.org/2008/07/18/the-prophets-s-seating-on-the-throne-2/; bold and capital emphasis mine)[67]Here al-Qurtubi proceeds to interpret as he had alluded that it should be done when he said: “This is not to say that there is no such narration; only that knowledge demands that it be interpreted figuratively.” (Ibid., bold emphasis mine)And:13.  Al-Barbahari’sIdée FixeIbn Abi Ya‘la relates in hisTabaqatthat the Hanbali shaykh Abu Muhammad al-Barbahari never sat to teachexcept he mentioned that the Prophet sits next to Allah on the Throne.[114][114]Ibn Abi Ya‘la,Tabaqat al-Hanabila(2:43).14.  Al-Najjad’s Attack on “Anyone That Contradicts Us”Ibn Abi Ya‘la wrote the following in his chapter on Abu Bakr al-Najjad inTabaqat al-Hanabila:‘Ali[115]narrated to me from Ibn Batta: Abu Bakr al-Najjad told us: Harun ibn al-‘Abbas[116]told us: Muhammad ibn Bishr[117]told us: ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn Sharik[118]told us: My father[119]told me: Abu Yahya al-Qattat[120]told us, From Mujahid:– Also –(2)Mu‘adh ibn al-Muthanna[121]told us: Khallad ibn Aslam[122]said: Muhammad ibn Fadl[123]told us, From Layth, From Mujahid:Concerning the verse: “It may be that thy Lord will raise you to an Exalted Station”: “He will seat him with Him on the Throne”(yujlisuhu ma‘ahu ‘alâ al-‘arsh).[124]Al-Najjad said: “I also asked [about it] Abu Yahya al-Naqid,[125]Ya‘qub al-Mutawwa‘i,[126]‘Abd Allah ibn Ahmad ibn Hanbal, and a group of our shaykhs, and they narrated to me the hadith of Muham­mad ibn Fudayl from Layth from Mujahid.“I also asked Abu al-Hasan al-‘Attar[127]about it, and he narrated to me the hadith of Mujahid. Then he said: ‘I heard Muhammad ibn Mus‘ab al-‘Abid say: “[The Prophet’s seating on the Throne will take place] in order for all creation to see his station before his Lord, and his Lord’s generosity towards him. Then the Prophet shall retire to his apartments and gardens and wives, and alone shall remain Allah in His Lordship(yanfaridu ‘azza wa jalla bi rubûbiyyatihi).”’“I also looked into the book of Ahmad ibn al-Hajjaj al-Marwazi, who is our imam and guide and proof in this. In that book I found what he mentioned concerning the rejection of the hadiths of ‘Abd Allah ibn Salam[128]and Mujahid,and he listed the names of the shaykhs WHO CRITICIZED THOSE WHO REJECTED THESE HADITHS OR OBJECTED TO THEM.“Therefore, what we declare and believe before Allah Almighty is what we have just described and made clear concerning the meanings of the hadithsquoted from the Prophet WITH AN UNINTERRUPTED CHAIN(al-ahadith al-musnada ‘an rasul Allah),—[129]and what was said by ‘Abd Allah ibn ‘Abbas—[130]and the scholars after him, which was handed down from elder to elder and from age to age until our shaykhs’ time concerning the saying of Allah: [It may be that your Lord will raise you to an Exalted Station]: the Exalted Station consists IN THE SEATING OF THE PROPHET WITH HIS LORD ON THE THRONE. WHOEVER DENIES THIS OR CONTRADICTS IT IS ONLY ATTEMPTING TO PROMOTE THE SAYINGS OF THE JAHMIS. HE SHOULD BE AVOIDED, EXPOSED, AND WARNED AGAINST.[131]“Similarly, I was told by Abu Bakr the writer,[132]from Abu Dawud al-Sijistani, that the latter said: ‘Whoever rejects the hadith of Mujahid is a Jahmi.’[133]“Furthermore, Muhammad ibn Suhayb[134]and a group of our shaykhs narrated to us from Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Malik al-Daqiqi[135]that he said: ‘I first heard this hadith fifty years ago,AND I NEVER HEARD ANYONE DENY IT. ONLY THE JAHMI HERETICS REJECT IT.’“Abu Isma‘il al-Sulami[136]mentioned to us the case of al-Tirmidhi who rejected the pre-eminence of the Prophet and belittled him.[137]Of such a man he said: ‘He does not believe in the Day of Judgment.’ I have seen our shaykhs among the friends of Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Hanbal give the same verdict.They condemned whoever rejected such pre-eminence. Allah has made this condemnation clear in the words of the scholars as far back as one can see. The people have all met this with approval, and no-one denies this nor disputes it.“Such is also my position. And should one swear a triple divorceby the seating by Allah of the Prophet on the Throne with Him, then consult me on the validity of his oath, I would say: Your words are true, your oath binding, and the divorce stands.“That is our doctrine, our religion, our belief upon which we were raised and upon which we shall die if Allah wills. We categorically condemn whoever rejects this pre-eminence to which the scholars referred and which they met with acceptance. Whoever rejects it is from the sects that are bound for destruction.”[138][131]Here al-Najjad moves from an apologetic and descriptive stance concerned primar­ily with the evidence at hand to an aggressive stance aiming at the persons of those who question it. Towards the end of the passage he once more modifies his attack so as to represent any disputation of Mujahid’s narration as an attack on the Prophet himself.[138]Abu Bakr al-Najjad in Ibn Abi Ya‘la’sTabaqat al-Hanabila(2:9-12). (Haddad; bold and capital emphasis mine)Specific Muslim scholars even went as far as to condemn those that would deny Muhammad’s enthronement as heretics who must be avoided, exposed and warned against:15. Ibn Batta’s DoctrineIbn Batta stated in his bookal-Sharh wa al-Ibana ‘ala Usul al-Sunna wa al-Diyana(“Elaboration of the Principles of Sunni Doctrine”):The Prophet shall be seated on the Throne with his Lord(yujlas ma‘a rabbihi ‘alâ al-‘arsh), and this privilege belongs to no-one else. Thus did Nafi‘ narrate it from Ibn ‘Umarfrom the Prophet concerning the verse: “It may be that thy Lord will raise you to an Exalted Station” – he said that He shall seat him with Him on the Throne. Thus also did Mujahid explain it, as narrated by Muhammad ibn Fudayl, from al-Layth, from Mujahid. (Ibid.; bold emphasis mine)Even the renowned scholar Ibn Taymiyyah and his star pupil Ibn Qayyim believed and embraced the veracity of this tradition!12. Ibn al-Qayyim’s List of SupportersIbn Qayyim al-Jawziyya[78]said in hisBada’i‘ al-Fawa’id:Al-Qadi [Ibn Abi Ya‘la][79]said: “Al-Marwazi[80]compiled a book on the superlative merits of the Prophet in which he mentioned his seating(iq‘âduhu)on the Throne(al-‘arsh).”Al-Qadi further said: “This is the position of Abu Dawud, Ahmad ibn Asram,[81]Yahya ibn Abi Talib,[82]Abu Bakr ibn Hammad,[83]Abu Ja‘far al-Dimashqi,[84]‘Abbas al-Duri,[85]Ishaq ibn Rahuyah (or Rahawayh),[86]‘Abd al-Wahhab al-Warraq,[87]Ibrahim al-Asbahani,[88]Ibrahim al-Harbi,[89]Harun ibn Ma‘ruf,[90]Muhammad ibn Isma‘il al-Sulami,[91]Muhammad ibn Mus‘ab al-‘Abid,[92]Abu Bakr ibn Sadaqa,[93]Muhammad ibn Bishr ibn Sharik,[94]Abu Qilaba,[95]‘Ali ibn Sahl,[96]Abu ‘Abd Allah ibn ‘Abd al-Nur,[97]Abu ‘Ubayd,[98]al-Husayn ibn Fadl,[99]Harun ibn al-‘Abbas al-Hashimi,[100]Isma‘il ibn Ibrahim al-Hashimi,[101]Muham­mad ibn ‘Imran al-Farisi al-Zahid,[102]Muhammad ibn Yunus al-Basri,[103]‘Abd Allah ibn Ahmad ibn Hanbal,[104]al-Marwazi, and Bishr al-Hafi.”[105]I say: It is also the position of Ibn Jarir al-Tabari,[106]and the leader of all the above in this is Mujahid, the imam of Qur’anic commentary. It is also Abu al-Hasan al-Daraqutni’s[107]who said:The hadith of Intercession narrated by AhmadIs traced back to the Elect, Ahmad.Also known to us is the hadith of his seatingOn the Throne,THEREFORE DO NOT DENY IT.Let the hadith pass exactly as narrated,And do not enter into false notions.Neither deny that the Prophet sits on the Throne,Nor deny that Allah makes him sit there![108][108]Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya,Bada’i‘ al-Fawa’id(1900 ed. 4:39-40, 1994 ed. 2:328-329). (Ibid.; bold and capital emphasis mine)And:16.  Ibn Taymiyya’s InheritanceIbn Taymiyya wrote:The scholars recognized by Allah and His accepted Friends have narrated that Muhammad the Messenger of Allahwill be seated by His Lord on the Throne next to Him.Muhammad ibn Fudayl narrated this from Layth from Mujahid in the commentary of the verse: “It may be that your Lord will raise you to an Exalted Station.” This was also mentioned through other chains, some traced back to the Prophet and some not.Ibn Jarir [al-Tabari] said: “This does not contradict the nearly-mass-narrated narrations(ma istafâdat bihi al-ahâdith)whereby the Exalted Station is the Intercession as agreed upon by the Imams of all Muslims.”He does not say that the Prophet’s seating on the Throne is denounced as false; ONLY SOME JAHMIS HELD IT SO. Nor is it objectionable to mention it in the context of a commentary on the verse.[141][141]Ibn Taymiyya,Majmu‘ al-Fatawa(Mufassal al-I‘tiqad– “Specifics of Belief” – 4:374). (Ibid.; bold and capital emphasis mine)In case Muhammadans argue that this narration is weak orda’eefhere is a report which is deemed to be reliable or sound:8. Another Narration From ‘Abd Allah ibn SalamFrom ‘Abd Allah ibn Salam, in a long hadith on the Day of Judgment: “A seat(kursî)will be placed for the Prophet on the right of Allah.”[38][38]Al-Hakim narrated it in hisMustadrak(4:568-569)and declared its chain sound(sahîh), as confirmed by al-Dhahabi. (Ibid.; bold and capital emphasis mine)Islamic scholar Livnat Holtzman mentions the controversy this hadith of Muhajid’s caused for the Muslim community:… According to Q. 17:79, God promised Muhammad ‘an honourable station’ (maqāman mahmūdan). Mujahid explained this phrase: ‘[God] will make [Muhammad] sit down with Him on His throne’.9Previous scholarship that discussed thishadīthfocused on its authenticity and its connection to the hardships that the illustrious historian and Quran exegete, Abu Jaʿfar Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari (d. 923), suffered from the Hanbalites of Baghdad.10…When Abu Bakr al-Najjad completed his thorough investigations about thishadīth, he issued a creed (ʿaqīda pl.ʿaqāʾid), a profession of faith which reflected the feelings of the Hanbalites on this matter:This is our profession of faith before God: We believe in the content of theahādīththat are attributed to the Messenger of God, but also to ʿAbd Allah ibn ʿAbbas (d. 687–8), and the scholars who succeeded him. Theseahādīthwere transmitted from one great scholar to another, from one generation to the next generation, until the times of our great teachers. We wrote theseahādīth, and meticulously investigated their content. Theseahādīthinterpret the meaning of the Quranic verse [Q. 17:79] ‘your Lord may exalt you to an honourable station’.According to theseahādīth, ‘the honourable station’ means that Muhammad will sit with His Lord on His throne. Whoever rejects this interpretation and refutes it, expresses the views of the Jahmiyya (the Muʿtazilites). One must avoid this person, turn away from him, and beware of him. Abu Bakr al-Khatib (d. 933) informed me that Abu Dawud al-Sijistani told him: ‘Whoever rejects thehadīthattributed to Mujahid is a Jahmite (Muʿtazilite)’.11Al-Najjad concluded that the belief in Muhammad’s noble virtue (fadīla) of sitting with God on the throne was one of the cornerstones of the Hanbalite creed. To illustrate the strength of this belief, al-Najjad explained that hypothetically, a man who declared that God would make Muhammad sit down with Him on the throne and thereafter took the oath on pain of triple divorce12to strengthen his declaration, should have never feared that he needed to divorce his wife. If this man came to al-Najjad to seek his legal advice whether he should divorce his wife or not, the scholar would tell him:You declared the truth, your oath is valid, and your wife should remain safely in her position. Because this is our way, our religion, and our creed. This is the root of our conviction from which we emerged. We will adhere to this conviction until the day we die.13Written in the middle of the tenth century, al-Najjad’s creed paraphrased thehadīthon Mujahid’s interpretation of ‘an honourable station’and elevated it to the degree of an article of faith for the Hanbalites. By doing so, al-Najjad sealed the turbulent history of thishadīthand silenced all the voices that spoke against thishadīthor merely doubted its veracity. Al-Najjad’s creed concluded the continuous controversy about thishadīthwith a smashing victory over the middle-of-the-road traditionalists.14To correctly evaluate al-Najjad’s creed, we need to examine the meaning of thishadīthand its history.Thehadīthon Mujahid’s interpretation of ‘an honourable station’ was one of the conspicuousahādīth al-sifāt, the traditions on the divine attributes that included anthropomorphic descriptions of God. Thishadīthwas controversial in spite of the fact that it did not describe God in any physical way or form.When read literally, thishadīthimplies that ‘an honourable station’ is an actual, physical place, and that God’s sitting on the throne (with Muhammad next to Him) is accordingly an actual sitting of a physical body. This reading obviously led totashbīh, namely comparing God to His creation and anthropomorphising Him. Laymen who heard thishadīthmight have been led to visualise a majestic human figure on a throne, sitting next to a much smaller human figure. The implied description of God in thishadīthwas unmistakably an anthropomorphic description… (Holtzman,Anthropomorphism in Islam: The Challenge of Traditionalism (700-1350) (Edinburgh Studies in Classical Islamic History and Culture)[Edinburg University Press, Ltd. 2019], Introduction, 1. The Narrator and Narrative: A Literary Analysis ofAhadith al-Sifat, pp. 4-5; bold emphasis mine)The ninth-century ultra-traditionalists who defended thishadīthand studied it,toiled a great deal to prove the antiquity of the text. Thus, a marginalmuhaddithby the name of Muhammad ibn ʿAbd al-Malik al-Daqiqi (d. 876) declared: ‘I heard thishadīthfor the last fifty years, and I never heard anyone rejecting it. Only the heretics and the Jahmites deny its veracity.’23The traditionalists also decorated thehadīthwith further details during their study sessions. The Hanbalite Abu ’l-Hasan ibn al-ʿAttar (d. 881) reminisced about such a study session, conducted by themuhaddithMuhammad ibn Musʿab al-ʿAbid al-Daʿʿaʾ (d. 843) from Baghdad:Once I heard Muhammad ibn Musʿab al-ʿAbid recount thishadīthwhich is attributed to Mujahid,namely ‘[God] will make [Muhammad] sit down with Him on His throne’. After transmitting thishadīth, Muhammad ibn Musʿab al-ʿAbid added: ‘So all the creatures will see Muhammad’s position at His Lord, and the respect that His Lord has for him. Thereafter, Muhammad will retire to his chambers, gardens and wives in Paradise, so God will remain alone in His ruling of the world.’24(Ibid., pp. 7-8; bold emphasis mine)Holtzman further notes how Muslims resorted to violence over this hadith, with some Hanbalites physically attacking the great Muslim exegete and historian al-Tabari for daring to question its veracity:The Hanbalite scholarship in defence of the anthropomorphic version included enthusiastic declarations supporting thishadīthand crowning it as authentic and valuable. Some Hanbalites went further and declared that thishadīthreflected the absolute truth, and should it be refuted, they would immediately divorce their wives.40The more reserved Hanbalites searched for Ahmad ibn Hanbal’s opinion on thishadīth. We found evidence of his supposed opinion inIbtāl al-Taʾwīlāt, a thematic Hadith compilation authored by the Hanbalite theologian and qadi Abu Yaʿla ibn al-Farraʾ (d. 1066; he was also the father of the biographer Ibn Abi Yaʿla). Abu Yaʿla dedicated a lengthy chapter in his book to the efforts of the Hanbalitemuhaddithūnto validate thehadīthattributed to Mujahid.Thus, the Hanbalites claimed that Ahmad ibn Hanbal himself ordered his disciples to transmit the anthropomorphic version attributed to Mujahid in the exact wording as it was received. The Hanbalites further claimed that Ahmad ibn Hanbal believed that the anthropomorphicversion should have been attributed to Mujahid’s teacher, thesahābīIbnʿAbbas.41These two claims do not correspond with the fact that thehadīthattributed to Mujahid was not included in theMusnadof Ahmad ibn Hanbal, the canonical Hadith compilation of the Hanbalites. Furthermore, Ahmad ibn Hanbal is not mentioned in the list of some thirty early Hanbalite scholars who professed their support for the anthropomorphic version attributed to Mujahid. These names were assembled by Abu Bakr al-Marwazi himself.42It is reasonable to assume that if al-Marawzi thought that Ahmad ibn Hanbal had supported thishadīth, or merely acknowledged its existence, he would have mentioned Ahmad ibn Hanbal at the top of the list.43The debate about the anthropomorphic version did not remain a theoretical issue. Thehadīthbecame a major component in the political agenda of the Hanbalites. In the year 922 (this is an approximate chronology, as the historical sources do not provide specific details about the following occurrence),a group of Hanbalites attacked the illustrious historian and Quran exegete Abu Jaʿfar Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari (d. 923) in Baghdad. Al-Tabari, as one of the sources claimed,refused to accept the anthropomorphic version attributed to Mujahid and had the audacity to reject thishadīthin public.44In his great exegesis of the Quran, al-Tabari implanted subtle references to his rejection of thehadīthattributed to Mujahid: he first established that ‘the majority of the scholars’ (akthar ahl al-ʿilm) believed that the ‘honourable station’ was Muhammad’s intercession for the people on the Day of Resurrection,45by quoting a dozenahādīthto prove his point.46In the next phase, al-Tabari remarked that ‘others’ (ākharūn) claimed that the ‘honourable station’ meant that God promised the Prophet that He would make the Prophet sit on the throne, next to God.47Thereafter, al-Tabari quoted ten anthropomorphic variants of thehadīthattributed to Mujahid.48As a rule, al-Tabari did not hesitate throughout his work of exegesis to accept certainahādīthas authentic and reject others. Nonetheless, he was extremely cautious in the case of thehadīthattributed to Mujahid: Al-Tabari declared that there is no way to refute the authenticity of thehadīthattributed to Mujahid, neither by locating some textual evidence (khabar) nor by applying rational reasoning (nazar).49This saying is far from the enthusiastic declarations of the Hanbalites support for thishadīth’s veracity. We note that the Hanbalites declared that the sceptics who did not accept thishadīthwere heretics. However, in the severe circumstances in which al-Tabari lived in Baghdad (he was forced to stay at home, while visitors were prevented from visiting him),50al-Tabari seemed to have no other choice but to issue his lukewarm support of thishadīth’s authenticity.In 929, strife arose between the Hanbalite supporters of Abu Bakr al-Marwazi and ‘a group of commoners’ (tāʾifa min ’l-ʿāmma) in Baghdad. This strife,which soon escalated into riots (fitna)was ignited because of an argument about Q. 17:79, and ‘an honourable station’. Relying on earlier sources,the Damascene historian Ibn Kathir (d. 1373) reported on these riotsin his monumental chronicleal-Bidāya wa’l-Nihāya. Ibn Kathir’s report is quite odd, because in it the ‘commoners’ claimed that ‘an honourable station’ was ‘the great intercession’,while the Hanbalites held their traditional position about Muhammad’s sitting on the throne. According to Ibn Kathir,the riots resulted in the deaths of an unspecified number of rioters. Ibn Kathir adds his opinion that according toSahīh al-Bukhāri, the canonical Hadith compilation, ‘an honourable station’ was indeed the great intercession.51It seems that by determining that there was only one possible interpretation of ‘an honourable station’, and that this interpretation was not the one favoured by the Hanbalites, Ibn Kathir (who was considered an indirect disciple of the Hanbalite Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya) expressed his reservation about the behaviour of the tenth-century Hanbalites and their choice of texts to venerate. Other authors of the Mamluk period,like the Shafiʿite Ibn Hajar al-ʿAsqalani (d. 1449), who in fact was inclined towards Ashʿarite theology,accepted thehadīthattributed to Mujahid.52Ibn Hajar even harshly condemned a later rationalistic scholar who refuted this hadīth.53The admission of the anthropomorphic version to the traditionalistic canon was therefore fully accomplished in the fifteenth century.

Ignaz Goldziher was the first scholar to address thishadīthand its consequences in both the public sphere (the 929 riots, al-Tabari’s ordeals, etc.), and the role that Mujahid played in shaping thishadīth: Goldziher,Die Richtungen der islamischen Koranauslesung, pp. 101–11. Franz Rosenthal’s informative introduction to his translation of al-Tabari’sKitāb al-Rusul wa’l-Mulūkfocuses on al-Tabari’s interpretation of Q. 17:79, and provides an interpretation of al-Tabari’s discussion on thehadīthattributed to Mujahid: Rosenthal, ‘General Introduction’, pp. 57–8, 69–78. Another illuminating discussion on al-Tabari’s interpretation of Q. 17:79 is Claude Gilliot’s. Gilliot also analyses a parallel passage authored by the Quran exegete Abu ʿAbd Allah al-Qurtubi (d. 1272): Gilliot,Exégèse, langue, et théologie, pp. 249–54. Two indispensable discussions are Swartz,A Medieval Critique of Anthropomorphism, p. 249, footnote 358; and Ramadān,Usūl al-Dīnʿinda ’l-Imām al-Tabarī, pp. 23–33. The confrontations between the Hanbalites and al-Tabari are briefly described in Turner, Inquisition in Early Islam, pp. 145–8. Turner determines that ‘[t]he violent Hanbalī response to al-Tabarī is most clearly understood if theirmadhhabis seen as a new player competing with al-Tabarī’smadhhab, which was equally new’: Turner,Inquisition in Early Islam, p. 146.

S. 25:1-2 ArberryThis means that Allah shall take Muhammad as a partner in his exclusive rule over the heavens and earth, making his so-called prophet into another sovereign lord besides himself!As if Islam’s blasphemy couldn’t get any worse, other supposedauthentic narrations assert that the names of Allah and Muhammad are written on the pillars of Allah’s throne, and that Adam was forgiven because he invoked Muhammad’s name!Al-Bayhaqi cited the following hadith in his book “Dala’il an-Nubuwwah” (Signs of Prophethood): Narrated ‘Umar Ibn al-Khattab: the Prophet said: “When Adam committed the sin, he said to Allah, ‘O My Lord,I ask You with reference to Muhammad to forgive me‘. Allah said: ‘O Adam! How did you know about Muhammad, for I have not yet created him?’ Adam replied, ‘O My Lord, when You created me,I looked up and saw inscribed on the legs of the Throne the words: There is no God worthy of worship except Allah and Muhammad is His Messenger. I knew that you do not attach to Your name but the name of the dearest of Your Creation.’ Allah said to Adam, ‘You have spoken rightly, Adam. Muhammad is the dearest of My Creation. I have forgiven youbecause you asked by Muhammad. AND HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR HIM, I WOULD NOT HAVE CREATED YOU.'” This hadith was narrated by al-Hakim who also classified it AS SAHIH (AUTHENTIC). Among the transmitters of this hadith is ‘Abd ar-Rahman Ibn Zayd Ibn Aslam. Al-Haythami said: “This hadith was reported by at-Dabarani and in its chain of transmitters are people I do not know. Al-Hakim was therefore mistaken in classifying this hadith as sahih because he himself criticised ‘Abd ar-Rahman Ibn Zayd Ibn Aslam in his bookad-Du’afa, so how can he state the authenticity of the hadith after he had criticised him?!!” (Tafsir Ibn Kathir, Part 1, Surah Al-Fatiah Surah Al-Baqarah, ayat 1 to 141, Abridged by Sheikh Nasib Ar-Rafa’i [Al-Firdous Ltd., London: Second Edition 1998], p. 107, fn 10; bold and capital emphasis mine)And:Abu Muhammad al-Makki, Abu’l-Layth as-Samarqandi and others related that when Adam rebelled, he said, “O Allah, forgive me my error BY THE RIGHT OF MUHAMMAD!” Allah said to him, “How do you know Muhammad?” He said, “I saw written in every place in the Garden, ‘There is no god but Allah, Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.’ So I knew that he was the most honoured creation in Your eyes.” SO ALLAH TURNED TO HIM AND FORGAVE HIM. It is said that this is the interpretation of the words of Allah,“Adam learned some words from his Lord.”(2:27)Another variant has that Adam said, “When you created me, I lifted my gaze to Your Throne AND WRITTEN ON IT WAS: ‘There is no god but Allah, Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah,’ so I knew there would be no one held in greater esteem by You THAN THE ONE WHOSE NAME YOU PLACED ALONGSIDE YOUR OWN NAME.” Allah then revealed to him, “By My might and majesty, he is the last of the prophets among your descendants. IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR HIM, I WOULD HAVE NOT CREATED YOU.” It is said that Adam was given thekunya, Abu Muhammad. Some people say that it was Abu’l-Bashar (the father of mankind).

When Allah Most High brought him to life,he looked at the Throne and saw my name, whereupon Allah Most High informed him: ‘He is the liege-lord of your offspring.’ When shaytan deceived them, they repented and sought intercessionwith my name from Him.”The hadith master al-Salihi cited it inSubul al-Huda wal-Rashad(Beirut ed. 1:86=Cairo ed. 1:104) and said “Its chain is good and there is no harm in it.”1Al-Halabi also cited it in hisSira(1:355)…II. Al-Khallal narrated inal-Sunna(1:261): Al Fadl ibn Muslim al-Muharibi narrated to us: Muhammad ibn ‘Isma narrated to us: Jundul [ibn Waliq,thiqaper al-Haythami] narrated to us: ‘Amr ibn Aws al-Ansari [masturper al-Dhahabi] narrated to us: from Sa‘id ibn Abi ‘Aruba: from Qatada: from Sa‘id ibn al-Musayyab: from Ibn ‘Abbas: Allah Most High revealed to ‘Isa: ‘O ‘Isa, Believe in Muhammad and command whosoever reaches his time among your Community that they believe in him.Were it not for Muhammad, I would not have created Adam, and were it not for Muhammad, I would not have created Paradise or Hellfire. Indeed, I created the Throne on top of the water and it shook, so I inscribed upon it LA ILAHA ILLA ALLAH MUHAMMADAN RASULULLAH, where upon it stood still.’” Al-Khallal said: “I read it to Abu ‘Abd Allah Muhammad ibn Bishr ibn Sharik and he concurred with it,”i.e.with its being authentic.Al-Hakim similarly narrated in theMustadrak(2:614-615=2:271): ‘Ali ibn Hamshadh al-‘Adl (258-338) [Abu al-Hasan al-Naysaburi, a major trustworthyhafiz] narrated to us by dictation: Harun ibn al-‘Abbas al-Hashimi (208-275) [thiqaper al-Khatib] narrated to us: Jundul ibn Waliq narrated to us, to the end of the above chain and text.

(Hadith of Adam’s tawassul through the Prophet; bold and capital emphasis mine)The foregoing makes it abundantly clear that Satan raised up Muhammad to become a Christ figure in order to mislead people from turning to the true Jesus, mankind’s only hope of salvation:“‘Let not your heart be troubled; you believe in God,believe also in Me. In My Father’s house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you.I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you,I will come again and receive you to Myself; that where I am, there you may be also. And where I go you know, and the way you know.’ Thomas said to Him, ‘Lord, we do not know where You are going, and how can we know the way?’ Jesus said to him, ‘I am the way, the truth,and the life. No one comes to the Fatherexcept through Me.’” John 14:1-6“Then Peter,filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, ‘Rulers of the people and elders of Israel: If we this day are judged for a good deed done to a helpless man, by what means he has been made well, let it be known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, by Him this man stands here before you whole. This is the “stone which was rejected by you builders, which has become the chief cornerstone.”Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.’ Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were uneducated and untrained men, they marveled.And they realized that they had been with Jesus. And seeing the man who had been healed standing with them,they could say nothing against it.” Acts 4:8-14It also proves that Islam is not a monotheistic faith since it has turned Muhammad into a demigod who shares in Allah’s exclusive traits.May the risen Lord of glory, God’s beloved Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, deliver Muslims from this antichrist figure, saving them from Allah and his so-called messenger, and bring them to his glorious feet in order to experience the everlasting love and peace that comes from him alone:All things have been delivered to Me by My Father, and no one knows the Son except the Father. Nor does anyone know the Father except the Son, and the one to whom the Son wills to reveal Him.Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.” Matthew 11:27-30“Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.” John 14:27“These things I have spoken to you,that in Me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation; but be of good cheer,I have overcome the world.” John 16:33All biblical references taken from the New King James Version (NKJV).FURTHER READINGMuhammad on the Throne – More on Islam’s Other GodQuran Difficulty: Is Allah the only ruler?APPENDIXThe belief in Muhammad’s enthronement led to strife and violence among the Muslims, which even resulted in al-Tabari being viciously opposed by a group of Hanbali Muslims. These Muslims went as far as to destroy al-Tabari’s very own home, and having him barred from speaking in certain places:Qur’an 17:79 was generally explained as eschatological274and the “praiseworthy position” as referring to Muhammad’s role as intercessor with the Deity on the Last Day. There was, however, a tradition reported from Mujahid (but not found in the preserved recension of his commentary on Qur. 17:79) which reached Tabari by way of ‘Abbad b. Ya’qub al-Asadi–Muhammad b. Fudayl–Layth b. Abi Sulaym.It states that the “praiseworthy position” means that Muhammad will be seated by God on his divine Throne.275Hanbalite championship of the tradition produced vehement outpourings of hatred against those who opposed it, allegedly with equal immoderation. They were called by every conceivable epithet; they were branded as innovators, liars, ignoramuses, heretics (zindiq), and unbelievers. Above all, they were seen as Jahmis, that is, speculative theologians (Mu’tazilites). Their nefarious intent–or, at any rate, the result of their attitude–was to deny a singular distinction to the Prophet, and, in the process, they defamed the exemplary Muslim that was Mujahid. Already Ibn Hanbal’s principal successor as spokesman for his legal school, Abu Bakr al-Marrudhi (d. 275/888),276was strongly partial to Mujahid’s tradition and appears to have employed the “praiseworthy position” question as a sort of shibboleth. Abu Bakr al-Marrudhi’s student and successor as the principal Hanbalite scholar of his time, Abu Bakr al-Khallal (d. 311/923), took up the subject. He reproduced his teacher’ s arguments at length and thus preserved them for posterity.277His younger contemporary, al-Barbahari (d. 329/941),278then made the most of it.He missed no opportunity to proclaim Qur. 17:79 as referring to the Prophet’s being seated on the divine Throne. Although al-Barbahari’s name is not mentioned in connectionwith Tabari’s Hanbalite trouble, he probably must be seen as the person behind much of it.The actual course of the events affecting Tabari can be reconstructed only with difficulty, because supporters on both sides apparently circulated conflicting reports. Matters appear to have come to a head after the year 290/903. In that year, Tabari returned to his home town in Tabaristan on a second, and apparently last, visit. He no doubt used the Khurasan Road that took him through such large cities as Dinawar and Hamadhan. In Dinawar, he stopped to meet with scholars there and to give lectures; he may very well have done the same in other towns along the road, thus making his journey profitable intellectually and, possibly, economically. On his return to Baghdad,three Hanbalites, who do not seem further identifiable,279asked Tabari about his views on Mujahid’s tradition. Tabari is said to have declared bluntly that it was absurd. Moreover, he added a flippant jingle ridiculing it:Praised be the One Who has no confidant and has no one to sit on His Throne.Enraged Hanbalites thereupon stoned his residenceand caused a serious disturbance which had to be subdued by force.Trouble with the Hanbalites that took a similar form is also reported at the time of Tabari’s death. In connection with it, Nazuk is mentioned as chief of police. He was appointed to this position only in 310/922[3], the year Tabari died, but he appears to have held high positions in the police before and may already have been in charge of Tabari ‘s protection against potential Hanbalite violence. In 309/921121, the wazir ‘Ali b. ‘Isa had offered Tabari the opportunity to debate the matter with the Hanbalites in his residence. Tabari agreed, but the Hanbalites did not show up.280However, shortly before his death, Hanbalite rioters supposedly pelted his house with stones so numerous that they formed a large wall in front of it. The verse just quoted was discovered written on the wall of Tabari’s house. After the riot subsided, someone wrote underneath it:Ahmad281will no doubt have a high position when he comes to the Merciful One,Who will draw him near and seat him nobly to spite an(y) envier,Upon a throne enveloping him282with perfume to make livid an(y) obnoxious liar.(He has) truly this unique position (al-maqam).This has been transmitted by Layth from Mujahid.Inscriptions in verse or prose on the walls of houses are a standard device of the Arabic literary imagination. It seems most unlikely that a man in Tabari’s position and at his advanced age would have beenso childish as to write inflammatory verses on the walls of his house. Someone else might have done itin order to provoke the Hanbalite mob. Presumably, however, the mural poetry was a literary embellishment invented by Hanbalites which crept into the vague reports about the event.283The fact that historiansreport another bloody incident aboutmaqaman mahmudaninvolving followers of the late Abu Bakr al-Marrudhi for the year 317/929284neither confirms nor invalidates the historicity of the event involving Tabari.The circumstances surrounding the debate about the “praiseworthy position” deserve some more clarification. In hisMusnad, Ibn Hanbal includes no traditions that supportthe interpretation of the phrase as referring to the Prophet’s being seated on the divine Throne.285One might argue that the very fact that Ibn Hanbal has nothing to say about the impossibility of Mujahid’s interpretationcould indicate that it could not be ruled out, using a type of argument employed by Tabari in his discussion of the matter. This, however, is very unlikely. Ibn Hanbal may have simply disregarded Mujahid’s tradition as irrelevant or objectionable. After all, it had noisnadgoing back to more ancient authorities or the Prophet, while there were traditions having the Prophet’s seal of approval that referred to intercession. Clearly,this made it necessary to invent an appropriate Prophetical tradition for Muhammad’s place on the divine Throne, AND THIS WAS DONE. Ibn Battah (d. 387/997) listed one such tradition with theisnadNafi’–’Abdallah b. ‘Umar–the Prophet.286He is certain not to have invented it himself. When it made its first appearance is hard to say; evidently, Abu Bakr al-Khallal in the early years of the century did not yet know it.InTafsir, Tabari has a long and interesting discussion of the “praiseworthy position.”287It again shows him to be the great compromiser. He admits that intercession is the interpretation that is solidly documented and which therefore has the best claim to being correct. However, he says, the other interpretation cannot entirely be ruled out. As the composition ofTafsirantedates the events described, it might be argued that Tabari interpolated the discussion inTafsirafter publication when Hanbalite hostility took such a truly ugly turn.288This cannot be proved. It might be assumed that he took at first a conciliatory attitude such as is displayed inTafsirand renounced it at some later date when he got disgusted with Hanbalite violence. This seems more likely, but again there is no hard evidence for it. Whatever it was, the view expressed inTafsirdid nothing to assuage Hanbalite opposition to him which appears to have had deeper roots than merely disagreement about a catchy slogan.The arguments marshalled by Tabarifor the purpose of making Mujahid’s tradition admissiblewere derived from speculative theology and show him adept in its ways of thinking and debating. The basic issue, as he sees it, is the problem of contiguity (mumassah). It had its proper place in physics but was transferred to theology by religious thinkers289Al-Ash’ari (ca 260324/873(41-935(6)), who lived most of his life in al-Basrah and was but a generation removed from Tabari, considered the matter important enough to refer to it in his discussion of anthropomorphism (tajsim).God is not upon the Throne, except in the sense that He is above it but does not touch it. According to Hisham b. al-Hakam,God’s location is in one specific place (fi makan dun makan). His place is the Throne, and He is in touch with it. The Throne encompasses and delimits Him. Another view holds that the Creator fills the Throne and is in touch with it. At this point,al-Ash’ari adds that some hadith scholars hold that the Throne is not filled by Him and that He (is thus able to) SEAT HIS PROPHET WITH HIMSELF ON THE THRONE.290Tabari considers the problem of God completely filling the Throne. He remarks on His contiguity and finds that only three possibilities apply to it. For him, however,the crucial point that must be made is that God’s seating of Muhammad on the Throne, with or without Himself, does not imply divinity (“lordship”rububiyyah) for the Prophet or deny his status as a human being (“servantship”‘ubudiyyah). In fact,the implied hint at Muhammadan divinitywould appear to be the most objectionable feature of Mujahid’s tradition. In touching upon this aspect,Tabari comes close to the possible reason why Mujahid might have made this seemingly un-Islamic statement. Christianity speaks of the Son not only as sitting on a throne but also of some mysterious being as sitting together with the Father in His Throne (Rev. 3:21). Even in remote Mecca, Mujahid could have heard about these viewsor seen one of the many representations of the Trinity or the enthroned Christ.291He may very well have felt that Muhammad should be similarly distinguished as was the prophet of Christianity. (Rosenthal,The History of Al-Tabari, Introduction, pp. 71-77)276. For Abu Bakr Ahmad b. Muhammad b. al-Haljaj al-Marrudhi, see Ibn Abi Yaia,Tabaqat, I, 56-63; Sam’ani,Ansab, XII, 201 f.; Yaqut,Mu’jam, IV, 506, s. v. Marty al-Rudh. According to Dhahabi,‘Uluww, 125, 1. 2, he wrote in defense of Mujahid’s tradition (see below, n. 277). Ibn Abi Ya’la,Tabaqat, 6o, states that al-Marrudhi was asked about the Jahmiyyah’s rejection of the “story of the Throne.” This may refer to alleged Mu’tazilah views on the location of the Throne, rather than, specifically, to the tradition of Mujahid.277. For Abu Bakr al-Khallal, see Sezgin,GAS, I, 511 f. I wish to thank J. van Ess for providing me with a xerox copy of Khallal,Musnad, 75-99.278. For al-Hasan b. ‘Ali b. Khalaf al-Barbahari, see Sezgin,GAS, 1, 512; Laoust, inMelanges Massignon, III, 22-5. Ibn Abi Ya’la,Tabaqat, II, 18-45, gives a good picture of his generally extremist positions. “Whenever al-Barbahari attended a meeting,he would mention that God seats Muhammad with Himself on the Throne.” In 323/935,he was in hiding and his followers were strictly forbidden to assemble. One of them was accusedof having set a disastrous fire in al-Karkh, see Hamadhani,Takmilah, 79 f., ed. Cairo, XI, 294-6. See further Brockelmann,GAL, Suppl. I, 344, and the indexes ofEclipseand Massignon,Passion2, as well as Allard,Attributs, 103 f.279. The three were Abu ‘Abdallah al-Jassas, Ja’far b. ‘Arafah, and al-Bayadi. The identification of al-Bayadi with Abu ‘Ali Muhammad b. ‘lsa al -Bayadi was proposed by the editor ofIrshid, VI, 436, n. 1, but requires confirmation. This individual, whose family claimed ‘Abbasid descent, wrote on Qur’an reading. He was killed by the Qarmatians in 294/906 on his return from the pilgrimage, seeTB, II, 401; Sam’ani,Ansab, 384.On the incident, see also Goldziher,Muslim Studies, II, 158 (II, 168, of the original German). Goldziher’s reference was to Suyuti,Tahdhir, 161, whose source scurrilously attributes this information to a storyteller in the streets of Baghdad. (Ibid., pp. 72-73)285. Sec Ibn Hanbal,Musnad, 1, 375 f., 398 f., III, 354, for traditions on intercession. Forthe tradition of Gabriel sitting “on a footstool” or “on the throne,” presumably the divine Throne, between heaven and earth, see Ibn Hanbal,Musnad, III, 306: Ibn Hajar,Fath, X, 305.286. See Laoust,Profession de foi d’Ibn Batta, text, 61, trans., 112 f., especially note I. In addition to Mujahid, al-Wahidi (d. 468/1075) refers to a tradition of Ibn Masud, see Razi,Tafsir, XXI, 32. He may have the same tradition in mind, mixing up, as it sometimes happens, ‘Abdallah b. Umar and ‘Abdallah b. Masud. A tradition of ‘A’ishah on the subject is discussed in Ibn al-Jawzi,Daf’, 81,hadithno. 39.287. SeeTafsir, XV, 97, 1. 10-100, 1. 22. See the translation below, Appendix A, below, pp. 149-51. For another partial translation, see Andrae,Person, 270-2. For Tabari’s real feelings about Mujahid and his tradition, it may be indicative that he rejects a view expressed by him with unusual harshness in connection with his commentary on the same verse of the Qur’an, seeTafsir, XV, 96, 11. 26-31. (Ibid., p. 75)291. Not much can be made in this connection of the allegation that Mujahid used material provided by Christians and Jews in his Qur’an commentary. See Ibn Sa’d,Tabaqat, V, 344, 1. 7, and the remark transmitted through Abu Bakr b. ‘Ayyash (below, translation, n. 72) in Dhahabi,Mizan, III, 439; Ibn Hajar,Tahdhib, X, 43; Sezgin,GAS, 1, 29. As one would expect, Dhahabi refers to Mujahid’s view ofmakaman mahmudanwith disapproval.On Mujahidand the vibrating of the divine Throne, see Goldziher,Richtungen, 108 f.A similar but different idea was already expressed in Khallil,Musnad, 82. The Muslims would be the laughing stock of Christiansif they denied to Muhammad the honor of sitting on the divine Throne, while granting semidivine status to Jesus. (Ibid., p. 277)",

    "full_content": "Why is Palestine Not Mentioned in the Qur’an?By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaFor Max Shimba Ministries OrgIntroductionA close reading of the Qur’an reveals a striking omission: the namePalestineis never mentioned. Instead, the Qur’an consistently affirms the unique and divinely chosen status of Israel and the land granted to the children of Israel. This raises a significant theological and historical question: if Allah himself never sanctified or even acknowledged “Palestine” in the Qur’an, why do contemporary Muslims advocate so strongly for Palestinian claims against Israel? This tension exposes both a religious and political paradox.The Qur’anic Recognition of IsraelInSurat al-Baqara 2:40, Allah addresses the Israelites directly:“O Children of Israel! Remember My favor which I bestowed upon you, and fulfill My covenant upon you, and I will fulfill your covenant from Me, and fear only Me.”This verse highlights that Israel—not the Arab nations—was the recipient of divine favor. The Qur’an does not record a parallel address to the Arabs, nor does it affirm that Palestine, as a geographical or theological entity, holds any divine sanctity.Israel’s Superiority According to the Qur’anAllah’s words inSurat al-Baqara 2:47emphasize Israel’s exalted status:“O Children of Israel! Remember My favor which I bestowed upon you and that I preferred you over all peoples.”Here, the Qur’an explicitly affirms that the Israelites were divinely chosen and elevated above other nations—including the Arabs. This divine election becomes a source of envy and resentment, particularly among Arabs who are excluded from this covenantal privilege.Theological Implications of the Omission of PalestineWhile the Qur’an repeatedly acknowledges Israel as a blessed nation, it is silent on the existence or significance of Palestine. There is no verse declaring Palestine as a sacred land, nor any recognition that the Arab peoples inherited the divine covenant. Consequently, the Muslim claim to Palestine rests not on scriptural authority, but on political and ideological constructs that developed much later.Israel as the Recipient of Revelation and ProphecyFurther evidence is found inSurat al-Jaathiya 45:16:“And indeed We gave the Children of Israel the Scripture and judgment and prophethood, and We provided them with good things, and We preferred them over all the worlds.”The Qur’an acknowledges that Israel was entrusted with Scripture (Kitab), divine law (hukm), and prophecy (nubuwwa). These privileges are not attributed to Arabs or Palestinians. Thus, the very text that Muslims hold as divine testimony reinforces Israel’s unique role in salvation history.Historical and Contemporary EnvyThis recognition helps explain the persistent animosity of many Arab nations toward Israel. According to the Qur’an itself, Israel is chosen and divinely favored, while the Arabs are not. Such exclusion breeds theological jealousy and political hostility, fueling centuries of conflict and attempts to delegitimize Israel’s existence.ConclusionThe Qur’an itself provides the foundation for understanding why the modern concept of “Palestine” lacks divine legitimacy. By consistently affirming Israel’s chosen status and entirely omitting Palestine, the Qur’an inadvertently supports the biblical truth that Israel is God’s covenant people. For Christians, this serves as yet another confirmation that God’s promises to Israel remain unshaken. No matter the political manipulations or hostilities, Israel continues to stand as a nation blessed by God, both biblically and—ironically—even according to the Qur’an.Author’s NoteThis reflection is presented as part of the theological mission ofMax Shimba Ministries Org, which is dedicated to proclaiming the truth of the gospel and defending the authority of Scripture against distortions.Maxwell Shimba, Th.D.Servant of Jesus ChristMax Shimba Ministries Org ©2016.

    "full_content": "Muhammad Alifia Kifuani Kwa Aisha: Uchambuzi wa Kisomi, Kihistoria, na MajadilianoNa: Dr. Maxwell ShimbaUtanguliziTukichambua historia ya maisha ya Mtume Muhammad, mojawapo ya taarifa zinazozua mjadala mkubwa ni hadithi inayosema kwamba Mtume alifariki akiwa mikononi mwa mke wake Aisha. Hadithi hii inapatikana katika tafsiri ya Ibn Ishaq yaSirat Rasul Allah, ambapo Aisha anasema:\"Mtume alifia kifuani pangu wakati wa zamu yangu: Sijamkosea mtu yoyote yule kuhusiana naye. Ilikuwa ni kwa sababu ya kutokujua kwangu na udogo uliozidi kiasi hata Mtume akanifia mikononi mwangu.\"(Guillaume, A., 1955, The Life of Muhammad, Oxford University Press, Karachi, Pakistan, p. 682)Hadithi hii inatolewa kama ushahidi wa kihistoria kwamba Aisha alikuwa na umri mdogo wakati wa ndoa na kifo cha Mtume Muhammad. Hata hivyo, taarifa hizi zimekuwa msingi wa mjadala mkubwa wa kisomi, kihistoria, na kimaadili.Umri wa Aisha na Ndoa ya Mtume MuhammadTaarifa nyingi za kihistoria zinadai kuwa Aisha aliolewa akiwa na umri wa miaka sita na ndoa yao ilikamilika akiwa na miaka tisa. Hadithi hizi zinapatikana katika baadhi ya vyanzo vya msingi vya Kiislamu kama Sahih al-Bukhari na Sahih Muslim.\"Aisha alisema: Mtume alikamilisha ndoa yake nami nilipokuwa na miaka tisa.\"(Sahih al-Bukhari, Hadithi 5133; Sahih Muslim, Hadithi 1422)Hata hivyo, baadhi ya wataalamu wa kisasa wanahoji uhalali wa taarifa hizi za umri mdogo. Wana hoja kwamba rekodi hizi zinaweza kuwa zimeongezwa baadaye kwa sababu za kisiasa au za kidini, au kwa sababu za makosa ya tafsiri ya historia. Kwa mfano, Muhammad Hamidullah na Jonathan A. C. Brown wanasema kuwa muktadha wa kihistoria unaweza kuashiria kwamba Aisha alikua mkubwa zaidi kuliko ilivyoelezwa katika baadhi ya hadithi.\"The age of Aisha at marriage is widely debated. Some early sources suggest she was very young, but contextual evidence may point to a higher age at consummation.\"(Brown, J.A.C., 2009,Misquoting Muhammad, Harvard University Press)Hii inasababisha mjadala wa kihistoria na kimaadili: Je, historia hii inapaswa kutafsiriwa kisawa na kwa wingi wa vyanzo, au je, taarifa za hadithi zinasalia kuwa chanzo cha msingi cha ushahidi wa umri wa Aisha?Mchango wa Aisha katika Historia ya KiislamuHaijalishi umri wake, Aisha aliwahi kuwa mmoja wa wake wa Mtume Muhammad wenye ushawishi mkubwa. Alijulikana kwa ujuzi wake katika:Sharia (Sheria za Kiislamu)– Aisha alichangia kwa kiasi kikubwa katika tafsiri za fiqh na masuala ya kisheria.Hadithi (Ufunuo wa Mtume)– Alieleza mamia ya hadithi ambazo zimekuwa msingi wa mafunzo ya Kiislamu.Siasa na Historia– Aisha alihusika katika matukio ya kihistoria, ikiwemo vita vya sipi baada ya kifo cha Mtume Muhammad (Vita ya Jamal).Hii inathibitisha kuwa nafasi yake haikupunguzwa kwa umri, bali alichangia kwa kiwango kikubwa katika jamii ya Kiislamu.Mjadala wa Kisomi na MaadiliUchunguzi wa hadithi hizi umekua na mjadala mkubwa kimaadili. Wanaochunguza historia ya Kiislamu na hadithi za Mtume wanahoji kama ndoa ya umri mdogo inafaa kutumika kama kielelezo cha maadili leo. Wana hoja kwamba muktadha wa kihistoria ulikuwa tofauti na wa leo, na utamaduni wa wakati huo ulikuwa unakubaliana na ndoa za mapacha wachanga.Hii inapelekea mjadala wa kisomi:Wanaosema umri mdogo:Wanasema hadithi ni ya kihistoria na inapaswa kuaminiwa kama ilivyoandikwa.Wanaosema umri mkubwa:Wanasema muktadha, mashahidi wa nyongeza, na rekodi za kihistoria zinaonyesha kuwa Aisha alikua mkubwa zaidi.Hii inatoa nafasi ya kujadili kwa kina muktadha wa kihistoria na kimaadili wa ndoa ya Mtume Muhammad.HitimishoKwa kumalizia, hadithi inayosema Mtume Muhammad alifariki mikononi mwa Aisha ni muhimu katika uelewa wa historia ya Kiislamu. Ingawa taarifa za umri wa Aisha zinatofautiana, ni wazi kwamba alichangia kwa kiasi kikubwa katika jamii ya Kiislamu. Uchambuzi wa kisomi unahimiza kuzingatia vyanzo vingi, muktadha wa kihistoria, na mjadala wa kimaadili.Mjadala huu unadhihirisha umuhimu wakusoma historia kwa makinina kuzingatia tafsiri za kisasa na za jadi, bila kupuuzia ushahidi wa kihistoria.MarejeoGuillaume, A.

    "full_content": "Allah na Muhammad Wamemkopia Mtume Paulo: Uchanganuzi wa KitaalumaNa: Dr. Maxwell ShimbaUtanguliziMijadala kuhusu uhusiano kati ya Qur’an na Biblia imekuwa ikijitokeza mara kwa mara katika uwanja wa theolojia na falsafa ya dini. Swali kuu ni: Je, Qur’an ni ufunuo mpya kutoka kwa Allah, au ni mkusanyiko wa masimulizi yaliyotokana na maandiko ya Biblia? Kwa uchunguzi wa kitaaluma, ni wazi kwamba sehemu kubwa ya Qur’an inajengwa juu ya simulizi na mafundisho yaliyokuwepo katika Biblia maelfu ya miaka kabla ya Muhammad. Hoja hii inaleta hitimisho kwamba Muhammad na Allah waliegemea sana mafundisho ya Biblia na kwa namna fulani kumkopia Mtume Paulo, ambaye alieneza Injili ya Yesu Kristo kwa mataifa.1. Qur’an na Urejeleo wa BibliaQur’an imejaa marejeo ya moja kwa moja ya simulizi za kibiblia, zikiwemo:Yusufu(Sura ya 12 – Surat Yusuf), simulizi lililokuwapo katika Biblia takriban miaka 3500 kabla ya Qur’an.Imran na familia yake(Sura ya 3 – Surat Al Imran), iliyoelezwa Biblia miaka 3000 kabla ya Muhammad.Yona mwana wa Mittai(Sura ya 10 – Surat Yunus), simulizi lililojulikana tayari katika Agano la Kale.Ibrahimu(Sura ya 14 – Surat Ibrahim), Baba wa Imani, ambaye simulizi zake ziliandikwa Biblia karne nyingi kabla.Maria mama wa Yesu(Sura ya 19 – Surat Maryam), simulizi la kibiblia lililotangulia sana Qur’an.Aidha majina na habari za manabii wakubwa kama Musa, Haruni, Daudi, Sulemani, Yakobo, Isa, na Yohana Mbatizaji, yamechukuliwa moja kwa moja kutoka Biblia. Qur’an hata hivyo haijawahi kutoa simulizi mpya, bali imetoa muhtasari usio na kina wa habari zilizokwishajulikana kwa Wayahudi na Wakristo.2. Ushahidi wa Qur’an Kuhusu Chanzo cha HabariQur’an yenyewe inakiri kuwa Muhammad alisimuliwa habari za manabii na hakupewa ufunuo mpya kuhusu wao:Qur’an 4:164– “...na mitume wengine hatukukuhadithia habari zao, na Mwenyezi Mungu alimsemeza Musa.”Qur’an 40:78– “...miongoni mwao tumekusimulia, na miongoni mwao hatukukusimulia.”Aya hizi zinathibitisha kuwa Muhammad alitegemea masimulizi yaliyokuwepo, badala ya kupokea ufunuo wa kipekee. Hii inapingana na madai ya Wahyi mpya, na inathibitisha urejeleo wa maandiko ya Biblia.3. Qur’an Inavyowaamuru Waislamu Kurudi Kwenye BibliaQur’an mara kadhaa inawaelekeza wafuasi wake warejee katika vitabu vya awali (Torati na Injili):Al-An’aam 6:154–155– Musa alipewa Kitabu kilicho na maelezo ya kila kitu, na watu wakaamrishwa wakifuate.An-Nisaa 4:136– Waislamu wanahimizwa waamini vitabu vilivyoteremshwa kabla ya Muhammad.Al-Maaida 5:46– Injili ni nuru na uwongofu; yeyote aikataye hana nuru.Yunus 10:94– Muhammad mwenyewe aliambiwa akipata shaka, aulize kwa wale wanaosoma Maandiko yaliyokuwa kabla yake.Kwa hiyo, hoja ya Waislamu kuwa Biblia imechakachuliwa inapingana moja kwa moja na Qur’an. Ikiwa Biblia ingekuwa imepotoshwa, basi Allah asingewaelekeza wafuasi wake warejee humo.4. Hoja Dhidi ya Waislamu Wapinga BibliaKudai Biblia ni ya Paulo– Ikiwa kweli ni ya Paulo, kwa nini simulizi zake zimo katika Qur’an? Hii inamaanisha Allah na Muhammad walimkopa Paulo, na kwa mantiki hiyo Paulo anakuwa “akbar” (mkubwa) mbele ya Allah na Muhammad.Kudai Biblia imechakachuliwa– Ikiwa imechakachuliwa, kwa nini Qur’an imejaa marejeo yake na kwa nini Allah aliwaamuru warejee humo?5. HitimishoKwa uchambuzi wa kitaaluma, ni dhahiri kwamba:Qur’an imejengwa juu ya simulizi za Biblia.Muhammad hakupokea ufunuo mpya, bali alisimuliwa habari zilizokuwa tayari katika Biblia.Qur’an yenyewe inakiri na kuthibitisha uhalali wa Maandiko ya awali, ikiwemo Torati na Injili.Hoja za Waislamu dhidi ya Biblia zinapingana na ushahidi wa Qur’an.Kwa hiyo, hoja inabaki kuwa:Allah na Muhammad walimkopia Mtume Paulo na Biblia nzima. Paulo, kwa maana hiyo, anakuwa mkubwa mbele ya Muhammad na Allah, kwani maandiko yake yamekuwa msingi wa masimulizi ya Qur’an.Mwisho, wito unabaki pale pale:Njoo kwa Yesu Kristo, Mungu Mkuu, aliyefunuliwa katika Biblia, ambaye ndiye nuru na wokovu wa ulimwengu wote.",

    "full_content": "Muhammad’s Bribing People to Be/Remain MuslimsThe Quran states that part of the money given in charity is to go towards enticing individuals to become Muslims. In other words, Allah sanctions Muslims to buy off or bribe non-Muslims to embrace Islam:As-Sadaqat(here it means Zakat) are only for theFuqara’(poor), andAl-Masakin(the poor) and those employed to collect (the funds);and for to attract the hearts of those who have been inclined (towards Islam); and to free the captives; and for those in debt; and for Allah’s Cause (i.e. forMujahidun– those fighting in the holy wars), and for the wayfarer (a traveller who is cut off from everything); a duty imposed by Allah. And Allah is All-Knower, All-Wise. S. 9:60 Hilali-KhanHere’s how some of Islam’s greatest expositors interpreted this text. All emphasis will be mine.The voluntary almsgivings the alms to be dispensed are only for the poor who cannot find anything to suffice them in the least and the needy who cannot find anything to suffice them and those who work with them that is with these alms in other words the one who collects them the one who takes the oaths from those who claim them the slave to be manumitted by contract as well as the tax-summoner;and those whose hearts are to be reconciled so that they might become Muslims or that Islam might be firmly established or that their peers might become Muslims or that they might defend Muslims all of whom are classed according to different categories. According to al-Shāfi‘ī the first and the last of these categories are no longer given of the alms-tax today because of the established power of Islam; in contrast the other two categories are given of the alms-tax according to the sounder opinion; and for the manumission of slaves that is for slaves to be manumitted by contract and for the debtors those in debt if they have taken out a debt without intending thereby an act of disobedience or those who have repented but have nothing with which to fulfil the penalty of expiation or to set things right between people even if they be wealthy; and for the way of God that is for those who are engaged in the struggle of those for whom there is no share of the booty fay’ even if they be wealthy; and for the traveller the one cut off from resources during his journey — a duty imposed by God farīdatan ‘a duty’ is in the accusative because of an implied verb sc. faradahā ‘which He has imposed’. And God is Knower of His creatures Wise in His actions. Thus it is impermissible to dispense these alms-proceeds other than to these categories or to deny these proceeds to any one of these categories if they exist. The Imam must divide these proceeds among them equally but he is permitted to give priority to certain individuals over others within any one category. The lām of li’l-fuqarā’ ‘for the poor’ indicates that it is obligatory to include every individual of these categories in the distribution of the proceeds; it is not however obligatory to do so when the person in charge of the monies has to apportion it but finds that it is insufficient. Indeed in such a situation it suffices to give three individuals from each category but anything less than that is not sufficient as is indicated by the plural form. The Sunna shows that the prerequisite condition for receiving a share of such monies is that the person be a Muslim but not a Hashimī or a Muttālibī. (Tafsir al-Jalalaynhttps://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=0&tTafsirNo=74&tSoraNo=9&tAyahNo=60&tDisplay=yes&UserProfile=0&LanguageId=2)Allah then explained who is entitled to these alms, saying: (The alms are only for the poor) for the folk of the Platform (and the needy) among the pilgrims, (and those who collect them) i.e. the collectors of alms,(and those whose hearts are to be reconciled) by giving them gifts such as Abu Sufyan and his companions. These were 15 men, (and to free the captives) the captives who want to ransom themselves (and the debtors) those who incurred debts to fulfil works which are for the obedience of Allah, (and for the cause of Allah) and for the fighters for the cause of Allah, (and (for) the wayfarers) guests, the passer-by; (a duty imposed by Allah) an allotment from Allah for these. (Allah is Knower) of these, (Wise) regarding that which He has ordained for these categories of people. (Tanwîr al-Miqbâs min Tafsîr Ibn ‘Abbâshttps://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=0&tTafsirNo=73&tSoraNo=9&tAyahNo=60&tDisplay=yes&UserProfile=0&LanguageId=2)Those employed to collect AlmsThose employed to collect alms deserve a part of the alms, unless they are relatives of the Messenger of Allah, who are not allowed to accept any Sadaqah. Muslim recorded that `Abdul-Muttalib bin Rabi`ah bin Al-Harith and Al-Fadl bin Al-`Abbas went to the Messenger of Allah asking him to employ them to collect the alms. The Messenger replied…(Verily, the alms are not allowed for Muhammad nor the relatives of Muhammad, for it is only the dirt that the people discard.) Al-Mu’allafatu Qulubuhum There are several types of Al-Mu’allafatu Qulubuhum.There are those who are given alms to embrace Islam. For instance, the Prophet of Allah gave something to Safwan bin Umayyah from the war spoils of Hunayn, even though he attended it while a Mushrik. Safwan said, “He kept giving me until he became the dearest person to me after he had been the most hated person to me.” Imam Ahmad recorded that Safwan bin Umayyah said, “The Messenger of Allah gave me (from the spoils of) Hunayn while he was the most hateful person to me. He kept giving me until he became the most beloved person to me.” Muslim and At-Tirmidhi collected this Hadith, as well. Some of Al-Mu’allafatu Qulubuhum are given from almsso that they become better in Islam and their heart firmer in faith. For instance,the Prophet gave some of the chiefs of the Tulaqa’ a hundred camels each after the battle of Hunayn, saying…(I give a man (from the alms) while another man is dearer to me than him, for fear that Allah might throw him on his face in the fire of Jahannam.) It is recorded in the Two Sahihs that Abu Sa`id said that `Ali sent the Messenger of Allah a gold nugget still in its dirt from Yemen.The Prophet divided it between four men: Al-Aqra` bin Habis, `Uyaynah bin Badr, `Alqamah bin `Ulathah and Zayd Al-Khayr, saying…(To draw their hearts closer.)Some people are givenbecause some of his peers might embrace Islam, while others are given to collect alms from surrounding areas, or to defend Muslim outposts. Allah knows best. (Tafsir Ibn Kathirhttps://www.alim.org/tafsir/ibn-kathir/?surah=9&ayah=60)The so-called authentic narrations provide instances where Muhammad paid off folks to become and/or remain Muslims:Narrated ‘Amr bin Taghlib:Allah’s Apostle gave (gifts) to some people to the exclusion of some others. The latter seemed to be displeased by that. The Prophet said, “I give to some people, lest they should deviate from True Faith or lose patience, while I refer other people to the goodness and contentment which Allah has put in their hearts, and ‘Amr bin Taghlib is amongst them.” ‘Amr bin Taghlib said, “The statement of Allah’s Apostle is dearer to me than red camels.”Narrated Al-Hasan: ‘Amr bin Taghlib told us that Allah’s Apostle got some property or some war prisoners and he distributed them in the above way (i.e. giving to some people to the exclusion of others).(Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 53, Number 373:https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3145)Narrated Anas:The Prophet said, “I give to Quraish people in order to let them adhere to Islam, for they are near to their life of Ignorance (i.e. they have newly embraced Islamand it is still not strong in their hearts).”(Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 53, Number 374:https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3146)Narrated Anas bin Malik:When Allah favored His Apostle with the properties of Hawazin tribe as Fai (booty),he started giving to some Quraish men even up to one-hundred camels each, whereupon some Ansari men said about Allah’s Apostle, “May Allah forgive His Apostle! He is giving to (men of) Quraish and leaves us, in spite of the fact that our swords are still dropping blood (of the infidels).” When Allah’s Apostle was informed of what they had said, he called the Ansar and gathered them in a leather tent and did not call anybody else along with them. When they gathered, Allah’s Apostle came to them and said, “What is the statement which, I have been informed, and that which you have said?” The learned ones among them replied, “O Allah’s Apostle! The wise ones amongst us did not say anything, but the youngsters amongst us said, ‘May Allah forgive His Apostle;he gives the Quraish and leaves the Ansar, in spite of the fact that our swords are still dribbling (wet) with the blood of the infidels.’” Allah’s Apostle replied, “I give to such people as are still close to the period of Infidelity (i.e. they have recently embraced Islam and Faith is still weak in their hearts). Won’t you be pleased to see people go with fortune, while you return with Allah’s Apostle to your houses? By Allah, what you will return with is better than what they are returning with.” The Ansar replied, “Yes, O Allah’s Apostle, we are satisfied.” Then the Prophet said to them, “You will find after me others being preferred to you. Then be patient till you meet Allah and meet His Apostle at Al-Kauthar (i.e. a fount in Paradise).” (Anas added:) But we did not remain patient.(Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 53, Number 375:https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3147)A religion which needs to pay off individuals to embrace it simply cannot be from the true God. It is Satan who would use the riches and pleasures of the world to make folks convert to a particular belief or tradition.",

All emphasis will be mine.The founder…On his commercial journeys toSyriaand Palestinehe became acquainted withJewsandChristians, and acquired an imperfectknowledgeof their religion and traditions. He was a man of retiring disposition, addicted toprayerandfasting,and was subject to epileptic fits. In his fortieth year (A.D. 612), he claimed to have received a call from theAngel Gabriel, and thus began his active career as theprophetofAllahand theapostleofArabia… He took the field against his enemies, conquered severalArabian,Jewish, andChristiantribes, enteredMeccain triumph in 630, demolished theidolsof the Kaaba, became master ofArabia, and finally united all the tribes under one emblem and one religion. In 632 he made his lastpilgrimagetoMeccaat the head of forty thousand followers, and soon after his return died of aviolentfever in the sixty-third year of his age, the eleventh of the Hejira, and the year 633 of theChristianera.The sources of Mohammed’s biography are numerous,but on the whole untrustworthy, being crowded with fictitious details, legends, and stories. None of his biographies were compiled during his lifetime, and the earliest was written a century and a half after his death. TheKoranis perhaps the only reliable source for the leading events in his career. His earliest and chief biographers are Ibn Ishaq (A.H. 151=A.D. 768), Wakidi (207=822), Ibn Hisham (213=828), Ibn Sa’d (230=845), Tirmidhi (279=892), Tabari (310-929), the “Lives of the Companions of Mohammed”, the numerousKoraniccommentators [especially Tabari, quoted above, Zamakhshari 538=1144), and Baidawi (691=1292)], the “Musnad”, or collection of traditions of Ahmad ibn Hanbal (241=855), the collections of Bokhari (256=870), the “Isabah”, or “Dictionary of Persons who knew Mohammed”, by Ibn Hajar, etc. All these collections and biographies are based on the so-called Hadiths, or “traditions”, the historical value of which is more thandoubtful.These traditions, in fact, represent a gradual, and more or less artificial, legendary development, rather than supplementary historical information. According to them, Mohammed was simple in his habits, but most careful of his personal appearance. He loved perfumes andhatedstrong drink. Of a highly nervous temperament, he shrank from bodily pain. Though gifted with great powers ofimagination, he was taciturn. He was affectionate and magnanimous,piousand austere in the practice of his religion,brave,zealous, and above reproach in his personal andfamilyconduct.Palgrave, however, wisely remarks that “the ideals ofArabvirtuewere first conceived and then attributed to him“. Nevertheless, with every allowance for exaggeration, Mohammed is shown by his life and deeds to have been a man of dauntlesscourage, great generalship, strongpatriotism, merciful by nature, and quick to forgive.And yet he was ruthless in his dealings with theJews, when once he had ceased to hope for their submission. He approved ofassassination, when it furthered his cause; however barbarous or treacherous the means, the end justified it in his eyes; and in more than one case he not only approved, but also instigated the crime.Concerning hismoralcharacterand sincerity, contradictory opinions have been expressed by scholars in the last three centuries. Many of these opinions are biased either by an extremehatredof Islam and its founder or by an exaggerated admiration, coupled with ahatredofChristianity.Lutherlooked upon him as “adevilandfirst-bornchild ofSatan“. Maracci held that Mohammed and Mohammedanism were not very dissimilar toLutherandProtestantism. Spanheim and D’Herbelot characterize himas a “wickedimpostor“, and a “dastardlyliar“, while Prideaux stamps himas a wilful deceiver. Such indiscriminate abuse is unsupported by facts.Modern scholars, such as Sprenger, Noldeke, Weil, Muir, Koelle, Grimme, Margoliouth, give us a more correct and unbiased estimate of Mohammed’s life andcharacter, and substantially agree as to his motives, prophetic call, personal qualifications, and sincerity. The various estimates of several recent critics have been ably collected and summarized by Zwemer, in his “Islam, a Challenge to Faith” (New York, 1907). According to Sir William Muir, Marcus Dods, and some others, Mohammed was at first sincere,but later, carried away by success, he practiseddeceptionwherever it would gain his end. Koelle “finds the key to the first period of Mohammed’s life in Khadija, his first wife”,after whose death he became a prey to hisevilpassions. Sprenger attributes the allegedrevelationsto epileptic fits, or to “a paroxysm of catalepticinsanity“.Zwemer himself goes on to criticize the life of Mohammed by the standards, first, of theOldandNew Testaments, both of which Mohammed acknowledged asDivine revelation; second, by thepaganmoralityof hisArabiancompatriots; lastly,by the newlawof which he PRETENDED to be the “divinely appointed medium and custodian”. According to this author, theprophetwasfalseeven to theethicaltraditions of theidolatrousbrigands among whom he lived, and grossly violated the easy sexualmoralityof his own system. After this, it is hardlynecessaryto say that, in Zwemer’s opinion,Mohammed fell very far short of the most elementary requirements ofScripturalmorality. Quoting Johnstone, Zwemer concludes by remarkingthat the judgment of these modern scholars, however harsh, rests on evidence which “comes all from the lips and the pens of his own devoted adherents. . .And the followers of theprophetcan scarcely complain if, even on such evidence, the verdict of history goes against him“.TenetsThe principal tents of Mohammedanism are laid down in theKoran. As aids in interpreting the religious system of theKoranwe have:first, the so-called “Traditions”, which are supposed to contain supplementary teachings and doctrine of Mohammed,a very considerable part of which, however, is decidedly spurious;second, the consensus of thedoctorsof Islam represented by the most celebrated imâms, the founders of the various Islamicsects, theKoraniccommentators and the masters of Mohammedansjurisprudence;third, theanalogy, ordeductionfrom recognized principles admitted in theKoranand in the Traditions.Mohammed’s religion, known among its adherents as Islam, contains practically NOTHING ORIGINAL; it is A CONFUSED combination of nativeArabianheathenism,Judaism,Christianity,Sabiism (Mandoeanism), Hanifism, andZoroastrianism…(1) DogmaThe doctrines of Islam concerningGod— HisunityandDivine attributes—are essentially those of theBible; but to the doctrines of theTrinityand of theDivine SonshipofChristMohammed had the strongest antipathy.As Noldeke remarks, Mohammed’s acquaintance with those twodogmaswas superficial; even the clauses of theCreedthat referred to them were not properlyknownto him, and thus he felt that it was quite impossible to bring them into harmony with the simpleSemiticMonotheism; probably, too, it was this consideration alone that hindered him from embracingChristianity(Sketches from Eastern History, 62).The number ofprophetssent byGodis said to have been about 124,000, and ofapostles, 315. Of the former, 22 are mentioned by name in theKoran— such asAdam,Noah,Abraham,Moses,Jesus.According to the Sunni, theProphetsandApostleswere sinless and superior to theangels, and they had the power of performingmiracles. Mohammedan angelology anddemonologyare almost wholly based on laterJewishand earlyChristiantraditions. Theangelsarebelievedto be free from allsin; they neither eat nor drink; there is no distinction of sex among them. They are, as a rule, invisible, save to animals, although, at times, they appear inhumanform. The principalangelsare:Gabriel, the guardian and communicator ofGod’s revelationtoman;Michael, the guardian ofmen; Azrail, theangelof death, whosedutyis to receivemen’ssoulswhen they die; and Israfil, theangelof theResurrection.In addition to these there are theSeraphim, who surround the throne ofGod, constantlychantingHis praises; the Secretaries, who record the actions ofmen; the Observers, who spy on every word and deed ofmankind; the Travellers, whosedutyit is to traverse the whole earth in order toknowwhether, and when,menutter the name ofGod; theAngelsof the Seven Planets; theAngelswho have charge ofhell; and a countless multitude ofheavenlybeings who fill allspace. The chiefdevilis Iblis, who, like his numerous companions, was once the nearest toGod, but was cast out for refusing to pay homage toAdamat the command ofGod. Thesedevilsare harmful both to thesoulsand to the bodies ofmen, although theirevilinfluence is constantly checked by Divine interference.Besidesangelsanddevils, there are also jinns, or genii, creatures of fire, able to eat, drink, propagate, and die; somegood, othersbad, but all capable of futuresalvationand damnation.Godrewardsgoodand punishesevil deeds. He is merciful and is easily propitiated byrepentance. The punishment of the impenitent wicked will be fearful, and the reward of the faithful great. Allmenwill have torise from the deadand submit to theuniversal judgment. The Day ofResurrectionand ofJudgmentwill be preceded and accompanied by seventeen fearful, or greater, signs inheavenand on earth, and eight lesser ones, some of which are identical with those mentioned in theNew Testament. TheResurrectionwill be general and will extend to all creatures —angels, jinns,men, and brutes.The torments ofhelland the pleasures ofParadise, but especially the latter, are proverbially crass and sensual.Hellis divided into seven regions: Jahannam, reserved for faithless Mohammedans; Laza, for theJews; Al-Hutama, for theChristians; Al-Sair, for theSabians; Al-Saqar, for the Magians; Al-Jahim, foridolaters; Al-Hawiyat, forhypocrites. As to the torments ofhell, it isbelievedthat the damned will dwell amid pestilential winds and in scalding water, and in the shadow of a black smoke.Draughts of boiling water will be forced down their throats. They will be dragged by the scalp, flung into the fire, wrapped in garments of flame, and beaten with iron maces. When their skins are well burned, other skins will be given them for their greater torture. While the damnation of allinfidelswill be hopeless andeternal, the Moslems, who, though holding thetruereligion, have been guilty of heinoussins, will be delivered fromhellafter expiating their crimes.The joys andgloriesofParadiseare as fantastic and sensual as the lasciviousArabianmindcould possibly imagine. “As plenty of water is one of the greatest additions to the delights of the BedouinArab, theKoranoften speaks of the rivers ofParadiseas a principal ornament thereof; some of these streams flow with water, some with wine and others with honey, besides many other lesser springs and fountains, whose pebbles are rubies and emeralds, while their earth consists of camphor, their beds of musk, and their sides of saffron.But all theseglorieswill be eclipsed by the resplendent and ravishing girls, orhouris, ofParadise, the enjoyment of whose company will be the principalfelicityof the faithful. These maidens arecreatednot of clay, as in the case of mortalwomen, but of pure musk, and free from all natural impurities, defects, and inconveniences. They will be beautiful and modest and secluded from public view in pavilions of hollow pearls.The pleasures ofParadisewill be so overwhelming thatGodwill give to everyone the potentialities of a hundredindividuals. To eachindividualsa large mansion will be assigned, and the very meanest will have at his disposalat least 80,000 servants and seventy-two wives of the girls ofParadise. While eating they will be waited on by 300 attendants, the food being served in dishes of gold, whereof 300 shall be set before him at once, containing each a different kind of food, and an inexhaustible supply of wine and liquors. The magnificence of the garments and gems is conformable to the delicacy of their diet. For they will be clothed in the richest silks and brocades, and adorned with bracelets of gold and silver, and crowns set with pearls, and will make use of silken carpets, couches, pillows, etc., and in order that they may enjoy all these pleasures,Godwill grant them perpetual youth, beauty, and vigour. Music and singing will also be ravishing and everlasting” (Wollaston, “Muhammed, His Life and Doctrines”).The Mohammedan doctrine ofpredestinationis equivalent tofatalism. TheybelieveinGod’sabsolute decree and predetermination both ofgoodand ofevil; viz., whatever has been or shall be in the world, whethergoodorbad, proceeds entirely from the Divine will, and is irrevocably fixed and recorded from alleternity.The possession and the exercise of our ownfree willis, accordingly, futile and useless. The absurdity of this doctrine was felt by later Mohammedantheologians, who sought in vain by various subtile distinctions to minimize it.MoralsIt is hardlynecessaryhere to emphasize the fact that theethicsof Islam are far inferior to those ofJudaismand even more inferior to those of theNew Testament. Furthermore, we cannot agree with Noldeke when he maintains that, although in many respects theethicsof Islam are not to be compared even with suchChristianityas prevailed, and still prevails, in the East, nevertheless, in other points, the newfaith— simple, robust, in the vigour of its youth — far surpassed the religion of theSyrianandEgyptianChristians, which was in a stagnating condition, and steadily sinking lower and lower into the depths of barbarism (op. cit., Wollaston, 71, 72). The history and the development, as well as the past and present religious, social, andethicalcondition of all theChristiannations and countries, no matter of whatsector school they may be, as compared with these of the various Mohammedan countries, in all ages, is a sufficient refutation of Noldeke’s assertion. That in theethicsof Islam there is a great deal to admire and to approve, is beyond dispute;but of originality or superiority, THERE IS NONE. What is reallygoodin Mohammedanethicsis either commonplace or borrowed from some otherreligions, whereas what is characteristic IS NEARLY ALWAYS IMPERFECT OR WICKED.",

Besides the alphabetical listing, there are indexes of terms, scripture references, and subjects.”I also direct the readers to this post where you will find the same reference: See alsoInfidels | Catholic Answers Encyclopedia. It can also be accessed here:Infidels. All emphasis will be mine.Infidels(Latin in, privative, and fidelis.)As in ecclesiastical language those who by baptism have received faith in Jesus Christ and have pledged Him their fidelity and called the faithful, so the name infidel is given to those who have not been baptized. The term applies not only to all who are ignorant of the true God, such as pagans of various kinds,but also to those who adore Him but do not recognize Jesus Christ, as Jews, Mohammedans; strictly speaking it may be used of catechumens also, though in early ages they were called Christians; for it is only through baptism that one can enter into the ranks of the faithful. Those however who have been baptized but do not belong to the Catholic Church, heretics and schismatics of divers confessionsare not called infidels but non-Catholics. The relation in which all these classes stand to the Catholic Church is not the same; in principle, those who have been baptizedare subjects of the Church and her children even though they be rebellious children; they are under her laws or, at least, are exempt from them only so far as pleases the Church. Infidels, on the contrary, are not members of the ecclesiastical society, according to the words of St. Paul: Quid mihi de his qui fortis sunt, judicare? (I Cor., v, 12); they are entirely exempt from the canon law;they need to be enlightened and converted, not punished. Needless to say, infidels do not belong to the supernatural state; if they receive supernatural graces from God, it is not through the channels established by Jesus Christ for Christians, but by a direct personal inspiration, for instance, the grace of conversion. But their condition is not morally bad; negative infidelity, says St. Thomas (II-II, q. x, a. 1), does not partake of the nature of sin, but rather of punishment,in the sense that ignorance of the Faith is a consequence of original sin. That is why the condemnation by the Church of proposition lxviii of Baius: Infidelits pure negativa, in his quibus Christus non et praedicatus,peccatum est (purely negative infidelity in those to whom Christ has not been preached is a sin), was fully justified.But it is different with regard to positive infidelity, which is a sin against faith, the most grievous of all sins, apostasy. Being endowed with reason, and subject to natural law, infidels are not excluded from the moral order; they can perform acts of natural virtue; and so the ecclesiastical authorities had to condemn proposition xxv of Baius which declared that: Omnia infidelium opera peccata sunt, et philosophorum virtutes vitia (all works of infidels are sinful, and all the virtues of the philosophers are vices; cf. St. Thomas, loc. cit., a. 4; Hurter, Theol. dogm., III, thes. cxxvi and cxxvii).Daily experience moreover proves incontestably that there are infidels who really religious, charitable, just, true to their word, upright in their business, and faithful to their family duties. One can say of them, as the Scriptures say of Cornelius the centurion, that their prayers and their alms are acceptable to God (Acts, x, 4). It was especially among such well-meaning infidels that the Church of Jesus grew up, and it is from their ranks that she gains her recruits at the present day in missionary lands.The Church, mindful of the order of the Saviour: Go, teach all nations (Matt., xxviii, 19), has always considered the preaching of the Gospel among the infidels and their conversion by her apostolic missionaries to be one of her principal duties. This is not the place to recall the history of the missions, from the laboursof St. Paul, the greatest of missionaries, and those who gave the light of faith to the Greek and Roman world, and those who converted the barbarian peoples, down through the ages when the phalanxes of religious men rushed to the conquest of the Orient, the Far East, and America, to the present-day pioneers of the religion of Jesus Christ; the multitude of heroes and martyrs and the harvest of souls that have been won to the true Faith. Doubtless, we still are far from having but one fold and one shepherd; nevertheless, there is not to-day a province or race of men so remote,but has not heard the name of Him by whom all men must be saved and has given children to the Church. The work of the missions is placed, as is well known, under the care and direction of the congregation of cardinals that bears the admirable name Da Propaganda Fide (for the propagation of the Faith), instituted by Gregory XV in 1622. Ever encouraged and developed by the popes, it is the directing body on whom the evangelical labourers in infidel lands depend. It sends them forth and grants them their powers, it established the prefectures Apostolic and the vicariates, and it is the tribunal to whose decision the missionaries submit their controversies, difficulties, and doubts.Thought there is a general obligation on the Church to toil for the conversion of infidels, yet it is not incumbent on any particular persons, unless on those priests charged with the care of souls who have infidels within their territory. For the distant fields of labour missionaries, priests, members of religious orders, both men and women, who voluntarily offer themselves for the apostolic work, are recruited in Catholic countries. Native Christians are not excluded from the ranks of the clergy, and it is a duty of the missionaries to provide themselves prudently with auxiliary workers in their missions.To draw the infidels to the Faith, the missionaries ought, like St. Paul, to make themselves all things to all men, adopt the customs of the country, acquire the native language, establish schools and charitable institutions, preach especially by their example, and show in their lives how the religion they have come to teach is to be practiced(cf. Instr. of the Prop. to the Vicars Apostolic of China, in the Collectanea S. C. de Prop. Fide, n. 328). They and their catechists are to instruct with zeal and patience to those who are anxious to know the true religion, admitting them to baptism after longer or shorter period of probation, as was done in the case of the catechumens in ancient times.But the conversion of infidels must be free and without compulsion, otherwise it will not be genuine and lasting(cap. 9, tit. vi, lib. V, de Judaeis). It cannot be denied that at various epochs, notably under Charlemagne and later in Spain,there were forced conversions, which may be explained, though not excused, by the custom of the age; but the Church was not responsible for them, as it has constantly taught that all conversions should be free. On several occasions it expressly forbade the baptism of Jews and infidels against their will, and even the baptism of children without their parents consent, unless they were in imminent danger of death(cf. Collect. cit., De subjecto baptismi). In the rite of administering baptism the Church still asks the questions: Quid petis ab Ecclesia Dei? Vis baptizari?Though ecclesiastical law does not affect the acts of infidels as such, yet the Church has to pass judgment on the validity of these acts and their juridical consequences when infidels come within the fold by baptism. No act of an infidel can have any value from the point of view of the spiritual society to which he does not belong; he is incapable by Divine law of receiving the sacraments, notably Holy orders (evidently we are not speaking here of a purely material reception); nor can he receive or exercise any ecclesiastical jurisdiction.The acts of infidels are to be considered in the light of natural law, to which they, like all men, are subject, and in accordance with the Divine law, in so far as it determines the secondary natural law. This applies principally to the case of matrimony.The marriage of infidels is valid as a contract under natural law, not as a sacrament, though at times this word has been applied to it(cf. Encycl. Arcanum);it is subject only to the impediments of natural law and, at times, to those of the civil law also, but it is not affected by the impediments of canon law. However the Church does not recognize polygamy as lawful among infidels; as to divorce strictly so called, it admits it only under the form of the Casus Apostoli, also known as the privilege of the Faith or the Pauline privilege; this consists in a convert being permitted to abandon his partner, who remains an infidel, if the latter refuse to continue the common life without endangering the faith of the convert(cf. DIVORCE, I, B, 1); under such circumstances the convert may marry a Catholic. As to acts which are prohibited or void in virtue of canon law alone, they are valid when performed by infidels; thus, the impediment of the remoter degrees of consanguinity and affinity, etc., does not affect the marriages of infidels. But the juridical consequences of the acts, performed by them when infidels,begin to exist at the moment of and in virtue of their baptism; consequently, a converted widower may not marry a relative of his late wife without dispensation; and again, a man who has had two wives before his conversion is a bigamist and therefore irregular.Most of the laws passed by the Church refer to the relations between its subjects and infidels in not only religious but also civil affairs.Speaking generally, the faithful are forbidden to take part in any religious rites, considered as such, of pagans, Mohammedans, or Jews, and all the more to practice them through a kind of survival of their primitive superstitions. If this prohibition is inspired not so much by a fear of the danger of perversion as by the law forbidding the faithful to communicate in sacris with non-Catholics,aversion to false religions and especially from idol worship justifies the rigor of the law. To mention but the principal acts, the faithful are forbidden to venerate idols, not only in their temples, but also in private houses, to contribute to the building or repairing of pagan temples or of mosques, to carve idols, to join in pagan sacrifices, to assist at Jewish circumcisions, to wear idolatrous images or objects having an acknowledged religious significance, so that the fact of wearing them is looked upon as an act of pagan worship, and finally to make use of superstitious and especially idolatrous practices in the acts of civil or domestic life. Some very delicate questions may arise in connection with the last prohibition; for instance, we may recall the celebrated controversy concerning the Chinese rites (see CHINA).On the other hand, it is not forbidden to enter temples and mosques out of mere curiosity if no act of religion be performed, or to eat food that has been offered to false gods, provided that this be not done in a temple or as a sacred repast, and that it be done without scandal; or to observe customs or perform acts which are not in themselves religious, even though pagans join superstitious practices to them. Not only is it not forbidden, but it is permissible and one might say obligatory to pray even publicly for infidel princes, in order that God may grant their subjects peace and prosperity; nothing is more conformable to the tradition of the Church; thus Catholics of the different rites in the Ottoman Empire pray for the sultan.In this place mention may be made of the ecclesiastical law forbidding the faithful to marry infidels, a prohibition which is now a diriment impediment, rendering a marriage null and void unless a dispensation has been obtained(see DISPARITY OF WORSHIP). It is easy to see that there is a real danger to the faith and religious life of the Catholic party in the intimacy of married life and in the difficulties in the way of a Christian education of the children;and, if that party be the wife, in the excessive authority of the husband and the inferior condition of the wife in infidel countries; consequently, this dispensation is granted only with difficulty and when the precautions dictated by prudence have been taken. The laws regulating the dealings between Catholics and infidels in civil life were inspired also by religious motives, the danger of perversion, and the high idea entertained in the ages of faith of the superiority of Christians to infidels. These regulations, of course, did not refer to all acts of civil life; moreover, they were not directed against all infidels indifferently, but only against Jews; at the present day they have fallen almost completely into desuetude.In the early Middle Ages, Jews were forbidden to have Christian slaves; the laws of the decretals forbade Christians to enter the service of Jews, or Christian women to act as their nurses or midwives; moreover, Christians when ill were not to have recourse to Jewish physicians. These measures may be useful in certain countries to-day and we find them renewed, at least as recommendations, by recent councils(Council of Gran, in 1858; Prague, in 1860; and Utrecht, in 1865).As for the Jews, they were ordinarily restricted to certain definite quarters of the towns into which they were admitted, and had to wear a dress by which they might be recognized. Modern legislation has given the Jews the same rights as other citizens and the intercourse between them and Catholics in civil life is no longer governed by ecclesiastical law.

And as for interfaith relations of our Church, one of the strongest bonds, perhaps, is the one that links you and me.“Orthodox Christians and Muslims co-exist in Russia but, by God’s mercy, our country has never known religious wars. We were brought up that way, and the same was true of the pre-revolutionary Russia – the tsars saw to it that no conflicts occurred between Orthodox Christians and Muslims. You know that there were Muslim military leaders at court, in the head of state’s entourage. That is, the Islamic Ummah, the Muslims, be it in times when they were subjects of the Russian Empire or citizens of the Soviet Union but especially nowadays constitute an essential factor in strengthening inter-ethnic peace in Russia, serving as a bridge that helps Russia develop its relations with the Islamic world and, of course, as a bridge between our two peoples.“Once again, I would like to emphasise your personal contribution. You have always been well-disposed towards the Orthodoxy, towards our people, and I could feel your good attitude towards me. You have always spoken frankly and cordially, with your words being in line with your actions at all times.“When it comes to diplomacy in a good sense of this word – not as an art of achieving one’s political goals by any means, but as an instrument intended to ensure the development of good relations among countries and nations – the diplomacy you engage in, with your talent and authority, certainly brings great benefit to our countries and peoples. I wholeheartedly thank you for that.“Friendship between our two countries and peoples, our two presidents’ policy and our countries’ economic, political and cultural cooperation – all these significant factors create a unique atmosphere in the relationship between Russia and your blessed country, as well as in our relations as religious leaders. I would like to reiterate that the relations between Muslims and Orthodox Christians in our two countries play an important role in strengthening inter-state ties.Therefore, by serving an important cause of establishing mutual understanding between people who believe in Godwe at the same time help strengthen inter-state relations and bonds between our two nations.“With all my heart, I wish prosperity to Azerbaijan and success to your remarkable leader, who is a really talented politician and a person of high, including political, culture. I would like to cordially thank you for the hospitality. I always feel this special cordiality when I meet with you, your colleagues and brothers here. I would like to assure you of my reciprocal warm feelings. Time and again, I wish help from above to you and all your relatives, friends and colleagues. May we all continue to work together in furthering Azerbaijan-Russia relations.”To conclude the meeting, Sheikh ul-Islam Allahshukur Pashazade and His Holiness Patriarch Kirill exchanged memorable gifts. (Emphasis mine)That’s not all. This next section is taken fromAddress by Patriarch KIRILL of Moscow and All Russia atmeeting of Russia-Islam Strategic Vision Group.On the 19th of May, 2023, His Holiness Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and All Rus’, who is making a Patriarchal visit to Tatarstan, took part in a meeting of Russia-Islam Strategic Vision Group held at the Kazan City Hall and addressed the audience.Address by Patriarch KIRILL of Moscow and All Russia at the meeting of Russia-Islam Strategic Vision GroupKazan, 18thMay 2023Dear Rustam Nurgaliyevich,Dear Muslim religious leaders,dear participants in the forum,I greet you with all my heart, happy to be here with you today, on the blessed Kazan land, and take part in this important meeting.Russia has long-standing relations with the Muslim world. Since the Russia-Islam Strategic Vision Group was set up, the Russian Orthodox Church has been actively engaging in its work.Our meeting takes place in Kazan. The capital of Tatarstan, perhaps like no other place in Russia, is a visual symbol of fruitful cooperation between people of different faiths for the good of their country and nation. In this city, mosques stand next to churches; Muslim and Orthodox theology is flourishing. Here Christians and Muslims work together for the benefit of the entire society.I would like to thank esteemed Rustam Nurgaliyevich Minnikhanov, head of the Republic of Tatarstan, for organising this important event. Traditionally, the head of the Kazan Metropolia acts as representative of the Russian Church in the Russia-Islam Strategic Vision Group. Metropolitan Feofan of blessed memory did much in that capacity, and now his successor, Metropolitan Kirill of Kazan and Tatarstan, who is present here, is one of the Group members.As we look at what is going on in the world, we cannot but see that Western interference in the affairs of other countries, in particular, the Middle East has had sorrowful consequences. Less than a month ago it was the 10thanniversary of the abduction of two metropolitans of Aleppo in Syria. Metropolitans Paul of the Orthodox Church of Antioch and Mar Gregorios Yohanna were kidnapped by terrorists and we still do not know what happened to those remarkable religious leaders. The so-called “Arab Spring” only brought sorrow and countless tribulations to people of those countries, the majority of them Muslims. The Western forces were trying to use a religious factor to destroy those countries’ statehood, to sow enmity and provoke divisions on religious grounds in society. It resulted in an outburst of brutality and violence, and a surge in terror attacks committed under religious slogans. Our own history and the history of other countries clearly show that such approach is inadmissible. We – Christians and Muslims – have to stand against extremism, and in this regard the work of the Russia-Islam Strategic Vision Group is of particular value and significance.For decades, the Moscow Patriarchate has been maintaining brotherly relations with Islamic leaders and organisations. In recent years, these contacts have intensified considerably. It is gratifying to note that every such meeting is held in the atmosphere of mutual understanding. The Department for External Church Relations of the Moscow Patriarchate has been taking part in this work for many years. In November 2018, the Expert Council under the Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia for Cooperation with the Islamic World was established. Not long ago, we met with the Secretary General of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and the head of the Muslim World League. This February, Russian and Iranian theologians held their 12thmeeting in Moscow, continuing the dialogue that began more than 25 years ago.Almost 25 years ago the Interreligious Council of Russia was established.MY BROTHERS, leaders of the Islamic and Judaic communities in Russia, and I founded it in December 1998. The Council helps the leaders of traditional religions –Orthodoxy, Islam, Judaism AND BUDDHISM– to coordinate their work, exchange views on various topical issues and appeal to authorities and society on behalf of our faithful. The Patriarch is the Honorary Chairman of this organisation. Metropolitan Anthony of Volokolamsk represents Orthodox Christians in the Council’s Presidium. Muslims are represented by the heads of the major Muslims’ Spiritual Boards, including the Mufti of Tatarstan and the head of the Muslim Coordinating Centre for the North Caucasus.Why does the Russian Orthodox Church maintain such close relations with the Muslim Ummah in and outside Russia?Because our fundamental values are alike. Orthodox Christians and Muslims strive to act according to God’s will. It is an essential principle of OUR life. We are conservative in a good way, for Orthodox Christians and Muslims resolutely reject any attempts to make sin a social norm. For us the unnatural confusion of the sexes and the so-called LGBT ideology are absolutely unacceptable.We seek to preserve traditional, God-commanded form of family. Whatever is used to justify the egoistic attitude to people and to the world, it is evident that it substitutes serving God for serving one’s passions, which turns a person into a prisoner of his or her own vices.Faithful to our spiritual ideals, we can work together in opposing the sophisticated propaganda of individualism and the worship of the human being.Orthodox Christians and Muslims are called to uphold their moral values, live up to the ideals of good, love, mercy, justice and mutual respect.WE, Christians and Muslims, know and confess that God is the true Creator of the world and the Only Lawmaker. Where God is forgotten, there evil reigns.A great Russian writer whose influence on our self-awareness was enormous – Fyodor Dostoevsky – expressed this simple but profound idea: If there is now God, then everything is permitted. “If there is no God, then I am god,” says one of the characters, Alexei Kirillov, in his novelDemons. The origin of such thought pattern goes back to the Renaissance period in the European history. However, misinterpreted, freedom made humans slaves of their own passions. And what today is coming to various countries under the guise of freedom is destruction and chaos.I have stated this many times and will say it again – the 21st century’s main challenge comes from the godless secular world and is posed to the traditional system of values rooted in religion. To oppose it, we need to ensure consolidation of those forces in society that are committed to their traditions. If we do not wish to see the victory of evil and the development of a universal cult of sin and egoism, then we should give to this challenge a spiritual rebuff,for our joint efforts can save the world from self-destruction. In this respect Christians and Muslims have sufficient potential – religious, cultural, human, intellectual and economic.To conclude my speech, I would like to express hope that Russia and the Islamic world will develop and broaden their cooperation.The Russian Orthodox Church, which represents the interests of millions of its faithful, is ready TO PROMOTE IT in all possible ways and to exchange experience and knowledge. I believe that today, amid the crisis in international relations, a new possibility is unfolding for us to influence the global agenda so that preservation of the intransient moral values could become one of its primary concerns.I wish you all successful work.Thank you for your attention. (Emphasis mine)So here we have the Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church claiming that Muslims and Eastern Orthodox serve the same true God and seek to carry out his will. The Patriarch even calls the religious leaders of the Muslim and Jewish communities his brothers.",

The document can be accessed at the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America website:Social Ethos Document. Here is thePDF Version.The readers will see that according to this document the Greek or Eastern Orthodox (EO) do believe and affirm that Muslims and Jews are worshiping the same God as acknowledged by the EO. In fact, the document goes so far as to say that all the people of the world are worshiping the same God and that there are truths in all these religions including those from India and China, which most definitely include Hinduism and Buddhism!These references all come from the section titled,I. Ecumenical Relations and Relations with Other FaithsLet us pray for the unity of allAll emphasis will be mine.§55 God is Father of all the families of the heavens and the earth. God’s Logos pervades all things, and all things were created through his Logos. God’s Spirit is everywhere, enlightening and enlivening all of reality. Thus creation universally declares the power, wisdom, and grace of its maker, while at all times and in all places God is present to those who seek the truth. The Orthodox Church exists as the concrete reality of Christ’s mystical body in time,  always bearing witness tothe light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ. It is for this reason that the Church not only reaches out and witnesses to Orthodoxy to various Christian confessions, with whom the Orthodox Church enjoys historic dialogue, but also reaches outward to meet non-Christian religions and faith communities that are open to the truth and the call of God.In this regard, it also affirms,and has done so since the earliest centuries of the faith, that God’s Logos shines forth in the whole frame of the created world and speaks to all hearts in the still small voice of conscience, and that wherever truth is revered the Spirit of God is at work. St. Justin Martyr, for instance, declared that knowledge of God’s Logos had been imparted by God not only to the children of Israel,but to the Greek philosophers who had never known Christ, and to all peoples, inasmuch as seeds of the eternal Logos have been planted in all human beings; thus, he says, all who have lived in harmony with this Logosare already in some sense Christians, while Christians may claim as their own any and every truth known to the nations of the earth by God’s inspiration.50According to St. Maximus the Confessor, the primordiallogoiunderlying and indwelling all things reside in the one Logos of God, and find their historical center in Christ.51The Church knows, moreover, that the full mystery of God’s Logos transcends human comprehension,and communicates itself in ways too numerous and wonderful to calculate or conceive. The Church thus seeks dialogue with other religious traditions not out of any desire to alter the deposit of its faith, much less out of any anxiety regarding that deposit’s sufficiency, but out of a reverent love for all who seek God and his goodness, and in a firm certitudethat God has left no people without a share in the knowledge of his glory and grace. This is not to deny, of course, that there are many irreconcilable differences between the Church’s understanding of the truth and that of other religious traditions, and it certainly has no desire to obscure this reality. It seeks neither to make compromises regarding her own essential beliefsnor condescendingly to treat those of other faiths as inconsequential. At the same time, knowing that God reveals himself in countless ways and with boundless inventiveness,the Church enters into dialogue with other faiths prepared to be amazed and delighted by the variety and beauty of God’s generous manifestations of divine goodness, grace, and wisdom among all peoples.§56 Though the Orthodox Church seeks deeper bonds of amity with all faiths, it recognizes her unique responsibility with regard to the other two “peoples of the book,” the Abrahamic traditions of Islam and Judaism, with which it has longstanding dialogues and alongside which it has lived for millennia. Therefore,the Church can and does engage the beauty and spiritual truths of Islam in all its multiple traditions, acknowledging points of contact with it especially in its affirmation of the Virgin Birth (Quran 3:47, 19:16-21, 21:91) and its recognition of Jesus as the Messiah, Messenger, Word, and Spirit of God (4:171). Although Orthodoxy cannot agree with Islam in its rejection of the Incarnation and of God as Trinity, it is nevertheless able to pursue meaningful dialogue with all parts of the Islamic Ummah regarding the proper understanding of these central Christian teachings. It believes that the common roots of Christianity and Islam in the Middle East,the common affirmation of the message of the unity of God, as well as the common recognition of the holiness and truth of God’s Word and his Prophets, the importance of prayer and ascesis, as well as the struggle to discern the will of God in all things, invite Islam and Orthodoxy to enter into an intimate conversation for the advancement of peace and understanding among all peoples.§57 As to Judaism, when the eternal Son of God became human he became incarnate as a Jew, born within the body of Israel, an heir to God’s covenants with his chosen people. He came in fulfillment of God’s saving promises to his people, as the Messiah of Israel. The first blood he shed for the redemption of the world was exacted on the day of his circumcision; his first confession before the world concerning the justice of God was in the synagogue, as was the first declaration of his mission to the world (Luke 4:18–21); his ministry resumed the language of the great prophets of Israel; and he was executed by a pagan authority under the title “King of the Jews.” It was to Israel that God declared himself as The One Who Is, to Israel that God gave the Law as a language of love and communion, with Israel that God established an everlasting covenant, and to Israel that he proclaimed, “I will bless those who bless you and curse those who curse you, and in you shall all the families of the earth be blessed” (Genesis 12:3). As the Apostle Paul emphasized, Christians are saved in Christ only in being grafted like wild olive branches into the cultivated olive tree of Israel, and the branches do not support—but rather are supported by—the root (Romans 11:16–24). Orthodox Christians look to the Jewish communities throughout the world not merely as to practitioners of another creed,but as to, in some sense, their spiritual elders in the history of God’s saving revelations, and as to the guardians of that precious inheritance that is the first full manifestation of God’s saving presence in history. It is, sadly, necessary to state these things with a special emphasis at this moment. In recent years, we have witnessed a revival in many quarters of the Western world of the most insidious ideologies of national, religious, and even racial identity in general, and of anti-Semitic movements in particular. Bigotry and violence against Jews have long been a conspicuous evil of the cultures of Christendom; the greatest systematic campaign of mass murder and attempted genocide in European history was undertaken against the Jews of Europe; and—while some Orthodox clergy and laity demonstrated exceptional generosity and even sacrificial compassion to their Jewish brothers and sisters, earning from them the honorific “righteous among the nations”—other historically Orthodox nations have dark histories of anti-Semitic violence and oppression. For all these evils, Christians must seek God’s forgiveness. In expiation for those crimes against the Jewish peoplespecifically committed in Orthodox lands, the Church seeks both God’s forgiveness as well as a deeper relation of love and regard with Jewish communities and the Jewish faith.§58 The story of other non-Orthodox Christian religious traditions is not yet finished, and Orthodoxy affirms that like other non-Orthodox Christian bodies they only find their coherence and clarity within the Orthodox Church.As for other religions, the Orthodox Church takes encouragement from the words of the Apostle Paul to the Athenians at the Areopagus: “What therefore you worship as unknown, this I proclaim to you”(Acts 17:23). From this the Church is given license to proclaimthat the true God in whom all humanity lives and moves and has its beingis worshipped by peoples everywhere, Christian and non-Christian alike. And this makes her only more eager to make all persons and peoples aware that the face of this one true God shines forth unobscured in the face of Jesus Christ. Moreover, the Church—illumined by that radiance—enters into dialogue with other faiths fully prepared to be instructed by many of their own speculative, cultural, and spiritual achievements. It may be that, just as the Church of the early centuries profited fromand in time baptized many of the philosophical, religious, and cultural riches of pre-Christian Europe, Asia Minor, and the Near East, so too may it now discover new ways of articulating the deposit of faith or new ways of thinking about its cultural expressions and conceptual formsby exposure to, say, the great philosophies and faiths OF INDIA, or to the traditions OF CHINA and the greater FAR EAST, or to the spiritual experiences of tribal peoples throughout the world, and so on. Again, as Justin Martyr insisted, whatsoever is true and godly is welcome to us, for the Logos is everywhere and shines forth in all places.50 Justin, FirstApology46. PG6.397B. AndSecond Apology8, 10, and 13. PG 6.457A, 460B, and 465B.51 Maximus,Ambiguum7. PG 91.1081C. SeeOn Difficulties in the Church Fathers, vol. 1, 75–141.And this is what the document states in respect to the other ancient Apostolic Churches:§52 Though visible sacramental unity among all Christians is at present only a remote hope, nothing lies beyond the power of God’s Spirit, and the Church cannot relent in her labors to achieve a final reunion of all who come together in Christ’s name. Until that day, so long as their hearts and minds are open to the promptings of God’s Word and Spirit, Christians of all communions can meet together in love and work together for the transformation of the world. In particular, they can cooperate with one another in works of charity, thereby making God’s love manifest to the world, and in efforts to advance social and civil justice, thereby proclaiming God’s righteousness and peace to all peoples. Moreover, even if they cannot as yet enjoy perfect communion in the full sacramental life of the Church, all Christians are called by their baptism in the Holy Trinity to gather together in prayer, to repent of past misunderstandings and offences against their brothers and sisters, and to love one another as fellow servants and heirs of the Kingdom of God.By this, all shall know that you are my disciples: if you have love for one another(John 13:35).§53 The Orthodox Church enjoys especially close relationswith thosecommunions that are directly descended from the ancient Apostolic Churchand that share something like her understanding of the apostolic charism of episcopal succession and something like her sacramental theology: the ancient churches of Egypt and Ethiopia, of Armenia,of the Assyrian tradition, of Canterbury, and of Rome. Thus, the Church has important bilateral dialogues with the Roman Catholic Church and the Anglican Communion, and it prays that these dialogues may bear fruit in a complete unity with the Church.But all Christian communions are her kin and her love for all is equally unqualified. For more than a century, then, the Orthodox Church has played a leading role in the movement towards Christian unity,out of obedience to our Lord’s supplication and exhortationthat all may be one(John 17:21).The Ecumenical Patriarchate, in particular, has been at the forefront of the Orthodox engagement with Christians of other communions, and has remained a steadfast participant in numerous bilateral and multi-lateral dialogues with other major Christian churches.The Ecumenical Patriarchate was, in fact, one of the founding members of the World Council of Churches, and has continuously maintained an official representative presence at that council’s central offices.§54 In short, the Church is dedicated to a sustained dialogue with other Christians. Dialogue, in the Orthodox understanding, is essentially and primordially a reflection of the dialogue between God and humanity: it is initiated by God and conducted through the divine Logos (dia-logos), our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Pervading all human life, dialogue takes place in all our encounters, personal, social, or political, and must always be extended to those who adhere to religions different from ours. And in all our connections and relationships, the Word of God is mystically present, ever guiding our exchange of words and ideas towards a spiritual union of hearts in him. Naturally, the Orthodox Church considers itself responsible always to interpret other traditions and perspectives in terms of what was revealed to it by God. In so doing, it is open towhatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is pleasing, whatever is commendable(Philippians 4:8), and is ready to rejoice whenever it discovers these in her partners of dialogue. Our commitment to ecumenical relations with other Christian confessions reflects this openness to all who sincerely seek the truth as the incarnate Logos, Jesus Christ, and who remain true to their conscience, even while we continue to bear witness to the fullness of the Christian faith in the Orthodox Church. Moreover, the Church can stand with other Christians in this way not only out of solidarity in light of a shared history and moral vision,but also because such Christian groups, through their Trinitarian baptism and confession of the faith of the Councils, profess and share many aspects of Orthodox teaching and tradition.The readers should pay careful attention to the document unashamedly highlighting the fact that the Ecumenical Patriarchate of the EO was one of the founding members of the World Council of Churches!",

All emphasis will be mine.Address by His All-Holiness Ecumenical PatriarchBartholomewEsteemed religious leaders, venerable scholars, beloved brothers and sisters,As the golden sun rises over this ancient city, a place where history paints an intricate tableau of religious, cultural, and ethnic pluralism, we gather with purpose and hope. With each exchange of dialogue and every gesture of partnership, we lay down a foundation, connecting centuries of shared history, culture, and values.Historically, the intertwining threads of Christianity and Islam have woven stories of shared existence, bearing testimony to ages of coexistence. As inheritors of this rich legacy, we are summoned today to not only reminisce about our shared past, but to forge ahead, uniting in the face of present-day challenges.At the monumental Holy and Great Council of the Orthodox Church on the island of Crete in 2016, we were reminded: “The Church lives not for herself. She offers herself for the whole of humanity in order to raise up and renew the world into new heavens and a new earth” (Holy and Great Council, 2016). This profound message transcends boundaries, beckoning all of humankind to unite for the greater good.Both Christianity and Islam, SPIRITUAL LEGACIES OF ABRAHAM, provide a reservoir of teachings that advocate peace, mutual respect, and stewardship of God’s creation. The sacred Psalmist beautifully captures the spirit of unity, expressing, “Behold, how good and pleasant it is when brothers dwell in unity!” (Psalms 133:1). Complementing this sentiment, the poetic genius Al-Mutanabbi professes, “He who does not have forbearance, has nothing.” These words shine as guiding stars, leading us on a path to shared comprehension.St. Augustine of Hippo stated that “Peace is the tranquility of order.”This understanding finds echoes in the philosophical depths of Islamic tradition, with Al-Farabi asserting that a truly virtuous society fosters inner peace and common good. Such sagacious teachings offer a foundation upon which we can build a shared future.Now, more than ever, our world stands at a pivotal crossroads. Our Earth, which has cradled civilizations and nurtured cultures, is beset with unprecedented perils. Environmental crises, from escalating climate events to the diminishing diversity of life, issue a pressing call to arms for united action. We have consistently reiterated, “The earth does not belong to us. It is a gift, and we have the moral obligation to respect and preserve it for future generations” (Bartholomew, 2018).As faith leaders and communities, we are uniquely positioned to respond to this call. Our scriptures, traditions, and histories are replete with teachings that emphasize our duty toward the environment. It’s time we plunged deep into these repositories of wisdom to spearhead a collective, faith-based environmental movement.Moreover, dialogue must manifest in concrete actions. Words are but the beginning; the real testament of our commitment will be the projects we initiate, the communities we uplift, and the environment we safeguard. Through initiatives grounded in our shared values, we can inspire transformation on both individual and collective levels.To realize the vision of “One Earth, One Family, One Future,” we must transcend mere tolerance. True dialogue entails deep respect, mutual understanding, and collective action. Our scriptures offer countless narratives that champion unity, respect, and cooperation. By immersing ourselves in these narratives, we can draw inspiration for our common journey.Our Earth, a shared sanctuary, has sheltered countless generations, each adding its own unique chapter to the saga of humanity. Our generation stands at an epochal moment, endowed with the responsibility to chart a course that guarantees peace, prosperity, and ecological balance for those yet to come.As we navigate the challenges of the present, let our actions be guided by the timeless wisdom of our faith traditions. Let this conference be more than a mere congregation of individuals. Let it be a symphony of voices, ideas, and aspirations in order to create a transformative global movement. A movement that, guided by the words of St. Paul, embodies the spirit of “God has called us to peace” (1 Corinthians 7:15).Let us march forth with a renewed sense of purpose, unity, and determination. Let the echoes of our dialogue reverberate through time, inspiring future generations to further strengthen and advance our fellowship. Let this historical city of myriad cultures bear witness to our pledge today: a pledge to work together, shoulder to shoulder, in shaping a world that celebrates diversity, fosters unity, and safeguards our shared Earthlyoikos.May God’s infinite blessings be a guiding light on our path, fortifying our endeavors and filling our hearts with love, compassion, and hope!Works Cited:Bartholomew. “Message for the Day of Prayer for the Protection of Creation.”Ecumenical Patriarchate, 2018.Holy and Great Council of the Orthodox Church. “The Mission of the Orthodox Church in Today’s World.” Crete, 2016.The Holy Bible, English Standard Version (ESV).

Timothy I (AD 780-823) was the Patriarch of the Assyrian Church of the East who made an apology for the Christian faith to the third Abbasid Caliph Mahdi.The brilliance of the Patriarch can be seen from the fact that though he praises Muhammad before the caliph, he made sure to never call him a prophet. Instead, he simply affirmed that Muhammad walked in the path of the prophets. All emphasis will be mineThe Questions and Answers of the Second Day.The next1day I had an audience of his Majesty. Such audiences had constantly taken place previously, sometimes for the affairs of the State, and some other times for the love of wisdom and learning which was burning in the soul of his Majesty. He is a lovable man, and loves also learning when he finds it in other people, and on this account he directed against me the weight of his objections, whenever necessary. After I had paid to him my usual respects as King of Kings, he began to address me and converse with me not in a harsh and haughty tone, since harshness and haughtiness are remote from his soul, but in a sweet and benevolent way.And our King of Kings said to me: “O Catholicos, did you bring a Gospel with you, as 1 had asked you?” — And I replied to his exalted Majesty: “1 have brought one, O our victorious and God-loving King.” — And our victorious Sovereign said to me: “Who gave you this Book?” — And I replied to him: “It is the Word of God that gave us the Gospel, O our God-loving King.” — And our King said: “Was it not written -by four Apostles?”2And I replied to him: “It was written by four Apostles, as our King has said, but not out of their own heads, but out of what they heard and learned from the Word-God. If then the Gospel was written by the Apostles, and if the Apostles simply wrote what they heard and learned from the Word-God, the Gospel has, therefore, been given in reality by the Word-God. Similarly, the Torah was written by Moses, but since Moses heard and learned it from an angel, and the angel heard and learned it from God, we assert that the Torah was given by God and not by Moses.“In the same way also the Muslims say that they have received the Kur’an from Muhammad, but since Muhammad received knowledge and writing from an angel, they, therefore, affirm that the Book that was divulged through him was not Muhammad’s or the angel’s but God’s. So also we Christians believe that although the Gospel was given to us by the Apostles, it was not given as from them but as from God, His Word and His Spirit. Further, the letters and official documents1of your Majesty are written by the hands of scribes and clerks, but they are not said to be those of scribes, but those of your Majesty, and of the Commander of the Faithful.”And our gracious and wise King said to me: “What do you say about Muhammad?” — And I replied to his Majesty: “Muhammad is worthy of all praise, by all reasonable people, O my Sovereign.He walked in the path of the prophets, and trod in the track of the lovers of God. All the prophets taught the doctrine of one God,and since Muhammad taught the doctrine of the unity of God, he walked, therefore, in the path of the prophets. Further, all the prophets drove men away from bad works, and brought them nearer to good works, and since Muhammad drove his people away from bad works and brought them nearer to the good ones,he walked, therefore, in the path of the prophets. Again, all the prophets separated men from idolatry and polytheism, and attached them to God and to His cult, and since Muhammad separated his people from idolatry and polytheism,and attached them to the cult and the knowledge of one God, beside whom there is no other God, it is obvious that he walked in the path of the prophets. Finally Muhammad taught, about God, His Word and His Spirit, and since all the prophets had prophesied about God, His Word and His Spirit,Muhammad walked, therefore, in the path of all the prophets.“Who will not praise, honour and exalt the one who not only fought for God in words, but showed also his zeal for Him in the sword?As Moses did with the Children of Israel when he saw that they had fashioned a golden calf which they worshipped, and killed all of those who were worshipping it,so also Muhammad evinced an ardent zeal towards God, and loved and honoured Him more than his own soul, his people and his relatives. He praised, honoured and exalted those who worshipped God with him, and promised them kingdom, praise and honour from God, both in this world and in the world to come in the Garden.2But those who worshipped idols and not God he fought and opposed, and showed to them the torments of hell and of the fire which is never quenched and in which all evildoers burn eternally.“And what Abraham, that friend and beloved of God, did in turning his face from idols and from his kinsmen, and looking only towards one God and becoming the preacher of one God to other peoples,this also Muhammad did. He turned his face from idols and their worshippers, whether those idols were those of his own kinsmen or of strangers, and he honoured and worshipped only one God. Because of this God honoured him exceedingly and brought low1before his feet two powerful kingdoms which roared in the world like a lion and made the voice of their authority heard in all the earth that is below heaven like thunder, viz: the Kingdom of the Persians and that of the Romans. The former kingdom, that is to say the Kingdom of the Persians, worshipped the creatures instead of the Creator, and the latter,that is to say the Kingdom of the Romans, attributed suffering and death in the flesh to the one who cannot suffer and die in any way and through any process.2He further extended the power of his authority through the Commander of the Faithful and his children from east to west, and from north to south. Who will not praise, O our victorious King, the one whom God has praised, and will not weave a crown of glory and majesty to the one whom God has glorified and exalted?These and similar things I and all God-lovers utter about Muhammad, O my sovereign.”And our King said to me: “You should, therefore, accept the words of the Prophet.” — And I replied to his gracious Majesty: “Which words of his our victorious King believes that I must accept?” — And our King said to me: “That God is one and that there is no other one besides Him.” — And I replied: “This belief in one God, O my Sovereign, I have learned from the Torah, from the Prophets and from the Gospel. I stand by it and shall die in it.” — And our victorious King said to me: “You believe in one God, as you said, but one in three.” — And I answered his sentence: “I do not deny that I believe in one God in three, and three in one, but not in three different Godheads, however, but in the persons of God’s Word and His Spirit. I believe that these three constitute one God, not in their person but in their nature. 1 have shown how in my previous words.”",

He did this three times.Then those who were set to do the burying take the box up on their arms and walk further down. All the rest of them, with the Tasimanes, returned home. As I was sitting there I asked whether anyone could speak both languages that I needed. There was somebody, whom I asked to say TO THE TURKS [Muslims] on my behalf that what they had performed outside there I thought it was good, “for you addressed yourselves to God – to whom else? – for the deceased one. I wanted, however, to know what was that you exclaimed to God?” Tasimanes using the same interpreter said that he would explain: “We asked for forgiveness from God for the deceased, for his own sins committed in his soul.” Retorting myself I said, “Very well, but the judge is merciful, indeed, and dispenses mercy; and he who will come as judge of every race of men, even according to you, is Christ. You must be addressing, therefore, the prayers and the exclamations to Him. Thus you, too, invoke him as God, as we do, who believe that as an inborn Word of His he is indivisible from the Father; for there was no time when God was without reason or without the natural word.” (Source: Saint Gregory Palamas,Littera & Dialexis Patrologia Migne–PG, CL, COL. DCCCVIII)Notice how this great saint argues that the Muslims do indeed believe in the same God, and not different one. He then sets forth to prove that Jesus is indivisible from this God whom the Turks worship since is the Word of the Father. St. Gregory could not argue this way if he actually thought that the Muslim god was different from the God he professed and worshiped.",

Then everything was illuminated for me, and I could recognize everything. He said: Muhammad! I said: At Thy service, my Lord. He said: What do these high angels contend about? I said: In regard to expiations. He said: What are these? I said: Going on foot to join congregational prayers, sitting in the mosques after the prayers, performing ablution well despite difficulties. He again said: Then what do they contend? I said: In regard to the ranks. He said: What are these? I said: Providing of food, speaking gently, observing the prayer when the people are asleep. He again said to me: Beg (Your Lord) and say: O Allah, I beg of Thee (power) to do good deeds, and abandon abominable deeds, to love the poor, that Thou forgive me and show mercy to me and when Thou intendst to put people to trial Thou causes me to die unblemished and I beg of Thee Thy love and the love of one who loves Thee and the love for the deed which brings me near to Thy love. Allah’s Messenger said: It is a truth, so learn it and teach it.Transmitted by Ahmad, Tirmidhi, who said: This is a HASAN SAHIH hadith, and I asked Muhammad ibn Isma’il about this hadith, and he said: It is a SAHIH hadith. (Alim.orghttp://www.alim.org/library/hadith/TIR/245; capital and underline emphasis mine)Here’s another version of the foregoing narrative:Jami` at-TirmidhiChapters on TafsirNarrated Mu’adh bin Jabal:“One morning, the Messenger of Allah was prevented from coming to us for Salat As-Subh, until we were just about to look for the eye of the sun (meaning sunrise). Then he came out quickly, had the Salat prepared for. The Messenger of Allah performed the Salat, and he performed his Salat in a relatively quick manner. When he said the Salam, he called aloud with his voice saying to us: ‘Stay in your rows as you are.’ Then he turned coming near to us, then he said: ‘I am going to narrate to you what kept me from you this morning: I got up during the night, I performed Wudu and prayed as much as I was able to, and I dozed off during my Salat, and fell deep asleep. Then I SAW MY LORD, Blessed and Most High, IN THE BEST OF APPEARANCES. He said: ‘O Muhammad!’ I said: ‘My Lord here I am my Lord!’ He said: ‘What is it that the most exalted group busy themselves with?’ I said: ‘I do not know Lord.’ And He said it three times.” He said: “So I saw Him place HIS PALM between my shoulders, and I sensed the coolness of HIS FINGERTIPS between my breast. Then everything was disclosed for me, and I became aware. So He said: ‘O Muhammad!’ I said: ‘Here I am my Lord!’ He said: ‘What is it that the most exalted group busy themselves with?’ I said: ‘In the acts that atone.’ He said: ‘And what are they?’ I said: ‘The footsteps to the congregation, the gatherings in the Masajid after the Salat, Isbagh Al-Wudu during difficulties.’ He said: ‘Then what else?’ I said: ‘Feeding others, being lenient in speech, and Salat during the night while the people are sleeping.’ He said: ‘Ask.’ I said: ‘O Allah! I ask of you the do of good deeds, avoid the evil deeds, loving the poor, and that You forgive me, and have mercy upon me. And when You have willed Fitnah in the people, then take me without the Fitnah. And I ask You for Your love, the love of whomever You love, and the of the deeds that bring one nearer to Your love.’” The Messenger of Allah said: “Indeed it is true, so study it and learn it.”Grade: Hasan(Darussalam)English reference: Vol. 5, Book 44, Hadith 3235Arabic reference: Book 47, Hadith 3543 (sunnah.comhttps://sunnah.com/urn/642690; capital emphasis mine)This report is also found in another hadith collection:4 Prayer(8c) Chapter: Mosques and places of Prayer – Section 3Mu’adh b. Jabal said: God’s Messenger was detained one morning from observing the prayer with us till the sun had almost appeared over the horizon. He then came cut quickly, and when the iqama had been uttered he conducted the prayer in a shortened form; then when he had given the salutation he called out to us saying, “Keep to your rows as you were.” Then turning to us he said, “I shall tell you what detained me from you this morning. I got up during the night, performed ablution, and prayed what I could; but during my prayer I dozed and was overcome,and there and then I saw my Lord in the most beautiful form. He addressed me by name, and when I replied, ‘At Thy service, my Lord,’ He asked, ‘What do the angels near My presence dispute about?’ and I replied that I did not know. He asked it three times.Then I saw Him put the palm of His hand between my shoulder-blades, so that I experienced the coolness of His fingers between my nipplesso everything became clear to me and I attained knowledge. He then addressed me by name, and when I replied, ‘At Thy service, my Lord,’ He asked, ‘What do the angels near My presence dispute about?’ I replied, ‘Expiation.’ He asked what they were, and I replied, ‘Walking on foot to the congregational prayers, sitting in the mosques after the prayers are over, and performing complete ablution in difficult circumstances. He asked what next they disputed about, and when I said it was about degrees, He asked what they were and I replied, ‘Providing food, speaking gently, and praying at night when people are asleep.’ He then told me to make a request, and I said, ‘O God, I ask Thee for power to do good things and abandon objectionable things, for love towards the poor, that Thou shouldest forgive me and show mercy to me, and that when Thou intendest to test any people Thou wilt take me to Thyself without being led astray. And I ask for Thy love, the love of those who love Thee, and a love of doing things which will bring me near to Thy love.’” Then God’s Messenger said, “It is true, so study it and learn it.”Ahmad and Tirmidhi transmitted it, and Tirmidhi said, “This is ahasansahih tradition.I asked Muhammad b. Isma’il (AL-BUKHARI) about this tradition, and he said it is ASAHIHTRADITION.”Reference: Mishkat al-Masabih 748In-book reference: Book 4, Hadith 176 (sunnah.comhttps://sunnah.com/mishkat:748; emphasis mine)If this weren’t shocking enough, other versions state that Allah appeared as a beautiful beardless young man with short curly hair!“I saw my Lord in the most beautiful form like a youthwith abundant hair.” (al-Daraqutni,Kitab al-Ru’ya, 332-333; 356-357; similar reports from Umm al-Tufayl, Anas b. Malik, Mu’adh b. ‘Afra, Ibn ‘Umar, ‘A’isha, Ibn ‘Abbas; Reported by Tabarani; Ibn Abi ‘Asim; al-Bayhaqi; al-Suyuti; al-Haythami; Ibn ‘Adi, al-Baghdadi)I saw my Lord in the form ofa young man, beardless (amrad) with short curly hair(ja’d) and clothed in a red garment. (Narrated by Ahmad b. Hanbal in Tabarani; AUTHENTICATED BY AHMAD B. HANBAL in Creed 3 citingisnad, ‘Abd al-Samad b. Yahya inTabaqat al-Hanabila, 1:218, al-Marrudhi (d. 888) inTabaqat, 3:81, Ibn ‘Aqil in Makdisi,Ibn ‘Aqil, 130; Ibn ‘Adi al-Qattan,al-Kamil fi du’afa’ al-rijal, 3:49-50, al-Daraqutni,Kitab al-Ru’ya, 332-333, 356-357; al-Tabarani,al-Mu’jam al-Kabir, 25:143; SAHIH BY ABU L-HASAN B. BASHSHAR in Ibn Abi Ya’la,Tabaqat, 2:59; Abu Ya’la,al-Muta’mad, 85; ACCEPTED BY IBN TAYMIYYA inBayan Tablis al-Jahmiyya, 7:192-198, 290)Here’s what one of sunni Islam’s greatest hadith scholars said about the aforementioned report:Ahmad b. Hanbal said about the abovehadith: “Report it because the‘ulamahave reported it.” (‘Abd al-Samad b. Yahya reported inTabaqat al-Hanabila, 1:218)In case the readers are unaware, ibn Hanbal was not only a compiler of hadiths, whose massive collection of narrations is calledMusnad Ahmad, he even has a school of Islamic jurisprudence (madhab) named after him.There’s more:The Prophet saw Allah before deathas is the doctrine of the majority ofAh al-Sunnathus related from al-Nawawi by al-Qari. The evidence for this is the hadith of Ibn ‘Abbas whereby the Prophet said: “I saw my Lord” (ra’aytu rabbi). Ibn Kathir cited it in his commentary on Sura al-Najm and declared its chain sound, but considered it part of the hadith of the dream cited below. Ibn Qayyim [see excerpt below] relates that Imam Ahmad considered such sight to be in the Prophet’s sleep but remains a true sight – as the dreams of Prophets are true – and that some of the Imam’s companions mistakenly attributed to him the position that the Prophet saw his Lord “with the eyes of his head.”Al-Bayhaqi also narrated the hadith “I saw my Lord” inal-Asma’ wa al-SifatWITH A SOUND CHAINbut with the addition: “in the form of a curly-haired, beardless young man wearing a green robe,” a condemned, disauthenticated addition and concatenation with another hadith that refers to Gibril. Hence al-Suyuti interpreted it either as a dream or, quoting his shaykh Ibn al-Humam, as “the veil of form” (hijab al-sura)… (Islamic Doctrines and Beliefs: Volume 1: The Prophets in Barzakh, The Hadith of Isra’ and Mir’aj, The Immense Merits of Al-Sham, The Vision of Allah, Al-Sayyid Muhammad Ibn ‘Alawi al-Maliki, translation and notes by Dr. Gibril Fouad Haddad [As-Sunna Foundation of America 1999], pp. 137-138; bold and capital emphasis mine)In a footnote the translator mentions another narration that says Allah appeared as a man:… and from Umm al-Tufayl by al-Tabarani (6:158 #3385). The latter chain actually states: “I saw my Lord in the best formof a beardless young man” and was rejected by al-Dhahabi inTahdhib al-Mawdua’at(p. 22 #22)… (p. 139, fn. 257; bold emphasis mine)The aforementioned narrations are either assuming that Allah took the form of a man, or that this is his actual uncreated shape or form.Commenting on the anthropomorphic beliefs of ibn Hanbal, Islamic scholar Dr. Wesley Williams noted that:Ibn Hanbal, then, was an anthropomorphist. He affirmed for the divine a human form, including a face, eyes, curly hair, mouth, voice breath, chest and two elbows, back, arms, hands with a palm, five fingers and fingertips, legs, shin, feet, soul, physical beauty, a limit, and even, shockingly, loins. He affirmed the external meaning of these attributes and refused to qualify them withbalkafa. (Williams, “Aspects of the Creed of Ahmad Ibn Hanbal: A study of Anthropomorphism in Early Islamic Discourse,” inInternational Journal of Middle Eastern Studies34 (2002), 441-463)Hence, ibn Hanbal like the so-called Salafi Muslims of today, was an anthropomorphist literalist who held that Allah literally has a body of some kind. This explains why Ibn Hanbal was adamant that Muslims must take the apparent words employed in the Quran and Muhammad’s ahadith, and are to refrain from interpreting them in an allegorical or figurative manner:One should not dispute with anyone, nor engage in formal debate, nor learn the art of argument. Verily,kalamregarding predestination, the sight (of God in the afterlife), the Qur’an, and other topics of the traditions is rejected and forbidden. Whoever does it, even if hiskalamshould agree with the Sunna, is not of the people of the Sunna until he rejects argument and surrenders. Ahmad b. Hanbal (‘Aqida III, in Ibn Abi Ya’la,Tabaqat al-Hanabila, 2:167, ed. Shaykh Ibn Uthaymin)God is over [‘ala] the Throne. The Footstool is at the place of His Two Feet… He moves, speaks, observes, looks, laughs [yadhaku], rejoices, and loves… He descends every night to the lowest heaven however He wills… The servants’ hearts are between two of the Most Merciful’s fingers… He will put His foot in the Fire, causing it to recoil. Ahmad b. Hanbal (‘Aqida I, Ibn Abi Ya’la,Tabaqat, 1:61-62)According to us,Hadithis taken according to its apparent meaning (zahirihi) just as what came from the Prophet. Talking [kalam] about it is an innovation. But we believe in it as it came to its apparent meaning (‘ala zahirihi). Hanbal (‘Aqida III, Ibn Abi Ya’la,Tabaqat, 2:168)As another Muslim authority explained:Thezahirof the wording is what comes first to the mind from that text, irrespective of whether it is literal [haqiqa] or figurative. (Ibn Qudama,Dhamma al-taw’il, 55)So, there you have it folks!Muhammad’s god is a beautiful beardless young pubescent boy with short curly hair who wears a red dress!",

At first he put her in the care of his aunt Salma, in whose house Rifa‘ah had already taken refuge. Rayhanah herself was averse to entering Islam, but Rifa‘ah, and his kinsmen of the Bani Hadl spoke to her about the new religion and it was not long before one of the three young converts, Tha‘labah by name, came to the Prophet and told him that Rayhanah had entered Islam, whereupon he greatly rejoiced. When it became clear that she was not pregnant,he went to her and offered to set her free and to make her his wife. But she said: “O Messenger if God, leave me in thy power; that will be easier for me and for thee.” (Martin Lings,Muhammad: His Life Based on the Earliest Sources[Inner Traditions International, Ltd., One Park Street, Rochester, Vermont 05767; 1983], p. 233; emphasis mine)Even the Muslim writings are not able to hide the fact of Muhammad being a vile, immoral, sexual deviant.",

Muhammad was also guilty of doing to others what he did not anyone to do to either himself or his followers.For example, when a man came to Muhammad to ask him permission to fornicate, or have sex with women, the latter asked him a series of questions in order to highlight just how perverted and selfish his request truly was:“… Imam Ahmad recorded Abu Umamah saying that a young man came to the Prophet and said, ‘O Messenger of Allah! Give me permission to commitZina(unlawful sex).’ The people surrounded him and rebuked him, saying, ‘Stop! Stop!’ But the Prophet said…<<Come close.>>The young man came to him, and he said…<<Sit down.>>so he sat down. The Prophet said…<<Would you like it (unlawful sex) for your mother?>>He said, ‘No, by Allah, may I be ransomed for you.’ The Prophet said…<<Neither do the people like it for their mothers.>>The Prophet said…<<Would you like it for your daughter?>>He said, ‘No, by Allah, may I be ransomed for you.’ The Prophet said…<<Neither do the people like it for their daughters.>>The Prophet said…<<Would you like it for your sister?>>He said, ‘No, by Allah, may I be ransomed for you.’ The Prophet said…<<Neither do the people like it for their sisters.>>The Prophet said…<<Would you like it for your paternal aunt?>>He said, ‘No, by Allah, O Allah's Messenger! may I be ransomed for you.’ The Prophet said…<<Neither do the people like it for their paternal aunts.>>The Prophet said…<<Would you like it for your maternal aunt?>>He said, ‘No, by Allah, O Allah's Messenger! may I be ransomed for you.’ The Prophet said…<<Neither do the people like it for their maternal aunts.>>Then the Prophet put his hand on him and said…<<O Allah, forgive his sin, purify his heart and guard his chastity.>>After that the young man never paid attention to anything of that nature.” (Tafsir,Q. 17:32)What makes this advice rather troubling is that Muhammad did not practice it himself, nor did his followers, since he permitted them to take women captive and have sex with them, even married ones whose husbands were still alive!Also (prohibited are) women already married,except those whom your right hands possess: Thus hath God ordained (Prohibitions) against you: Except for these, all others are lawful, provided ye seek (them in marriage) with gifts from your property, - desiring chastity, not lust, seeing that ye derive benefit from them, give them their dowers (at least) as prescribed; but if, after a dower is prescribed, agree Mutually (to vary it), there is no blame on you, and God is All-knowing, All-wise. S. 4:24 Y. AliAs shocking as it may sound, this passage is basically stating that the only time a Muslim man (which includes Muhammad) can sleep with a married woman is when she happens to be one of the female slaves that he has taken captive!Unfortunately, this verse was tragically and shamefully put into practice by the jihadists:Abu Sirma said to Abu Sa'id al Khadri: O Abu Sa'id, did you hear Allah's Messenger mentioning al-'azl? He said: Yes, and added: We went out with Allah's Messenger on the expedition to the Bi'l-Mustaliqand took captive some excellent Arab women; and we desired them, for we were suffering from the absence of our wives, (but at the same time) we also desired ransom for them.So we decided to have sexual intercourse with them but by observing 'azl (Withdrawing the male sexual organ before emission of semen to avoid conception).But we said: We are doing an act whereas Allah's Messenger is amongst us; why not ask him? So we asked Allah's Messenger, and he said: It does not matter if you do not do it, for every soul that is to be born up to the Day of Resurrection will be born. (Sahih Muslim, Book 008,Number 3371)Abu Said al-Khudri said: The apostle of Allah sent a military expedition to Awtas on the occasion of the battle of Hunain. They met their enemy and fought with them. They defeated them and took them captives. Some of the Companions of the Apostle of Allahwere reluctant to have intercourse with the female captives in the presence of their husbands who were unbelievers.So Allah, the Exalted, sent down the Quranic verse, ‘And all married women (are forbidden) unto you save those (captives) whom your right hands possess’. That is to say, they are lawful for them when they complete their waiting period. (Sunan Abu Dawud, Volume 2, Number 2150)How unfortunate that Muhammad and his deity did not share the shame and concern of their followers regarding the morality of raping captives whose husbands were still alive, but actually rushed in to compose a text to justify such a wicked and perverted act!This same narration is found in all of the major hadith collections:Chapter 36. What Has Been Related (About A Man) Who Captures A Slave Woman That Has A Husband, Is It Lawful For Him To Have Relations With Her?1132.Abu Sa‘eed Al-Khudri narrated: We got some captives on the day of Awtas, and they had husbands among their people. They mentioned that to the Messenger of Allah,so the following was revealed: And women who are already married, except those whom your right hands possess.(Hasan)(English Translation of Jami‘ At-Tirmidhi, Compiled by Imam Hafiz Abu ‘Eisa Mohammad Ibn ‘Eisa At-Tirmidhi, From Hadith No. 544 to 1204, translated by Abu Khaliyl (USA), ahadith edited and referenced by Hafiz Tahir Zubair ‘Ali Za’i [Darussalam Publishers & Distributors, First Edition: November 2007], Volume 2, p. 502; underline emphasis ours)(3) 3016.Abu Sa‘eed Al-Khudri said: “On the Day of Awtas, we captured some women who had husbands among the idolaters.SO SOME OF THE MEN DISLIKED THAT, so Allah, Most High, revealed: ‘And women already married, except those whom your right hands possess….’”(Sahih)[Abu ‘Eisa said:] This Hadith is Hasan.(4) 3017.Abu Sa‘eed Al-Khudri said: “we captured some women on the Day of Awtas and they had husbands among their people. That was mentioned to the Messenger of Allahso Allah revealed: ‘…And women already married, except those whom your right hands possess….”(Sahih)[Abu ‘Eisa said:] This Hadith is Hasan.This is how it was reported by Ath-Thawri, from ‘Uthman Al-Batti, from Abu Al-Khalil, from Abu Sa‘eed Al-Khudri from the Prophet and it is similar. “From Abu ‘Alqamah” is not in this Hadith and I do not know of anyone who mentioned Abu ‘Alqamah in this Hadith except in what Hammam mentioned from Qatadah. Abu Al-Khalil’s name is Salih bin Abi Mariam. (Jami‘ At-Tirmidhi, Volume 5, From Hadith No. 2606 to 3290, Chapter 4. Regarding SuratAn-Nisa’, pp. 331-332; capital and underline emphasis ours)To make matters worse, Muhammad granted his men permission to marry women for a short period of time for the sole purpose of gratifying their sexual cravings:Narrated Jabir bin ‘Abdullah and Salama bin Al-Akwa': While we were in an army, Allah's Apostle came to us and said, \"You have been allowed to do the Mut’a (marriage), so do it.\" Salama bin Al-Akwa' said: Allah's Apostle's said, \"If a man and a woman agree (to marry temporarily), their marriage should last for three nights, and if they like to continue, they can do so; and if they want to separate, they can do so.\"I do not know whether that was only for us or for all the people in general. Abu Abdullah (Al-Bukhari) said: ‘Ali made it clear that the Prophet said, \"The Mut’a marriage has been cancelled (made unlawful).\" (Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 7, Book 62,Number 52)Narrated Abdullah:We used to participate in the holy battles led by Allah's Apostle and we had nothing (no wives) with us. So we said, \"Shall we get ourselves castrated?\" He forbade us thatand then allowed us to marry women with a temporary contract and recited to us: -- ‘O you who believe! Make not unlawful the good things which Allah has made lawful for you, but commit no transgression.’ (5.87) (Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 7, Book 62,Number 13o)This practice continued to be observed until the time of Umar’s caliphate:Ibn Uraij reported: 'Ati' reported that Jabir b. Abdullah came to perform 'Umra, and we came to his abode, and the people asked him about different things, and then they made a mention of temporary marriage, whereupon he said:Yes, we had been benefiting ourselves by this temporary marriage during the lifetime of the Holy Prophet and during the time of Abu Bakr and ‘Umar. (Sahih Muslim, Book 008,Number 3248)Tragically, there were some instances in which women got pregnant through such unions:Yahya related to me from Malik from Ibn Shihab from Urwa ibn az-Zubayr that Khawla ibn Hakim came to Umar ibn al-Khattab and said, \"Rabia ibn Umayya made a temporary marriage with a woman and she is pregnant by him.\" Umar ibn al-Khattab went out in dismay dragging his cloak, saying, \"This temporary marriage, had I come across it, I would have ordered stoning and done away with it!\" (Malik’s Muwatta, Book 28,Number 28.18.42)Today such a practice would be called prostitution, plain and simple.With the foregoing in view, it is obvious that Muhammad and his followers did to other people’s mothers, wives, daughters, nieces, aunts etc., the very thing that he did not want to be done to the mothers, wives, daughters, nieces, aunts etc. of Muslims.In light of this, we would like to ask the followers of Muhammad the very same questions that their prophet asked the young man.Would the Muslims like it if someone contracted temporary marriage with their mothers? What about with their daughters, sisters, paternal or maternal aunts? How about their grandmothers, granddaughters, female cousins, nieces etc.?Moreover, would the Muslims be okay with a group of invaders coming to their lands and taking their women captive in order to have sex with them? And would they be perfectly all right with such men taking their wives and having sex with them before selling them off to someone else (or even keeping them as their own personal property)?If the Muslims would have a problem with all of this then why do they follow a man who permitted his hordes to basically rape captive women, including married ones whose husbands were still alive? And why would they want to believe in a man who virtually allowed women to be treated like prostitutes by permitting his followers to contract temporary marriages whose only objective was to satisfy the carnal, lustful desires of men who didn’t have the will power to control their sexual urges?The fact is that Muhammad stands condemned by his own teachings and Muslims should therefore abandon such a man and turn to the risen Lord Jesus who is their only hope of salvation and eternal bliss.",

    "full_content": "ALLAH NEVER SAID TO ADAM “I AM GOD, WORSHIP ME”A Debate Challenge to Islamic ApologeticsBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionFor centuries, Islamic polemicists have sought to undermine the divinity of Jesus Christ by demanding Christians produce an explicit verse from the Bible in which Jesus declares in verbatim:“I am God, worship me.”This rhetorical strategy attempts to place the Christian faith under a burden of proof that is not applied consistently to Islam itself. While this approach may appear persuasive at a superficial level, it collapses under the weight of its own logic when mirrored back onto the Qur’an and its theology of Allah’s self-revelation.The central challenge, therefore, is this:If Muslims insist that Jesus must utter in verbatim “I am God, worship me” for His divinity to be valid, then where does Allah ever tell Adam—the first man and prophet in Islam—“I am God, worship me”?The Qur’anic SilenceAccording to Islamic tradition, Adam is not only the first human but also the first prophet. If Allah truly is the God of Adam, the foundational prophet of Islam, then one would reasonably expect the Qur’an to contain a direct, unequivocal declaration where Allah introduces Himself in clear divine self-identification to Adam. Yet upon examining the Qur’an, there existsno single ayah where Allah says to Adam explicitly: “I am God, worship me.”Instead, the Qur’an provides vague references to Allah creating Adam (Qur’an 2:30–34; 7:11–18), breathing into him (Qur’an 15:29), and commanding angels to bow before Adam. But strikingly absent is the explicit divine command of self-revelation to Adam in the form of“I am God, worship me.”This silence raises an academic problem: if Muslims demand verbatim divine self-identification from Jesus as proof of divinity, consistency demands they also produce verbatim divine self-identification from Allah to Adam. Their inability to do so, using their own standard, disqualifies Allah as Adam’s God.The Double Standard of Islamic PolemicsThe Muslim objection to Christ’s divinity often functions on afalse standard of linguistic exactness.By demanding that Christians locate exact wording absent from Scripture, they ignore the overwhelming theological witness of the New Testament in which Jesus claims divine prerogatives:He forgives sins (Mark 2:5–7), a prerogative belonging to God alone.He identifies Himself with Yahweh’s “I AM” (John 8:58).He accepts worship (Matthew 14:33; John 9:38).He declares unity with the Father (John 10:30).The Qur’an, however, offers no parallel clarity for Allah’s self-revelation to Adam. If Jesus’ divinity is denied because the Bible does not contain the precise sentence Muslims demand, then Allah’s claim to deity over Adam must likewise be denied, since the Qur’an never records such a statement.Theological ConsequencesFor Islam:By its own argumentative logic, Islam cannot affirm that Allah is Adam’s God, since Allah never utters to Adam, “I am God, worship me.”For Christianity:The Christian faith rests not on contrived verbatim formulas but on the totality of Christ’s words, deeds, and identity as God Incarnate. The New Testament provides abundant testimony that Jesus is God, without the need for artificial proof-texting.For Debate Consistency:Muslim apologists must abandon their double standard. Either they admit that divine identity can be communicated without a rigid verbatim formula (thus validating Christ’s divinity), or they must accept that Allah fails to qualify as Adam’s God.ConclusionThe polemic that demands Christians show Jesus saying verbatim “I am God, worship me” ultimately backfires on Islam. The Qur’an contains no record of Allah saying to Adam, “I am God, worship me.” By the very standard Muslims apply to deny Christ’s divinity, Allah is disqualified from being the God of Adam.Therefore, the debate challenge stands:If Muslims reject Jesus’ divinity for lack of verbatim phrasing, then where in the Qur’an does Allah introduce Himself to Adam in the same explicit manner?Until such an ayah is produced—which does not exist—Muslim polemics remain inconsistent and self-defeating.ReferencesThe Holy Bible, English Standard Version (ESV).The Qur’an (translations by Pickthall, Yusuf Ali, and Sahih International).Ali, A.

However, when one compares the Qur’an with the Hebrew Bible and Christian Scriptures, a pattern of dissonance emerges. One stark contradiction lies betweenHosea 11:1—where God declares Israel to be His child—andSurah 5:18, where Muhammad, speaking in the name of Allah, rebukes Jews and Christians for claiming to be God’s children. This raises a profound theological question: If Allah is the same God as Yahweh, why would He contradict His own revealed Word? This inconsistency calls into question the reliability of Muhammad’s message, the identity of Allah, and the Qur’an’s claim to divine authorship.God as Father in the Hebrew BibleThe Hebrew Bible presents Yahweh’s covenantal relationship with Israel in parental terms. Hosea 11:1 states:“When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son.”The metaphor of fatherhood conveys divine intimacy, covenantal care, and enduring love. Other Old Testament passages echo this truth:“Is not he your father, who created you, who made you and established you?”(Deuteronomy 32:6).“You are the children of the LORD your God”(Deuteronomy 14:1).“Have we not all one Father? Has not one God created us?”(Malachi 2:10).The fatherhood of God is not merely symbolic but covenantal—establishing Israel’s identity as God’s people. Yahweh Himself uses the language of family, calling Israel “My son, my firstborn” (Exodus 4:22).Muhammad’s Rebuke of God’s FatherhoodThe Qur’an, however, directly repudiates this concept. Surah 5:18 records:“But the Jews and the Christians say, ‘We are the children of Allah and His beloved.’ Say: ‘Why then does He punish you for your sins? Rather, you are humans from among those He created.’”This rebuke dismisses divine fatherhood as illegitimate, reducing God’s relationship with humanity to one of master and servant. Furthermore, the Qur’an categorically denies that God has children in any sense:“It is not befitting for Allah to take a son.”(Surah 19:35).“They say: ‘The Most Merciful has taken a son.’ Exalted is He! Rather, they are honored servants.”(Surah 21:26).By rejecting divine fatherhood, Muhammad’s Allah presents a radically different theology from the God of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Jesus Christ.Theological Implications: Is Allah the God of the Bible?If Allah were truly Yahweh, He would not contradict His own revelation. God’s Word is eternal and unchanging:“The grass withers, the flower fades, but the word of our God will stand forever.”(Isaiah 40:8).“God is not man, that he should lie, or a son of man, that he should change his mind.”(Numbers 23:19).Thus, the contradiction between Hosea 11:1 and Surah 5:18 indicates that Allah is not Yahweh. Instead, Allah emerges as a false deity fabricated within Muhammad’s seventh-century Arabian context. Muhammad, therefore, cannot be regarded as a prophet of the biblical God, since his message fundamentally undermines the covenantal truths revealed in Scripture.Muhammad as a False ProphetThe Bible provides clear criteria for identifying false prophets:Contradiction with Previous Revelation–“If a prophet… says, ‘Let us go after other gods,’ … you shall not listen”(Deuteronomy 13:1–3).Muhammad directed followers toward a god whose nature contradicted Yahweh’s self-revelation.False Testimony of Christ–“Every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist”(1 John 4:3).The Qur’an denies Jesus’ Sonship (Surah 112:3) and crucifixion (Surah 4:157).Self-Glorification– Muhammad claimed to be the “seal of the prophets” (Surah 33:40), elevating himself above all others.These elements identify Muhammad not as a prophet of God, but as a deceiver who distorted biblical truths.The Falsehood of Islam’s Claim: “All Prophets Were Muslims”Islam asserts that Abraham, Moses, David, and Jesus were all Muslims who submitted to Allah. Yet, the scriptural evidence contradicts this:Abraham worshiped Yahweh, not Allah (Genesis 12:7–8).Moses addressed Yahweh as Israel’s Father (Deut. 32:6).David wrote of God as Father and King (Psalm 103:13).Jesus called GodAbba, Father(Mark 14:36), affirming divine fatherhood explicitly.To claim all prophets were Muslims is a historical and theological distortion, designed to appropriate Jewish and Christian heritage while erasing its substance.ConclusionThe contradiction between Hosea 11:1 and Surah 5:18 exposes the theological fault line between the God of Israel and Allah of the Qur’an. Yahweh revealed Himself as Father, yet Muhammad’s Allah denied divine fatherhood. This reveals that Muhammad was not a prophet of the God of Abraham, but a false prophet who misled his followers. Therefore, the Qur’an cannot be trusted as divine revelation, and Islam’s claim that all prophets were Muslims collapses under the weight of biblical truth.The world must recognize that Muhammad’s message stands in opposition to God’s eternal Word, and that salvation is found not in submission to Allah, but in relationship with the Father through His Son, Jesus Christ (John 1:12; John 14:6).ReferencesThe Holy Bible, English Standard Version (ESV).Al-Qur’an, Surah Al-Ma’idah 5:18; Surah Maryam 19:35; Surah Al-Anbiya 21:26; Surah An-Nisa 4:157; Surah Al-Ahzab 33:40; Surah Al-Ikhlas 112:3.Kaiser, Walter C.Toward an Old Testament Theology.

Muslims are taught that Allah is utterly unlike His creation:“There is nothing like unto Him”(Qur’an 42:11). Yet, paradoxically, several Qur’anic verses and Hadith traditions attribute to Allah physical attributes and organs, such as hands (Qur’an 38:75), a face (Qur’an 55:27), eyes (Qur’an 11:37), and even a shin (Qur’an 68:42). This raises a profound theological question: if Allah possesses what is described as a “shin,” how can He simultaneously claim to be wholly unlike human beings, who also possess shins?This article critically examines this contradiction, placing the Qur’anic notion of Allah’s “shin” under scrutiny while contrasting it with classical Islamic theology, Jewish and Christian theological anthropology, and logical-philosophical inquiry.The Qur’anic Description of the “Shin”The critical verse is found inSurah al-Qalam(68:42):“[Remember] the Day when the shin will be uncovered, and they will be invited to prostration but they will not be able.”Classical commentators (e.g., al-Tabari, Ibn Kathir, al-Qurtubi) debated whether the “shin” (sāq) in this passage refers literally to an organ of Allah or metaphorically to a sign of severe distress. Some schools of thought, particularly the Athari and early Hanbali traditions, insisted on affirming the attributebi-lā kayf(“without asking how”), meaning that Allah does indeed have a shin but it is unlike the human shin. Ashʿarī and Māturīdī theologians, however, leaned toward metaphorical interpretations, claiming it was an Arabic idiom for hardship.Yet, regardless of interpretation, the text introduces anthropomorphic imagery, which cannot easily be reconciled with the absolute claim of divine incomparability.The Problem of AnthropomorphismThe central contradiction lies in the following tension:Allah declares absolute dissimilarity from creation(Qur’an 42:11).Allah is described with human organs(hands, eyes, face, shin).Human beings also possess these very organs.If Allah’s shin is literal, then He shares a common attribute with humanity, thereby undermining His transcendence. If it is metaphorical, then why employ anthropomorphic language at all, when such language inevitably leads to confusion, anthropomorphism, and internal contradiction?Christian theology faced similar tensions in Old Testament anthropomorphisms (e.g., “the hand of God”), but these were ultimately resolved in the doctrine of the Incarnation: God took on human form in Jesus Christ while remaining fully divine. Islam, however, denies incarnation while still attributing physical features to Allah. This results in a theological impasse: an anthropomorphic deity who is simultaneously claimed to be beyond all human likeness.Comparative Theological ReflectionJewish Tradition:Rabbinic interpretation often treated anthropomorphic references in the Torah as metaphorical or symbolic, pointing to God’s actions rather than His physical form.Christian Tradition:Anthropomorphisms find their fulfillment in Christ, who is the “image of the invisible God” (Colossians 1:15). Here, divine embodiment is not a contradiction but the core of the Incarnation.Islamic Tradition:Islamic theology vacillates between literalism (bi-lā kayf) and metaphorical reinterpretation (ta’wīl), leaving unresolved the inherent tension between transcendence and anthropomorphism.Philosophical AnalysisFrom a philosophical standpoint, the problem can be framed as follows:Premise 1:Allah claims absolute transcendence and dissimilarity.Premise 2:Allah is described with human-like organs such as a shin.Premise 3:Humans possess shins, hands, and faces.Conclusion:Either Allah is not utterly unlike humans, or the Qur’an introduces contradictory statements.The principle of non-contradiction (Aristotle,Metaphysics, IV.3) demands consistency. If Allah’s shin is literal, He shares features with creation. If figurative, then the Qur’an’s anthropomorphic language appears misleading or incoherent, especially when taken by literalist traditions.ConclusionThe description of Allah as possessing a “shin” epitomizes the anthropomorphic dilemma within Islamic theology. While theologians have attempted to resolve the issue either through metaphorical interpretation or the doctrine ofbi-lā kayf, the contradiction remains: if Allah is unlike humans, why attribute to Him organs that are distinctly human? Christianity resolves this tension through the Incarnation of Jesus Christ, while Islam remains trapped in a paradox between transcendence and anthropomorphism. This inconsistency undermines the Islamic claim of a perfectly coherent doctrine of God.References and BibliographyPrimary SourcesQur’an 42:11, 55:27, 68:42, 11:37, 38:75Sahih al-Bukhari, Sahih Muslim– collections affirming Allah’s physical attributes.Classical TafsirAl-Tabari,Jāmiʿ al-Bayān ʿan Taʾwīl Āy al-Qurʾān.Ibn Kathir,Tafsīr al-Qur’ān al-ʿAẓīm.Al-Qurtubi,Al-Jāmiʿ li-Aḥkām al-Qur’ān.Secondary LiteratureWolfson, H.

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteIntroductionOne of the most contentious issues in Christian-Muslim dialogue concerns the Qur’anic injunctions regarding relations between Muslims and non-Muslims, especially in the context of friendship, loyalty, and trust. Several Qur’anic passages explicitly warn Muslims not to take Christians, Jews, or other non-believers asawliya(friends, protectors, or allies). The exegetical and theological implications of these passages have historically shaped Islamic attitudes towards interfaith relations. This article critically examines these injunctions, their interpretations, and their moral implications, particularly in light of deception (taqiyya) and duplicity, which bear striking resemblance to what Scripture identifies as satanic qualities.Qur’anic Injunctions Against Friendship with Non-MuslimsThe Qur’an repeatedly instructs Muslims to avoid deep bonds of friendship and alliance with non-Muslims. For example:“O you who believe! Do not take the Jews and the Christians as awliya (friends or allies). They are allies of each other. And whoever among you takes them as allies is surely one of them. Indeed, Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.”(Qur’an 5:51).1“Let not the believers take disbelievers as allies instead of the believers. And whoever does that has nothing to do with Allah, unless you guard yourselves against them cautiously (except by way of precaution).”(Qur’an 3:28).2The Arabic termawliyacarries a range of meanings including “friends,” “protectors,” “patrons,” and “allies.” Classical exegetes such as Ibn Kathir emphasize that these verses are prohibitive, warning Muslims against political or emotional loyalty to Jews and Christians, while Al-Tabari underscores that taking them as protectors is tantamount to betraying Islamic faith itself.3The Principle of Deception (Taqiyya)The Qur’an (3:28) introduces a notable clause—“unless you guard yourselves against them cautiously”—which Muslim jurists have interpreted as legitimizing deception under certain circumstances. This doctrine, known astaqiyya, was historically systematized within Shi‘a Islam but also finds application among Sunnis in cases of necessity.4It allows Muslims to conceal their true beliefs or intentions when under threat, or in situations where outward friendship with non-Muslims might serve protective or strategic purposes.5Thus, the Islamic teaching can be summarized as follows:Muslims are forbidden to take non-Muslims as sincere friends.If forced by circumstance, they may outwardly pretend friendliness while inwardly harboring rejection or hostility.This duplicity is considered permissible as a safeguard for faith and community.Such a framework not only discourages genuine interfaith trust but also normalizes suspicion and hidden animosity in religious encounters.The Satanic Characteristics of DeceptionTheologically, this teaching raises profound moral concerns. Christianity identifies deception, lying, and hatred as the very attributes of Satan. Jesus describes Satan as“a liar and the father of lies”(John 8:44).6The Apostle Paul similarly warns that Satan disguises himself as an angel of light, using deception as his primary weapon (2 Corinthians 11:14).7When Muslims are taught to conceal their true intentions, feign friendship, and harbor inward hostility, these behaviors echo what Scripture characterizes as satanic attributes:Deception– Satan deceived Eve in the Garden (Genesis 3:4–5).8Duplicity– Satan masquerades as light while working evil (2 Corinthians 11:14).7Hatred– Satan fosters enmity and discord among humanity (Ephesians 6:12).9The Qur’anic teaching that authorizes deception towards non-Muslims therefore appears ethically and spiritually problematic, aligning with the properties of Satan rather than the God of truth and love revealed in Christ.The Christian ContrastIn contrast, the Christian Scriptures command believers to love all people, including enemies:“But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you”(Matthew 5:44).10The Apostle Paul exhorts Christians to live peaceably with all (Romans 12:18)11and to extend kindness and compassion universally (Ephesians 4:32).12Unlike the Qur’an, which permits hostility hidden beneath pretended friendship, the Bible calls for integrity, transparency, and sincerity in all relationships. True friendship and genuine love are not contingent upon religious identity but flow from the nature of God Himself, who“so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son”(John 3:16).13ConclusionThe Qur’anic prohibition against befriending non-Muslims, coupled with the sanctioning of deception (taqiyya), raises serious ethical and theological concerns. It fosters division, distrust, and enmity, while embodying traits Scripture attributes to Satan—deception, duplicity, and hatred. By contrast, the Gospel of Christ promotes universal love, honesty, and reconciliation. This divergence underscores the incompatibility between the Islamic doctrine of conditional, deceptive friendship and the Christian ethic of genuine love and truth.BibliographyNorman L.

    "full_content": "The Question of Salvation in Islam and ChristianityBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteOne of the most pressing theological issues between Islam and Christianity is the question of salvation and assurance of eternal life. The Qur’an itself acknowledges uncertainty in this matter, even concerning the Prophet Muhammad. InSurah al-Ahqaf(46:9), Muhammad declares:“I am not something original among the messengers, nor do I know what will be done with me or with you. I only follow that which is revealed to me, and I am only a clear warner.”This verse raises a critical point: Muhammad himself confessed ignorance of his ultimate destiny and that of his followers. From a doctrinal standpoint, this suggests that Islam does not guarantee salvation even to its founder, let alone to his adherents.Further, the Qur’an explicitly states inSurah Maryam(19:71):“There is none of you but will come to it [Hell]; this is upon your Lord an inevitability decreed.”Islamic commentators have long debated whether this means that all Muslims will inevitably enter Hell, if only temporarily, before possibly being delivered. Yet the plain text offers no assurance of escape, highlighting a stark contrast with the Christian promise of eternal life.In the New Testament, Jesus Christ declares with absolute authority:“I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me”(John 14:6).Unlike Muhammad’s uncertainty, Christ provides an unambiguous assurance of salvation through His sacrificial death and resurrection. The Apostle John affirms:“These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life”(1 John 5:13).Thus, the Christian Gospel offers not only the possibility but the certainty of eternal life for those who believe in Christ. Islam, by contrast, leaves its followers under the shadow of uncertainty and even warns of an inevitable encounter with Hell.ConclusionThe Qur’an’s admission of Muhammad’s ignorance about salvation (Qur’an 46:9) and its universal warning of Hell for all people (Qur’an 19:71) stand in profound tension with the Christian doctrine of assurance in Christ. While Islam offers no guarantee of paradise, the Gospel of Jesus Christ promises forgiveness, reconciliation with God, and eternal life to all who believe in Him. Therefore, there is no salvation outside of Jesus Christ.📚ReferencesThe Qur’an, Surah al-Ahqaf 46:9; Surah Maryam 19:71.The Holy Bible, John 14:6; 1 John 5:13.Ibn Kathir,Tafsir al-Qur’an al-‘Azim.Al-Tabari,Jami‘ al-Bayan fi Ta’wil al-Qur’an.",

This article examines that empirical fact, surveys Islamic and Christian/Jewish source material, considers historical and literary explanations, and raises critical questions directed to Muslim theological and historical accounts. The paper concludes by suggesting avenues for further research and offers footnote-style references and a journal-style bibliography.1. Introduction — statement of the problemReaders of the Qurʾān will note that most of the prophets named in its text are the same persons who appear in the Hebrew Bible. If one compiles the names that appear by explicit mention, a canonical count frequently cited in Islamic literature is 25 named prophets (though Islamic tradition also speaks of many thousands of prophets sent to humankind). The striking overlap between Qurʾānic prophet-names and the Hebrew Bible raises academic questions about source-relations, reception, and the Qurʾān’s self-presentation as a continuation or correction of earlier revelation. This paper sets out those facts, outlines possible explanatory frameworks, and formulates pointed, scholarly questions for Muslim interpreters.Riwaya+12. Empirical overview: who the Qurʾān names (selective list)The Qurʾān explicitly names (in its Arabic forms) many figures who are also prominent in Jewish and Christian scriptures: Adam, Noah (Nūḥ), Abraham (Ibrāhīm), Ishmael (Ismāʿīl), Isaac (Isḥāq), Jacob (Yaʿqūb), Joseph (Yūsuf), Moses (Mūsā), Aaron (Hārūn), David (Dāwūd), Solomon (Sulaimān), Job (Ayyūb), Jonah (Yūnus), Elijah (Ilyās), Elisha (Al-Yasaʿ), and Jesus (ʿĪsā), among others. Many Surahs explicitly list groups of prophets together (for example, Qurʾān 4:163 and 6:84 mention Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob and many of their descendants). The count “25 named prophets” is widely repeated in both Muslim devotional literature and academic summaries.Quran.com+2Quran.com+2Load-bearing facts (examples):The Qurʾān names a set of prophets that largely overlaps the Hebrew Bible’s principal figures (e.g., Moses, Abraham, David).Quran.com+1Islamic tradition (exegesis and hadith) also treats the “people of Israel” and their succession of prophets as a primary ancient prophetic locus.Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research+13. Historical and literary context (brief survey)Scholars of early Islam note several relevant points: the Qurʾān addresses communities in late antique Arabia who were already familiar with Jewish and Christian narratives; the Qurʾān self-presents as correcting or restoring what it calls distorted earlier scriptures; and the use of familiar biblical names and episodes functions rhetorically to situate Islam within an Abrahamic line and to make moral/theological points using well-known exemplars. Some recent academic discussions investigate how the Qurʾān engages Jewish and Christian textual materials and oral traditions in late antiquity.Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research+14. Onomastics (names and forms) — Arabic translations of older namesA straightforward observation is that the Qurʾān uses Arabicized forms of Semitic names (e.g., Ibrāhīm ← *Avraham/Abraham; Mūsā ←Moses; Isḥāq ←Isaac). Linguistically and historically this is unsurprising: Arabic and Hebrew/Aramaic are Semitic languages that share many roots and name forms; when a text moves between Semitic languages names are typically adapted phonologically. But the deeper question is not phonology alone — it is why the Qurʾān’s corpus uses a particular roster of named figures rather than naming more local Arabian, African, or Mesopotamian prophetic figures. This demands a historical explanation (see §5).Wikipedia5. Explanatory frameworks (competing hypotheses)Below are plausible scholarly frameworks that can help explain the predominance of Israelite/Jewish-named prophets in the Qurʾān. Each has different theological and historical consequences.A. Continuity hypothesis (Islamic theological claim).Islamic doctrine often asserts prophetic continuity: God sent prophets to every people (Qurʾān 35:24; 16:36) and the Qurʾān presumes many unnamed prophets, but it names those who are paradigmatic for its message. Thus, from an Islamic theological vantage, the Qurʾān’s list emphasizes the Abrahamic line because that lineage is central to the Qurʾān’s teaching. (Qurʾān 21:25; 33:40 discusses Muhammad as the seal of the prophets.)Quran.com+1B. Reception/availability hypothesis.Late antique Arabian audiences were exposed to Jewish and Christian narratives circulating in oral and written form. The Qurʾān selects names and episodes that would have immediate recognition and rhetorical force with such audiences; hence the high overlap. This is a literary-historical account that treats the Qurʾān as reworking existing narrative material.The Bart Ehrman Blog+1C. Canon-formation and selection bias.The Qurʾān is not an encyclopedic list of every prophet in world history; rather, it quotes and names a selection of exemplars suitable to its theological aims (e.g., monotheism, covenant, patience under persecution). Those exemplars happen to be the most prominent figures in the Judeo-Christian scriptural tradition. This is a functional explanation rather than a claim about origins.Quran.comD. Polemical/communicative hypothesis.Some scholars argue the Qurʾān intentionally engages Jewish and Christian scriptures polemically — to assert superiority/correction of what it calls corruptions — and therefore foregrounds the Israelite prophets as subjects of correction, exhortation, or confirmation.Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research+1Each framework yields different critical questions for Muslim theologians and historians. The next section lists such questions.6. Scholarly questions directed to Muslim interpreters (critical, respectful, and evidence-oriented)Selection logic:What theological or historical criteria determined which prophets would be named in the Qurʾān and which would remain unnamed? If prophecy was universal, why are predominantly Israelite figures the Qurʾān’s exemplars? (See Qurʾān 4:163; 6:84.)Quran.com+1Source relationships:To what extent does the Qurʾān depend on, adapt, or correct Jewish and Christian textual or oral traditions available in Arabia? Can Muslim scholarship map specific episodes to identifiable Jewish/Christian sources or oral cycles?The Bart Ehrman BlogOnomastic origins:Given that the Hebrew Bible predates the Qurʾān by many centuries, how should Muslim scholars explain the strictly Hebrew / Israelite provenance of so many prophet-names (beyond the shared Semitic linguistic milieu)? Is the Qurʾān presenting these figures as genuinely the same historical persons, or as analogues?WikipediaGeographical focus:Why does the Qurʾān’s named prophetic roster appear geographically concentrated in the Levant and Mesopotamia rather than, for example, in South Arabia, North Africa, or Persia — regions with their own religious histories? Are there Qurʾānic or hadithic sources that justify this geographical emphasis?Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research+1Tradition-critique:Some Hadith and exegetical traditions speak of many more prophets (e.g., 124,000). How do exegetes reconcile the wide number of prophets with the small set of named figures in the Qurʾān? What are the criteria used in early tafsīr for associating named Qurʾānic figures with biblical characters?Facebook+1Intertextual differences:Where the Qurʾān retells episodes known from the Hebrew Bible, how do the Qurʾānic versions differ in doctrinally significant ways (e.g., Christology, covenantal claims, eschatology)? Can those differences be shown to be innovations, corrections, or independent traditions?The Bart Ehrman Blog+1These questions invite substantive replies from Muslim exegetes and historians and can be the basis of constructive academic exchange.7. Methodology — how this inquiry was assembledThis paper compiled Qurʾānic references (selected verses that group or name prophets), primary hadith references about prophets (representative Sahih collections), comparative biblical citations (selected Genesis/Exodus passages for Abraham and Moses), and modern scholarship about Qurʾān–Biblical intertextuality. The purpose here is not to adjudicate ultimate theological truth claims but to map observable patterns and pose academically defensible questions.The Bart Ehrman Blog+3Quran.com+3AbdurRahman.Org+38. Discussion — implications and a modest conclusionThat most named prophets in the Qurʾān are figures known from Jewish (and Christian) scriptures is an empirically verifiable fact. Explanations range from theological claims of prophetic continuity to historical explanations about the textual environment of late antique Arabia. For critics, this overlap raises questions about source dependence, authorship, and the Qurʾān’s self-presentation as either a restoration of older revelation or as a text that draws upon familiar religious biographies to make new claims. For Muslim apologists, the overlap is typically explained by continuity (the same God sending the same core revelation to Abrahamic figures) and by functional selection (the Qurʾān names those exemplars most relevant to its message). Both sides should engage the historical and philological evidence carefully and respectfully.Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research+19. Suggested further research agendaA philological study comparing the Qurʾānic Arabic forms with Hebrew/Aramaic name variants, exploring transmission paths.A systematic mapping of Qurʾānic episodes to earliest extant Jewish and Christian texts and to known oral traditions.An examination of pre-Islamic Arabian inscriptions and narratives for non-Israelite prophetic traditions to test the geographical-selection hypothesis.A comprehensive review of tafsīr literature to catalogue exegetical rationales for the Qurʾān’s prophet selections.10.

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionIslamic theology affirms that every human being is born a Muslim, naturally disposed to recognize and submit to Allah. This claim is grounded in the Qur’anic doctrine offitrah(innate disposition), a belief that every child is born with an instinctive orientation toward monotheism. Yet this doctrine introduces serious theological and logical difficulties. If all humanity—including Adam—was already born in submission, what then is the need for religion, prophets, and revelation? The following study critically examines the coherence of Islam’sfitrahdoctrine and contrasts it with the biblical doctrine of creation, fall, and redemption.The Fitrah in the Qur’anThe Qur’an teaches that mankind is created in a state of natural submission:“So set your face toward the religion, inclining to truth. [Adhere to] the fitrah of Allah upon which He has created [all] people. No change should there be in the creation of Allah. That is the correct religion, but most of the people do not know”(Qur’an 30:30).¹Here, Islam asserts that submission to Allah is woven into human nature itself. Consequently, Adam is presumed to have been “born Muslim,” not by choice or revelation, but by creation. This implies that divine guidance is already embedded within man’s nature from birth.The Redundancy of Prophets in IslamIf mankind is already born in a state of submission, the question arises: why the need for prophets and scriptures at all? Prophets are traditionally viewed as guides who recall mankind to truth. But if thefitrahis uncorrupted and sufficient, such guidance becomes redundant. On the other hand, if guidance is still required, this implies that thefitrahis inadequate to preserve submission.This paradox undermines Islamic theology:If thefitrahis sufficient, then the Qur’an, prophets, and Muhammad are unnecessary.If thefitrahis insufficient, then the Qur’an contradicts itself by claiming all people are already born in submission.Infants, Judgment, and the Problem of SalvationThe Islamic position leads to further inconsistency. If all infants are born Muslim by default, then they already fulfill the divine requirement without knowledge of Muhammad or the Qur’an. Islamic tradition often holds that children who die before maturity enter Paradise based on theirfitrah.² But this undermines the necessity of Islam’s religious system, since revelation is not required for their salvation.If salvation is attainable without prophetic revelation for infants, why not for all humanity? This exposes a deep theological dilemma: either revelation is essential for salvation, in which case thefitrahdoctrine collapses, or revelation is non-essential, rendering Muhammad and the Qur’an unnecessary.The Biblical View: Creation, Fall, and RedemptionChristianity presents a more coherent account of humanity’s condition. The Bible teaches that Adam was indeed created in fellowship with God but fell into sin through disobedience (Genesis 3). This fall disrupted man’s natural communion with God, introducing death and alienation. Unlike the Islamic doctrine offitrah, the Bible affirms that mankind is not born in unbroken submission but in a fallen state:“Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me”(Psalm 51:5).³ The Apostle Paul echoes this:“Sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all people, because all sinned”(Romans 5:12).⁴Therefore, prophets in Scripture do not merely remind humanity of an innate submission but reveal God’s redemptive plan. This plan culminates in Jesus Christ, who restores mankind to fellowship with God through His death and resurrection (Romans 5:18–19; 1 Corinthians 15:22). Christianity thus explains both the need for revelation and the necessity of salvation in a way that is logically consistent and theologically complete.The Necessity of ChristWhere Islam struggles with the redundancy of prophets under thefitrahdoctrine, Christianity maintains coherence in affirming the necessity of Christ. Humanity is not simply misled but fallen. Thus, a mere reminder is insufficient; restoration requires atonement. Jesus fulfills this role uniquely—performing miracles (John 11:43–44), revealing God perfectly (John 14:9), dying for sin (Hebrews 9:26–28), and rising again (John 11:25). Unlike Muhammad, whose role is limited to instruction, Jesus provides actual redemption.Scholarly ImplicationsThe doctrine offitrahreveals a structural weakness in Islamic apologetics. By claiming that all people are born Muslim, Islam undercuts its own need for prophets and scripture. The Qur’an and Muhammad’s mission become either redundant or contradictory. Christianity, however, avoids this problem by offering a coherent anthropology: man was created good, fell into sin, and requires redemption through Christ. This framework accounts for both the necessity of revelation and the uniqueness of salvation history.From an academic standpoint, this paradox within Islam underscores the superiority of the biblical worldview. Islam attempts to explain the human condition through innate submission, but the reality of sin, moral corruption, and the universal need for redemption point toward the Christian gospel as the only consistent answer. Thus, while Islam’s doctrine offitrahfalters under scrutiny, the Christian narrative demonstrates theological integrity, historical grounding, and salvific necessity.ReferencesQur’an 30:30 (Sahih International translation).Sahih al-Bukhari 1385; Sahih Muslim 2658 — traditions affirming that children of Muslims (and, in some narrations, all children) are admitted into Paradise.Psalm 51:5 (NIV).Romans 5:12 (NIV).

IntroductionThe rise of Islam in the 7th century introduced a new prophetic claim: Muhammad as the “seal of the prophets” and bearer of the final revelation. However, the Qur’an and Hadith preserve accounts that Muhammad not only encountered but also convertedjinns(spiritual beings in Islamic cosmology). This claim presents a theological dilemma when evaluated against the biblical record. In Scripture, God’s prophets never engaged in dialogue with unclean spirits—rather, they consistently cast them out and demonstrated God’s authority over them.The Qur’an’s portrayal of Muhammad as a prophet to both humans and jinn, therefore, raises fundamental questions: Is this consistent with the God of the Bible? Or does it reveal that Muhammad’s experiences originated from a different spiritual source?This paper will critically examine Muhammad’s interaction with jinns, contrast it with biblical revelation, and argue that such encounters undermine the claim of Muhammad’s legitimacy as a prophet of the one true God.2. Understanding the Concept of Jinn in IslamJinn in Pre-Islamic ArabiaBefore Islam, Arabs believed in jinn as invisible beings inhabiting deserts and ruins. They were associated with soothsayers, poets, and occult practices. Muhammad’s contemporaries were familiar with them as spirits capable of possession and mischief.Qur’anic Descriptions of JinnThe Qur’an repeatedly mentions jinns (over 30 times). They are described as created from smokeless fire (Surah 55:15), having free will, and divided into believers and unbelievers (Surah 72:11–15). This dual capacity aligns them closer to humans than to the biblical concept of demons, yet their functions—deception, haunting, and whispering evil (Surah 114:4–6)—parallel the role of demons in Scripture.Jinn in Hadith and TraditionHadith literature affirms Muhammad’s interaction with jinns. Reports narrate how jinns listened to the Qur’an, converted to Islam, and even asked Muhammad for religious instruction (Sahih al-Bukhari 731; Sahih Muslim 450). The famousLaylatul Jinndescribes Muhammad spending an entire night with them.These sources elevate Muhammad not only as prophet of mankind but also of the jinn—earning him the titleMab’uth ila al-Thaqalayn(“Sent to the two heavy creatures: humans and jinn”).3. Biblical Theology of Demons and Unclean SpiritsOld Testament Condemnation of SpiritismThe Torah strictly forbids interaction with spirits:“Do not turn to mediums or necromancers; do not seek them out” (Leviticus 19:31).“There shall not be found among you… one who inquires of the dead, for whoever does these things is an abomination to the Lord” (Deuteronomy 18:10–12).Jesus Christ and Authority Over DemonsJesus’ ministry demonstrated complete authority over demons. He did not negotiate with them but commanded them to leave (Mark 1:25; Luke 8:29). The demons recognized Him as the Son of God but remained under condemnation.Apostolic Ministry and DeliveranceThe apostles followed Christ’s example by casting out spirits in His name (Acts 16:18; Acts 19:11–12). Nowhere do they invite demons into God’s covenant.Key point:In biblical theology, demons are irredeemable, destined for eternal fire (Matthew 25:41). Salvation is for humanity, not for fallen spirits.4. Muhammad’s Interaction with Jinns: Qur’anic AccountsSurah al-Jinn 72:1–2: Jinn hear Qur’an and declare faith.Surah al-Jinn 72:13–14: Some jinn declare themselves Muslims, others deviators.Surah al-Ahqaf 46:29–32: Jinn listen attentively, return to warn their own kind.Tradition further expands:Muhammad taught jinns Islam duringLaylatul Jinn.Companions reportedly saw signs of their encampment.Problem:This places Muhammad in fellowship with spirits rather than exercising authority over them, directly contradicting the biblical pattern.5. Theological Contradictions with the BibleMuhammad’s interaction with jinns creates sharp theological dissonance when compared with biblical revelation.Dialogue vs. ExorcismThe Qur’an describes Muhammad listening to jinns, allowing them to speak, and even affirming their declarations of faith (Surah al-Jinn 72:1–2). Conversely, biblical prophets—especially Jesus Christ—never entertained dialogue with unclean spirits. When demons spoke in the Gospels, Christ silenced them immediately (Mark 1:25; Luke 4:35). The biblical model reveals that allowing spirits to speak is a violation of divine authority. Dialogue is always replaced by exorcism.Question:Why did Muhammad allow spirits to speak freely instead of silencing or casting them out as Christ did?Fellowship vs. Separation from SpiritsThe Qur’an presents jinns as capable of entering fellowship with believers, joining the covenant community, and even evangelizing other jinns (Surah al-Ahqaf 46:29–32). This is in stark contradiction with the biblical command:“Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers… what fellowship has light with darkness? What accord has Christ with Belial?” (2 Corinthians 6:14–15).If Muhammad integrated jinns into his community, then the God behind his message is permitting what the God of the Bible forbids.Question:Why does Islam embrace fellowship with spirits, while Yahweh commands separation?Salvation for Jinn vs. Eternal Judgment of DemonsThe Qur’an depicts some jinns as “Muslims” and recipients of guidance (Surah al-Jinn 72:13–14). Yet, the Bible is clear: demons are eternally condemned. Jesus declares that the lake of fire was prepared “for the devil and his angels” (Matthew 25:41). Revelation 20:10 confirms their final destruction.If Muhammad preached salvation for spirits that God has eternally condemned, then Islam introduces a theological impossibility: redemption for fallen beings beyond redemption.Question:Did Muhammad contradict God’s eternal decree by offering salvation to jinns?6. Questioning the Source of Muhammad’s RevelationThe divergence between Muhammad’s dealings with jinns and biblical theology raises the question:What was the true source of Muhammad’s revelation?Possible Demonic DeceptionPaul warns the Corinthian church:“Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light” (2 Corinthians 11:14).If Satan can disguise himself as an angel, how much more could he disguise himself as “jinns” affirming a false message? Rather than evidence of divine truth, Muhammad’s encounters could be viewed as demonic deception designed to establish a false religion.Question:If Satan deceives through appearances of light, could the so-called “jinns” Muhammad converted have been demons masquerading as believers?The Problem of Contradictory RevelationThe Qur’an claims continuity with the Torah and Gospel (Surah 5:46; Surah 3:3). Yet, it denies the crucifixion (Surah 4:157), rejects the Sonship of Christ (Surah 19:35), and allows fellowship with spirits. These contradictions reveal that the Qur’an cannot come from the same God who authored the earlier Scriptures.Question:How can Allah claim to confirm the Torah and Gospel while simultaneously contradicting their central doctrines?Muhammad’s Early Experiences of “Possession”Historical sources—including Islamic traditions—acknowledge that Muhammad initially feared he was demon-possessed. Sahih al-Bukhari records that he contemplated suicide after his first revelations because he thought he had been afflicted by ajinnor demon (Bukhari 6982). His experiences included convulsions, trembling, and auditory hallucinations—phenomena consistent with spirit possession.Question:If Muhammad himself feared demonic possession at the beginning, should later encounters with jinn be interpreted as divine or as confirmation of his earliest fears?7. Does Allah Equal the God of the Bible?One of the most pressing theological questions raised by Muhammad’s interaction with jinns is the identity ofAllah. Muslims insist that Allah is the same God worshiped by Abraham, Moses, and Jesus. However, the Qur’an’s teachings about Allah diverge so radically from the Bible’s testimony of Yahweh that such a claim cannot withstand scrutiny.7.1 The Incompatibility of Allah’s Nature with YahwehThe God of the Bible reveals Himself as holy, transcendent, and utterly separate from all forms of darkness. He repeatedly warns His people to avoid mediums, necromancers, and interaction with spirits (Deuteronomy 18:10–12; Isaiah 8:19–20). Yahweh cannot contradict His own holiness by later permitting fellowship with spirits (jinns).Allah, however, not only permits such fellowship but also affirms that some jinns can be Muslims and part of his covenant community (Surah al-Jinn 72:11–14). This accommodation of spirits marks a fundamental difference in divine nature: Yahweh rejects, Allah embraces.Critical Question:If Allah embraces jinns while Yahweh condemns all dealings with spirits, how can they be the same God?7.2 Qur’an’s Rejection of Crucifixion and SonshipThe greatest divergence between Allah and Yahweh is found in Christology. The Bible testifies that Jesus is the eternal Son of God, crucified for the sins of the world and raised to life (John 3:16; Romans 10:9; 1 Corinthians 15:3–4). The crucifixion and resurrection are the core of the gospel message.Yet the Qur’an explicitly denies both:Denial of Crucifixion:“They did not kill him, nor crucify him, but it was made to appear so to them” (Surah 4:157).Denial of Sonship:“It is not befitting for Allah to take a son” (Surah 19:35).A god who denies the central act of salvation cannot be equated with the God who provided that salvation.Critical Question:If Allah denies the crucifixion and resurrection, is he not rejecting the very foundation of biblical redemption?7.3 The Qur’an’s Claim to Confirm Previous Scriptures ExaminedThe Qur’an repeatedly claims to affirm the Torah and the Gospel:“He sent down the Torah and the Gospel aforetime as guidance for mankind” (Surah 3:3).“We sent, following in their footsteps, Jesus, son of Mary, confirming the Torah that came before him. We gave him the Gospel, in which was guidance and light” (Surah 5:46).Yet, when measured against these very Scriptures, the Qur’an stands in contradiction. The Torah condemns communication with spirits. The Gospels declare Jesus as the Son of God and affirm His death and resurrection. The Qur’an both permits spirit fellowship and denies the gospel.This inconsistency reveals that the Qur’an’s claim to continuity is false. Rather than confirming, it corrupts.Critical Question:If the Qur’an contradicts the Torah and Gospel on their most essential truths, how can Allah claim to be their author?8. Scholarly Questions on Muhammad’s ProphethoodThe interaction of Muhammad with jinns is not an isolated curiosity; it forces us to reevaluate the authenticity of his entire prophetic claim. When examined through the lens of biblical revelation, the Qur’an, and historical tradition, numerous scholarly questions arise that demand careful consideration.8.1 Why Did Muhammad Interact with Jinns Instead of Casting Them Out?In the Bible, unclean spirits are never considered candidates for redemption but are consistently cast out under God’s authority.Jesus silenced demons and expelled them (Mark 1:25; Luke 8:29).Muhammad, however, invited jinns into dialogue, converted them, and even spent a night teaching them (Laylatul Jinn).Question:If Muhammad were a prophet of the holy God, why did he normalize communion with spirits instead of demonstrating divine authority by casting them out?8.2 Why Does Islam Offer Salvation to Jinns When the Bible Declares Their Doom?The Qur’an teaches that jinns can be Muslims or unbelievers (Surah al-Jinn 72:11–14).The Bible states that demons are bound for eternal judgment (Matthew 25:41; Revelation 20:10).Salvation is a human privilege through Christ’s sacrifice, not an option for fallen angels or demons.Question:Did Muhammad expand the scope of salvation beyond God’s revealed plan, thus contradicting the gospel?8.3 Why Does the Qur’an Contradict the Torah and Gospel?The Qur’an claims to affirm earlier revelations (Surah 5:46).Yet it denies Christ’s crucifixion and sonship, core doctrines of the Gospel.It also undermines the Torah’s prohibitions on spiritism by legitimizing interaction with jinns.Question:How can Muhammad be a prophet of the same God if his message fundamentally contradicts the very Scriptures he claims to confirm?8.4 Why Was Muhammad Initially Convinced He Was Possessed?Early Islamic tradition (Sahih al-Bukhari 6982) records Muhammad’s fear that he was demon-possessed.His experiences of trembling, foaming, and convulsions resemble demonic oppression.Later claims of angelic or jinn encounters only deepened his reliance on spiritual visitations.Question:If Muhammad’s first instinct was that he was demon-possessed, should that testimony not be taken seriously as evidence of the true source of his experiences?8.5 Why Does Muhammad Lack the Prophetic Pattern of the Bible?Prophets of Yahweh consistently called Israel back to covenant faithfulness, affirming God’s holiness and truth.They performed signs in God’s name, vindicating their authority (Exodus 4:30; 1 Kings 18:36–39).Jesus Christ, as the culmination of prophecy, performed undeniable miracles and conquered death.Muhammad performed no verifiable miracles apart from Qur’anic recitation and his reported encounters with spirits.Question:Why does Muhammad’s ministry align more with occult mediums and spiritists than with biblical prophets?8.6 Why Does Muhammad’s Teaching Introduce a Different God?The God of the Bible revealed Himself as Yahweh, covenant-keeper, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.The Qur’an introduces Allah, who denies Sonship, crucifixion, resurrection, and holy separation from spirits.This Allah cannot be equated with Yahweh.Question:If Muhammad’s god rejects the central truths of the Bible, is it not clear that Allah is a different god entirely?8.7 Why Should Muhammad Be Trusted Over the Apostles and Jesus?Jesus and His apostles consistently testified to His death and resurrection (Luke 24:46–48; 1 Corinthians 15:3–8).Their testimony was sealed with martyrdom.Six centuries later, Muhammad contradicted their witness with no corroborating evidence.Question:Why should Muhammad’s solitary claims about Christ and the unseen world override the unanimous testimony of those who walked with Jesus?Section 9: The Beast’s Mark and the Deception of IslamThe Book of Revelation warns that the Beast will causeall people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a markon their right hand or forehead, without which no one can buy or sell (Revelation 13:16–17). This mark is not only economic but spiritual—it represents allegiance to the Beast system in opposition to Christ.When we turn to the Quran and Hadith, we see disturbing parallels. The Quran speaks of a mark upon the wicked:Quran 55:41:“The guilty will be recognized by their marks, and they will be seized by their forelocks and their feet.”This resembles Revelation’s description of visible identification tied to guilt and allegiance.Furthermore, Islamic eschatology introducesthe Beast of the Earth (Dabbat al-Ard)who will emerge and literallymark people:Sunan Ibn Majah 4066: The Beast will appear and “brand the people on their noses.”Jami` at-Tirmidhi 3187: The Beast will stamp believers and unbelievers, distinguishing them for judgment.This stamping or branding is nothing less than aprecursor to the Mark of the Beast.While Revelation presents the Beast’s mark as a satanic counterfeit of God’s seal on His people (Revelation 7:3), Islamic prophecy glorifies the very act of being branded, claiming it as a divine decree. In reality, it inverts the truth: what Revelation condemns as satanic bondage, Islam promotes as divine identification.Another alarming parallel lies in Islamic economic restrictions. Sharia law mandates compliance with Islamic practices—such as prayer, fasting, zakat (almsgiving), and confession of the shahada. Those who refuse to submit are marginalized, fined, or executed in Islamic history. This mirrors Revelation’s warning:no one can buy or sell except the one who bears the mark.Islam already sets up a system where survival is tied to religious allegiance, foreshadowing the Beast’s final system of control.Thus, what the Bible identifies as a mark of eternal damnation, Islam presents as a sign of obedience to Allah. Thiscomplete inversion of good and evilis the very essence of satanic deception. The Beast of Revelation and the Beast of Islam are not separate figures—they are one and the same.Section 10: Islam’s Role in the One World Religion of the AntichristThe Apostle John foresaw a coming global religion in which all nations would worship the Beast:“And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb”(Revelation 13:8). This false worship system, energized by Satan, will unite political, economic, and religious power under one banner. The question is: how does Islam fit into this apocalyptic framework?1. Islam’s Universal ClaimUnlike other religions that remain regional, Islam presents itself as aglobal faith for all people, declaring:“We have not sent you (O Muhammad) except to all mankind”(Quran 34:28). This universal claim mirrors Revelation’s prediction of a religion demanding worldwide allegiance. Islam is not content with coexistence—it seeks domination. Through its missionary zeal (dawah) and militant enforcement (jihad), Islam positions itself as the perfect candidate to merge with or even lead the Beast’s final system.2. Denial of Christ as the Son of GodThedefining doctrine of the Antichristis the denial of the Father and the Son (1 John 2:22). Islam institutionalizes this denial in its very creed. The shahada—“There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is his messenger”—excludes Jesus as Son of God and denies His divine identity. Furthermore, Surah 4:157–158 outright denies the crucifixion, the very foundation of Christian salvation. Thus, Islam already preaches the spirit of Antichrist.3. Preparation for the One-World Submission SystemThe Arabic word“Islam” means submission.Revelation warns that the Beast will require submission through the Mark. Historically, Islam spread by demanding conquered peoples choose between conversion, taxation (jizya), or death. This anticipates the coercive nature of the Antichrist’s system, where worship and loyalty are not optional but mandatory. The Islamic framework of Sharia already demonstrates how religious law can govern every aspect of political, social, and economic life—exactly what Revelation describes under the Beast.4. The False Unity of “Abrahamic Faiths”In our time, we see attempts to merge Islam, Christianity, and Judaism under the banner of “Abrahamic Faiths.” Projects such as theAbrahamic Family Housein Abu Dhabi symbolize the push toward interfaith unification. Yet, this unity is not rooted in Christ but in compromise and denial of His divinity. Islam plays a central role in this movement because it demands recognition of Muhammad and the Quran while rejecting the Gospel. Such efforts foreshadow the false religious system of Revelation 17, where the harlot (false religion) rides the Beast before being consumed by it.5. The Islamic Messiah: al-Mahdi and the AntichristIslamic eschatology anticipates the coming ofal-Mahdi, a global leader who will establish justice, unite nations, and enforce Islamic law. Strikingly, his description parallels the Antichrist of Scripture. The Mahdi will demand allegiance, destroy Christian symbols, and rule from Jerusalem—precisely where Revelation says the Antichrist will set up his throne (2 Thessalonians 2:4). The Islamic Jesus (Isa), who denies His crucifixion and assists the Mahdi, functions as the False Prophet. Together, they replicate the Antichrist-Beast-False Prophet triad of Revelation.Conclusion of Section 10Islam is not merely a religion among many—it is uniquely positioned to play a central role in the Beast’s final world system. By denying Christ, demanding submission, and anticipating a counterfeit messiah, Islam provides both the theological and political framework for theOne World Religion of the Antichrist.Section 11: The Quran as the Counterfeit RevelationThe Book of Revelation is thefinal prophetic disclosureof Jesus Christ, the Alpha and Omega, who unveils the consummation of history and the victory of God over evil. It contains warnings, promises, and a vision of eternal hope. In stark contrast, the Quran presents itself as a “final revelation,” yet it functions as acounterfeit to Revelation, borrowing fragments of biblical truth only to twist them into a narrative that denies Christ’s divinity and glorifies a false messenger.1. Revelation from Christ vs. Revelation from “Allah”Revelation (Bible):Given by Jesus Christ to John through an angel (Revelation 1:1). It exalts Christ as the Lamb slain, the eternal Son of God, and King of kings.Quran (Islam):Claimed to be given by Allah to Muhammad through an angel (Jibril). It denies Christ’s Sonship, rejects His cross, and elevates Muhammad as the “seal of prophets.”This structural similarity is not accidental—it is a satanic imitation. Where Christ’s Revelation ends with eternal worship of the Lamb (Revelation 22:3–5), the Quran ends with eternal servitude to Allah, a false god who cannot save.2. The Lamb vs. the BeastIn Revelation, the central figure is the Lamb of God, slain yet victorious. Worship of the Lamb leads to eternal life. In the Quran, however, the central theme is allegiance to Allah and his messenger. Instead of a Lamb who gives His life for the world, the Quran elevates a messenger who spreads his message by the sword. This contrast reflects the true vs. counterfeit savior: theLamb vs. the Beast.3. The Seal of God vs. The Mark of the BeastRevelation describes a sealing of God’s people on their foreheads (Revelation 7:3). This seal is spiritual, marking believers for divine protection and eternal life. The Quran, however, introduces a physical branding by the Beast (27:82, supported by Hadith), presenting it as a sign from Allah. What Revelation condemns as the Mark of the Beast, Islam calls a divine sign—turning salvation into damnation.4. The Warning Against Altered RevelationThe Bible ends with a stern warning:“If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book”(Revelation 22:18). The Quran, however, arrives600 years laterclaiming to correct, replace, and abrogate the Gospel. By presenting itself as a new scripture, it directly violates Revelation’s warning and places itself under judgment. The Quran is not a continuation—it is a corruption.5. A Tale of Two EternitiesRevelation’s climax:The New Jerusalem, the dwelling of God with redeemed humanity, where there is no more death, sorrow, or pain.Quran’s climax:A paradise of sensual pleasures (virgins, wine, rivers of milk and honey), appealing to earthly lusts rather than heavenly holiness.The sharp difference reveals the counterfeit nature of the Quranic “paradise.” It offers fleshly indulgence, not eternal communion with God.Conclusion of Section 11The Quran stands as thecounterfeit Revelation—a demonic inversion of the true vision given by Christ to John. Where the Bible ends with eternal worship of the Lamb, the Quran ends with eternal denial of Him. Where Revelation promises holiness, the Quran promises indulgence. Where Revelation warns against adding new prophecy, Islam adds a false book. The Quran, therefore, is not the word of God but the twisted counterfeit of the final book of Scripture.Section 12: Muhammad as the False Prophet of RevelationThe Book of Revelation does not only warn of theBeast (Antichrist)but also of theFalse Prophet, who works alongside the Beast to deceive the nations. This False Prophet performs deceptive “signs,” compels worship of the Beast, and promotes allegiance to the Beast’s system (Revelation 13:11–15). When we examine Muhammad’s life and mission, we find disturbing parallels that align him precisely with the role of the False Prophet described in Scripture.1. The False Prophet Promotes the BeastIn Revelation, the False Prophet directs humanity’s worship toward the Beast, enforcing allegiance.In Islam, Muhammad directs all devotion toward Allah—an entity who denies Christ as the Son of God (Quran 4:171, 5:72). By proclaiming a deity who is not the Father of Jesus, Muhammad promoted aBeast-like counterfeit god.2. The False Prophet Speaks “Like a Dragon”Revelation 13:11 describes the False Prophet as having two horns like a lamb but speaking like a dragon. This means he appears gentle and religious outwardly, but his words originate from satanic deception.Muhammad presented himself as a prophet in the line of Abraham, Moses, and Jesus, appearing as a continuation of biblical tradition (“two horns like a lamb”).Yet his message directly contradicts the heart of the Gospel: denying the crucifixion (Quran 4:157), the Sonship of Christ (Quran 112:3), and salvation through grace. Thisvoice of denialis the voice of the dragon.3. The False Prophet Performs Signs of DeceptionRevelation warns that the False Prophet will deceive the world with lying wonders (Revelation 13:14). Muhammad’s so-called “miracles” fit this description:Hisnight journey to heaven (Isra and Mi’raj)lacks historical or rational foundation, yet it is celebrated as proof of divine favor.His encounters withjinn—beings the Bible associates with demons—are presented as moments of revelation and conversion, when in reality they are marks of demonic alliance.The Quran itself is presented as the “greatest miracle,” but its contradictions, borrowings, and denials of biblical truth expose it as a work of deception.4. The False Prophet Enforces Worship and PersecutionRevelation describes the False Prophet enforcing worship of the Beast under penalty of death (Revelation 13:15). Islam historically follows this pattern:Apostasy laws in Sharia demand death for those who leave Islam.Non-Muslims are forced into submission under dhimma contracts, paying jizya or facing death.Entire nations were conquered under the cry of“Allahu Akbar”—not as free worship, but as enforced allegiance to Muhammad’s god.5. The Final Judgment of the False ProphetRevelation 19:20 states:“The beast was captured, and with it the false prophet who in its presence had done the signs by which he deceived those… These two were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur.”This prophetic destiny aligns with Muhammad, who spread deception, denied Christ, and led millions into error. Unless Islam’s followers repent and turn to the true Jesus Christ, both the system of the Beast and the prophet who promoted it face eternal judgment.Conclusion of Section 12When evaluated against the criteria of Revelation, Muhammad emerges not as a prophet of God, but as the very embodiment of theFalse Prophet. He denied the core of the Gospel, promoted allegiance to a counterfeit god, performed lying signs, allied with demons, and enforced submission through violence. In light of Revelation, the case is overwhelming: Muhammad fulfills the role of the False Prophet who serves the Beast, deceiving the nations until the final judgment.Section 13: The Inversion of Christ’s Gospel in IslamThe Apostle Paul warned in Galatians 1:8–9 that even if an angel from heaven preached a different gospel, it must be rejected as accursed. Islam, through Muhammad, presents itself as a continuation and correction of the biblical faith. Yet, when examined carefully, it becomes clear that Islam does not supplement the Gospel of Christ butinverts it—reversing every foundational truth into its opposite. This inversion is not merely doctrinal disagreement; it is asystematic satanic counterfeit.1. The Cross of Christ vs. Denial of the CrossThe Gospel:The crucifixion of Jesus is the central event of salvation. On the cross, Christ bore the sins of the world, reconciling humanity to God (1 Peter 2:24).Islam:The Quran explicitly denies that Jesus was crucified (Quran 4:157–158), claiming instead that it only appeared so. By removing the cross, Islam removes the atonement, leaving mankind without redemption.2. The Sonship of Christ vs. Denial of SonshipThe Gospel:Jesus is the eternal Son of God, begotten of the Father, one with Him in divinity (John 3:16; John 10:30).Islam:The Quran repeatedly denies God having a Son (Quran 112:3, 19:35, 25:2), declaring such belief as blasphemy. This strikes at the very heart of Christianity, for if Christ is not the Son, He cannot be the Savior.3. Grace vs. Works-Based SubmissionThe Gospel:Salvation is by grace through faith, not of works, so that no man may boast (Ephesians 2:8–9).Islam:Entrance to paradise depends on adherence to Islamic law, rituals, and good deeds, with no assurance of salvation except martyrdom. This shifts the focus from God’s finished work in Christ to man’s endless striving under Sharia.4. Resurrection Life vs. Earthly LustsThe Gospel:Eternal life is communion with God, where there is no death, sorrow, or sin. The redeemed are clothed in righteousness and dwell forever in God’s holy presence (Revelation 21:3–4).Islam:Paradise is depicted as sensual indulgence—gardens, rivers of wine, and virgins for sexual gratification (Quran 56:22–24, 78:31–34). Rather than lifting the soul into holiness, Islam’s “heaven” caters to fleshly appetites, inverting the true promise of spiritual renewal.5. Christ the Eternal Word vs. Muhammad the “Final Prophet”The Gospel:Christ is the Alpha and Omega, the final Word of God (John 1:1; Revelation 22:13). No revelation can follow Him because He is God’s full and perfect disclosure.Islam:Muhammad is called the “Seal of the Prophets” (Quran 33:40), superseding Jesus. The Quran claims to replace and correct the Gospel. This is the very fulfillment of Paul’s warning about another gospel delivered by an “angel” (Galatians 1:8).6. Freedom in Christ vs. Bondage in IslamThe Gospel:Christ liberates believers from the law of sin and death, offering freedom in the Spirit (Romans 8:2).Islam:Muslims live under fear—fear of Allah’s wrath, fear of failing rituals, fear of apostasy punishable by death. It is a religion of bondage, not freedom.Conclusion of Section 13Islam is not simply a different perspective on biblical truth; it is amirror image in reverse—a deliberate inversion of the Gospel. It denies the cross, rejects the Son, replaces grace with works, trades resurrection glory for sensual lust, substitutes Muhammad for Christ, and enslaves where Christ frees. This inversion aligns perfectly with satanic strategy: to twist God’s truth into its opposite and lead nations into darkness. Thus, Islam must not be seen as an Abrahamic sibling faith but as theantithesis of the Gospel of Christ.Section 14: The Prophetic Warning Against Islam in ScriptureThe Bible not only proclaims the truth of the Gospel but also forewarns believers about coming deceptions that would oppose Christ. These warnings find clear fulfillment in the rise of Islam, a system that denies Jesus as the Son of God, rejects the cross, and exalts a false prophet. When examined through the lens of prophecy, Islam emerges as one of the greatest fulfillments of biblical warnings against antichrist systems.1. The Spirit of Antichrist (1 John 2:22–23)John writes:“Who is the liar? It is whoever denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a person is the antichrist—denying the Father and the Son. No one who denies the Son has the Father; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also.”Islam explicitly denies Jesus as the Son of God (Quran 4:171, 19:35).By this definition, Islam is not a neutral faith but carries thespirit of antichrist.2. A Different Gospel (Galatians 1:8–9)Paul warns:“If we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let them be under God’s curse.”Islam claims to be revealed by the angel Jibril (Gabriel).Its message contradicts the Gospel by denying the crucifixion and salvation by grace.Thus, Islam falls under Paul’s curse against “another gospel.”3. The Lawless One (2 Thessalonians 2:3–4, 9–10)Paul speaks of theman of lawlessnesswho exalts himself over all that is called God and sets himself up in God’s temple. His coming will be in accordance with Satan’s work, with false signs and wonders.Muhammad exalted himself as the “seal of the prophets” and final messenger, placing his words above Christ’s.His so-called miracles, such as splitting the moon and conversing with jinn, arelying wonders.His law (Sharia) binds millions in oppression, making him a precursor to the lawless system of the Beast.4. The Beast and the False Prophet (Revelation 13, 19:20)Revelation foresees a Beast and a False Prophet who deceive the nations, enforce worship, and receive a mark.The Beast mirrors Islam’s system of enforced submission (Islamitself means submission).The False Prophet aligns with Muhammad, who compelled allegiance to Allah, persecuted dissenters, and spread his message through conquest.The eschatologicalmarkresembles Islamic prophecy about the Beast stamping people, further tying Islam to Revelation’s warnings.5. Warnings About Doctrines of Demons (1 Timothy 4:1)Paul says:“The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons.”Islam originates in Muhammad’s encounters with “revelations” accompanied by convulsions, terror, and voices he feared were demonic.His repeated interactions with jinn (which the Bible identifies as unclean spirits) confirm that Islam’s foundation rests upondoctrines of demons.6. The Rise of a False Peace (Daniel 8:25)Daniel warns of a ruler who will “by peace destroy many.” Islam historically spread by conquest but cloaked itself in the rhetoric of peace (salaam). The promise of peace under Islam is deceptive, for true peace is only found in reconciliation with God through Christ.Conclusion of Section 14Scripture leaves no ambiguity. From John’s warnings about antichrist denial of the Son, to Paul’s condemnation of another gospel, to Revelation’s vision of the False Prophet, the prophetic word consistently points toward systems like Islam. Muhammad’s message fits hand-in-glove with the biblical profile of deception: it denies the Son, proclaims another gospel from an angel, exalts a false prophet, spreads doctrines of demons, and deceives nations under the guise of peace.The Bible did not overlook Islam; it anticipated it. Thus, Christians must recognize Islam not as a parallel path to God, but as aprophetically-foretold counterfeitthat fulfills the warnings of Scripture.Section 15: The Call to Christians in the Face of Islamic DeceptionThe biblical warnings about false prophets, counterfeit gospels, and antichrist systems are not given merely to satisfy theological curiosity. They are given so that the Church maystand firm, discern truth from error, and bear witness to the Gospel of Jesus Christ in a hostile world.In light of Islam’s inversion of the Gospel and fulfillment of prophetic warnings, Christians are called to a threefold response: vigilance, proclamation, and compassion.1. Vigilance in DiscernmentThe Apostle John commands:“Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits, whether they are of God; because many false prophets have gone out into the world”(1 John 4:1). Christians must recognize Islam for what it is—a religion founded upon denial of Christ’s divinity and the corruption of the Gospel. To treat it as a parallel path to God is to ignore the clear testimony of Scripture. Discernment requires courage to call Islam what the Bible calls it: antichrist.2. Boldness in ProclamationThe Apostle Paul declared:“I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes”(Romans 1:16). The only remedy for deception is the truth of Christ crucified and risen. Christians are therefore called to boldly proclaim Jesus as the eternal Son of God, the only Savior, and the final revelation of God. This proclamation must not be watered down to accommodate interfaith harmony but must confront the lie with the truth.3. Compassion for the DeceivedWhile Islam is a system of deception, Muslims themselves are not the enemy—they are captives in need of deliverance. Paul writes:“The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel”(2 Corinthians 4:4). The Church must therefore engage Muslims not with hatred but with the compassion of Christ, praying for their eyes to be opened and their hearts to be freed. Evangelism to Muslims must be coupled with love, patience, and unwavering conviction that only Jesus saves.4. Perseverance in Spiritual WarfarePaul reminds believers:“We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places”(Ephesians 6:12). The rise of Islam is not merely historical or cultural—it is spiritual. Christians must equip themselves with the armor of God, stand firm in prayer, and resist compromise with false religion.Conclusion of Section 15In the face of Islamic deception, Christians are not called to fear but to faithfulness. We must discern the truth of Scripture, proclaim the Gospel with boldness, show compassion to Muslims trapped in error, and persevere in spiritual warfare. Revelation ends with the victory of the Lamb and those who follow Him:“They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony”(Revelation 12:11).The call to the Church is clear: hold fast to Christ, reject counterfeit gospels, and bear witness to the only Savior who is the Way, the Truth, and the Life (John 14:6). In doing so, we expose the lie of Islam and magnify the eternal glory of the Lamb who reigns forever.Conclusion and SummaryThis study has systematically examined Islam through the lens of biblical prophecy, apocalyptic literature, and theological discernment, revealing Islam not as a continuation of divine revelation but as a counterfeit system aligned with end-time deception. Across fifteen sections, we have traced the interconnection between Islamic claims and the eschatological warnings given in the Holy Scriptures, concluding that Islam fulfills the prophetic profile of the Beast system, the false prophet, and the great deception foretold in Revelation and the Pauline epistles.Summary of Key ArgumentsIntroduction to Revelation 13 and Islamic ParallelsRevelation 13 warns of a Beast rising with deceptive power and authority, demanding allegiance through false miracles and blasphemous claims. When read in parallel with Islamic eschatology, particularly in the Qur’an and Hadith traditions, striking similarities emerge.The Beast, the False Witness, and the Mark of IslamIslam introduces concepts of a “Beast from the Earth” (Qur’an 27:82–83), a false witness against humanity (Qur’an 16:84–85), and a mark of allegiance (Qur’an 55:41), directly paralleling Revelation 13:11–18. These connections demonstrate that Islam’s eschatology mirrors, yet distorts, biblical prophecy.The False Prophet in Islamic TextsThe Qur’an and Hadith portray a future eschatological figure, particularly ‘Isa (Islamic Jesus), who denies the crucifixion and divinity of Christ. This “prophet” proclaims an anti-gospel, aligning closely with the False Prophet of Revelation who points the nations away from Christ.The Antichrist System and Islamic TheologyJohn describes Antichrist as one who denies the Father and the Son (1 John 2:22). Islam categorically denies Jesus’ Sonship and the Trinity, placing it firmly within the biblical definition of antichrist.The Mark of the Beast and Islamic SymbolsThe profession of the Shahada, enforced submission, and eschatological allegiance to the Mahdi and Islamic Jesus serve as equivalents to the “mark” in Revelation 13—symbols of ultimate loyalty to a counterfeit god.Islam’s Reversal of Biblical ProphecyIslamic eschatology consistently inverts biblical truths: Christ the returning King becomes subordinate to the Mahdi, the Antichrist becomes the Christian Messiah, and the cross is replaced by denial of crucifixion. This inversion demonstrates satanic mimicry.The Global Dominion of IslamRevelation describes a Beast exercising global dominion. Islam’s long-standing claim of universal submission under sharia, coupled with its expansionist eschatology, mirrors the apocalyptic vision of a religious-political empire seeking world domination.The Deceptive Power of Islamic RevelationMuhammad’s “revelations” bear the marks of deception—ecstatic seizures, contradictory teachings, and denial of Christ’s divinity. This corresponds with Paul’s warning in Galatians 1:8 of a “different gospel” delivered by an angelic messenger.The Role of the Dragon in Empowering IslamRevelation 13 emphasizes the Dragon (Satan) giving power to the Beast. Islam’s denial of Christ and violent enforcement of submission reveal the fingerprints of the Dragon, whose mission is to deceive the nations.The Quran as the Counterfeit ScriptureThe Qur’an positions itself as a “final revelation” while simultaneously undermining the Torah and Gospel. This fulfills the pattern of counterfeit scripture, imitating the form of divine revelation but stripping it of redemptive truth.Muhammad as the False Prophet of RevelationMuhammad fits the biblical profile of the False Prophet: he led people into idolatry of a false god (Allah), rejected Christ’s crucifixion, and validated his authority through coercion and false miracles.The Inversion of Christ’s Gospel in IslamWhere Christ proclaims salvation by grace through His death and resurrection, Islam offers salvation through works, law, and denial of the cross. This inversion is the hallmark of an antichrist gospel.Prophetic Warnings Against Islam in ScriptureThe Bible repeatedly warns of deceivers, false prophets, and systems that exalt themselves against the knowledge of Christ (2 Thessalonians 2; Matthew 24). Islam embodies these warnings, providing a living fulfillment of biblical prophecy.The Christian Response in the Face of Islamic DeceptionBelievers are called not to fear but to stand firm in truth, armed with discernment and the gospel of Jesus Christ. The call is to evangelize Muslims with love while rejecting the falsehood of Islam as a satanic counterfeit.Final ConclusionThe cumulative evidence demonstrates that Islam is not merely another world religion but a prophetically significant system of deception. It parallels the warnings of Revelation 13, mirrors the characteristics of the Beast and False Prophet, and actively denies the central truth of Christianity—the death, resurrection, and divinity of Jesus Christ. As such, Islam represents one of the clearest fulfillments of biblical prophecy concerning the end-time deception.Christians, therefore, must remain vigilant, discerning, and unwavering in the truth of the gospel. The Lamb who was slain is the true Redeemer, and no counterfeit system can prevail against His eternal kingdom. Revelation assures believers of Christ’s ultimate victory: the Beast, the False Prophet, and the Dragon will be cast into the lake of fire (Revelation 20:10). Our confidence rests not in fear of Islam but in the sovereignty of Christ, who has overcome the world.",

IntroductionThe rise of Islam in the 7th century introduced a new prophetic claim: Muhammad as the “seal of the prophets” and bearer of the final revelation. However, the Qur’an and Hadith preserve accounts that Muhammad not only encountered but also convertedjinns(spiritual beings in Islamic cosmology). This claim presents a theological dilemma when evaluated against the biblical record. In Scripture, God’s prophets never engaged in dialogue with unclean spirits—rather, they consistently cast them out and demonstrated God’s authority over them.The Qur’an’s portrayal of Muhammad as a prophet to both humans and jinn, therefore, raises fundamental questions: Is this consistent with the God of the Bible? Or does it reveal that Muhammad’s experiences originated from a different spiritual source?This paper will critically examine Muhammad’s interaction with jinns, contrast it with biblical revelation, and argue that such encounters undermine the claim of Muhammad’s legitimacy as a prophet of the one true God.2. Understanding the Concept of Jinn in IslamJinn in Pre-Islamic ArabiaBefore Islam, Arabs believed in jinn as invisible beings inhabiting deserts and ruins. They were associated with soothsayers, poets, and occult practices. Muhammad’s contemporaries were familiar with them as spirits capable of possession and mischief.Qur’anic Descriptions of JinnThe Qur’an repeatedly mentions jinns (over 30 times). They are described as created from smokeless fire (Surah 55:15), having free will, and divided into believers and unbelievers (Surah 72:11–15). This dual capacity aligns them closer to humans than to the biblical concept of demons, yet their functions—deception, haunting, and whispering evil (Surah 114:4–6)—parallel the role of demons in Scripture.Jinn in Hadith and TraditionHadith literature affirms Muhammad’s interaction with jinns. Reports narrate how jinns listened to the Qur’an, converted to Islam, and even asked Muhammad for religious instruction (Sahih al-Bukhari 731; Sahih Muslim 450). The famousLaylatul Jinndescribes Muhammad spending an entire night with them.These sources elevate Muhammad not only as prophet of mankind but also of the jinn—earning him the titleMab’uth ila al-Thaqalayn(“Sent to the two heavy creatures: humans and jinn”).3. Biblical Theology of Demons and Unclean SpiritsOld Testament Condemnation of SpiritismThe Torah strictly forbids interaction with spirits:“Do not turn to mediums or necromancers; do not seek them out” (Leviticus 19:31).“There shall not be found among you… one who inquires of the dead, for whoever does these things is an abomination to the Lord” (Deuteronomy 18:10–12).Jesus Christ and Authority Over DemonsJesus’ ministry demonstrated complete authority over demons. He did not negotiate with them but commanded them to leave (Mark 1:25; Luke 8:29). The demons recognized Him as the Son of God but remained under condemnation.Apostolic Ministry and DeliveranceThe apostles followed Christ’s example by casting out spirits in His name (Acts 16:18; Acts 19:11–12). Nowhere do they invite demons into God’s covenant.Key point:In biblical theology, demons are irredeemable, destined for eternal fire (Matthew 25:41). Salvation is for humanity, not for fallen spirits.4. Muhammad’s Interaction with Jinns: Qur’anic AccountsSurah al-Jinn 72:1–2: Jinn hear Qur’an and declare faith.Surah al-Jinn 72:13–14: Some jinn declare themselves Muslims, others deviators.Surah al-Ahqaf 46:29–32: Jinn listen attentively, return to warn their own kind.Tradition further expands:Muhammad taught jinns Islam duringLaylatul Jinn.Companions reportedly saw signs of their encampment.Problem:This places Muhammad in fellowship with spirits rather than exercising authority over them, directly contradicting the biblical pattern.5. Theological Contradictions with the BibleMuhammad’s interaction with jinns creates sharp theological dissonance when compared with biblical revelation.Dialogue vs. ExorcismThe Qur’an describes Muhammad listening to jinns, allowing them to speak, and even affirming their declarations of faith (Surah al-Jinn 72:1–2). Conversely, biblical prophets—especially Jesus Christ—never entertained dialogue with unclean spirits. When demons spoke in the Gospels, Christ silenced them immediately (Mark 1:25; Luke 4:35). The biblical model reveals that allowing spirits to speak is a violation of divine authority. Dialogue is always replaced by exorcism.Question:Why did Muhammad allow spirits to speak freely instead of silencing or casting them out as Christ did?Fellowship vs. Separation from SpiritsThe Qur’an presents jinns as capable of entering fellowship with believers, joining the covenant community, and even evangelizing other jinns (Surah al-Ahqaf 46:29–32). This is in stark contradiction with the biblical command:“Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers… what fellowship has light with darkness? What accord has Christ with Belial?” (2 Corinthians 6:14–15).If Muhammad integrated jinns into his community, then the God behind his message is permitting what the God of the Bible forbids.Question:Why does Islam embrace fellowship with spirits, while Yahweh commands separation?Salvation for Jinn vs. Eternal Judgment of DemonsThe Qur’an depicts some jinns as “Muslims” and recipients of guidance (Surah al-Jinn 72:13–14). Yet, the Bible is clear: demons are eternally condemned. Jesus declares that the lake of fire was prepared “for the devil and his angels” (Matthew 25:41). Revelation 20:10 confirms their final destruction.If Muhammad preached salvation for spirits that God has eternally condemned, then Islam introduces a theological impossibility: redemption for fallen beings beyond redemption.Question:Did Muhammad contradict God’s eternal decree by offering salvation to jinns?6. Questioning the Source of Muhammad’s RevelationThe divergence between Muhammad’s dealings with jinns and biblical theology raises the question:What was the true source of Muhammad’s revelation?Possible Demonic DeceptionPaul warns the Corinthian church:“Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light” (2 Corinthians 11:14).If Satan can disguise himself as an angel, how much more could he disguise himself as “jinns” affirming a false message? Rather than evidence of divine truth, Muhammad’s encounters could be viewed as demonic deception designed to establish a false religion.Question:If Satan deceives through appearances of light, could the so-called “jinns” Muhammad converted have been demons masquerading as believers?The Problem of Contradictory RevelationThe Qur’an claims continuity with the Torah and Gospel (Surah 5:46; Surah 3:3). Yet, it denies the crucifixion (Surah 4:157), rejects the Sonship of Christ (Surah 19:35), and allows fellowship with spirits. These contradictions reveal that the Qur’an cannot come from the same God who authored the earlier Scriptures.Question:How can Allah claim to confirm the Torah and Gospel while simultaneously contradicting their central doctrines?Muhammad’s Early Experiences of “Possession”Historical sources—including Islamic traditions—acknowledge that Muhammad initially feared he was demon-possessed. Sahih al-Bukhari records that he contemplated suicide after his first revelations because he thought he had been afflicted by ajinnor demon (Bukhari 6982). His experiences included convulsions, trembling, and auditory hallucinations—phenomena consistent with spirit possession.Question:If Muhammad himself feared demonic possession at the beginning, should later encounters with jinn be interpreted as divine or as confirmation of his earliest fears?7. Does Allah Equal the God of the Bible?One of the most pressing theological questions raised by Muhammad’s interaction with jinns is the identity ofAllah. Muslims insist that Allah is the same God worshiped by Abraham, Moses, and Jesus. However, the Qur’an’s teachings about Allah diverge so radically from the Bible’s testimony of Yahweh that such a claim cannot withstand scrutiny.7.1 The Incompatibility of Allah’s Nature with YahwehThe God of the Bible reveals Himself as holy, transcendent, and utterly separate from all forms of darkness. He repeatedly warns His people to avoid mediums, necromancers, and interaction with spirits (Deuteronomy 18:10–12; Isaiah 8:19–20). Yahweh cannot contradict His own holiness by later permitting fellowship with spirits (jinns).Allah, however, not only permits such fellowship but also affirms that some jinns can be Muslims and part of his covenant community (Surah al-Jinn 72:11–14). This accommodation of spirits marks a fundamental difference in divine nature: Yahweh rejects, Allah embraces.Critical Question:If Allah embraces jinns while Yahweh condemns all dealings with spirits, how can they be the same God?7.2 Qur’an’s Rejection of Crucifixion and SonshipThe greatest divergence between Allah and Yahweh is found in Christology. The Bible testifies that Jesus is the eternal Son of God, crucified for the sins of the world and raised to life (John 3:16; Romans 10:9; 1 Corinthians 15:3–4). The crucifixion and resurrection are the core of the gospel message.Yet the Qur’an explicitly denies both:Denial of Crucifixion:“They did not kill him, nor crucify him, but it was made to appear so to them” (Surah 4:157).Denial of Sonship:“It is not befitting for Allah to take a son” (Surah 19:35).A god who denies the central act of salvation cannot be equated with the God who provided that salvation.Critical Question:If Allah denies the crucifixion and resurrection, is he not rejecting the very foundation of biblical redemption?7.3 The Qur’an’s Claim to Confirm Previous Scriptures ExaminedThe Qur’an repeatedly claims to affirm the Torah and the Gospel:“He sent down the Torah and the Gospel aforetime as guidance for mankind” (Surah 3:3).“We sent, following in their footsteps, Jesus, son of Mary, confirming the Torah that came before him. We gave him the Gospel, in which was guidance and light” (Surah 5:46).Yet, when measured against these very Scriptures, the Qur’an stands in contradiction. The Torah condemns communication with spirits. The Gospels declare Jesus as the Son of God and affirm His death and resurrection. The Qur’an both permits spirit fellowship and denies the gospel.This inconsistency reveals that the Qur’an’s claim to continuity is false. Rather than confirming, it corrupts.Critical Question:If the Qur’an contradicts the Torah and Gospel on their most essential truths, how can Allah claim to be their author?8. Scholarly Questions on Muhammad’s ProphethoodThe interaction of Muhammad with jinns is not an isolated curiosity; it forces us to reevaluate the authenticity of his entire prophetic claim. When examined through the lens of biblical revelation, the Qur’an, and historical tradition, numerous scholarly questions arise that demand careful consideration.8.1 Why Did Muhammad Interact with Jinns Instead of Casting Them Out?In the Bible, unclean spirits are never considered candidates for redemption but are consistently cast out under God’s authority.Jesus silenced demons and expelled them (Mark 1:25; Luke 8:29).Muhammad, however, invited jinns into dialogue, converted them, and even spent a night teaching them (Laylatul Jinn).Question:If Muhammad were a prophet of the holy God, why did he normalize communion with spirits instead of demonstrating divine authority by casting them out?8.2 Why Does Islam Offer Salvation to Jinns When the Bible Declares Their Doom?The Qur’an teaches that jinns can be Muslims or unbelievers (Surah al-Jinn 72:11–14).The Bible states that demons are bound for eternal judgment (Matthew 25:41; Revelation 20:10).Salvation is a human privilege through Christ’s sacrifice, not an option for fallen angels or demons.Question:Did Muhammad expand the scope of salvation beyond God’s revealed plan, thus contradicting the gospel?8.3 Why Does the Qur’an Contradict the Torah and Gospel?The Qur’an claims to affirm earlier revelations (Surah 5:46).Yet it denies Christ’s crucifixion and sonship, core doctrines of the Gospel.It also undermines the Torah’s prohibitions on spiritism by legitimizing interaction with jinns.Question:How can Muhammad be a prophet of the same God if his message fundamentally contradicts the very Scriptures he claims to confirm?8.4 Why Was Muhammad Initially Convinced He Was Possessed?Early Islamic tradition (Sahih al-Bukhari 6982) records Muhammad’s fear that he was demon-possessed.His experiences of trembling, foaming, and convulsions resemble demonic oppression.Later claims of angelic or jinn encounters only deepened his reliance on spiritual visitations.Question:If Muhammad’s first instinct was that he was demon-possessed, should that testimony not be taken seriously as evidence of the true source of his experiences?8.5 Why Does Muhammad Lack the Prophetic Pattern of the Bible?Prophets of Yahweh consistently called Israel back to covenant faithfulness, affirming God’s holiness and truth.They performed signs in God’s name, vindicating their authority (Exodus 4:30; 1 Kings 18:36–39).Jesus Christ, as the culmination of prophecy, performed undeniable miracles and conquered death.Muhammad performed no verifiable miracles apart from Qur’anic recitation and his reported encounters with spirits.Question:Why does Muhammad’s ministry align more with occult mediums and spiritists than with biblical prophets?8.6 Why Does Muhammad’s Teaching Introduce a Different God?The God of the Bible revealed Himself as Yahweh, covenant-keeper, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.The Qur’an introduces Allah, who denies Sonship, crucifixion, resurrection, and holy separation from spirits.This Allah cannot be equated with Yahweh.Question:If Muhammad’s god rejects the central truths of the Bible, is it not clear that Allah is a different god entirely?8.7 Why Should Muhammad Be Trusted Over the Apostles and Jesus?Jesus and His apostles consistently testified to His death and resurrection (Luke 24:46–48; 1 Corinthians 15:3–8).Their testimony was sealed with martyrdom.Six centuries later, Muhammad contradicted their witness with no corroborating evidence.Question:Why should Muhammad’s solitary claims about Christ and the unseen world override the unanimous testimony of those who walked with Jesus?Section 9: The Beast’s Mark and the Deception of IslamThe Book of Revelation warns that the Beast will causeall people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a markon their right hand or forehead, without which no one can buy or sell (Revelation 13:16–17). This mark is not only economic but spiritual—it represents allegiance to the Beast system in opposition to Christ.When we turn to the Quran and Hadith, we see disturbing parallels. The Quran speaks of a mark upon the wicked:Quran 55:41:“The guilty will be recognized by their marks, and they will be seized by their forelocks and their feet.”This resembles Revelation’s description of visible identification tied to guilt and allegiance.Furthermore, Islamic eschatology introducesthe Beast of the Earth (Dabbat al-Ard)who will emerge and literallymark people:Sunan Ibn Majah 4066: The Beast will appear and “brand the people on their noses.”Jami` at-Tirmidhi 3187: The Beast will stamp believers and unbelievers, distinguishing them for judgment.This stamping or branding is nothing less than aprecursor to the Mark of the Beast.While Revelation presents the Beast’s mark as a satanic counterfeit of God’s seal on His people (Revelation 7:3), Islamic prophecy glorifies the very act of being branded, claiming it as a divine decree. In reality, it inverts the truth: what Revelation condemns as satanic bondage, Islam promotes as divine identification.Another alarming parallel lies in Islamic economic restrictions. Sharia law mandates compliance with Islamic practices—such as prayer, fasting, zakat (almsgiving), and confession of the shahada. Those who refuse to submit are marginalized, fined, or executed in Islamic history. This mirrors Revelation’s warning:no one can buy or sell except the one who bears the mark.Islam already sets up a system where survival is tied to religious allegiance, foreshadowing the Beast’s final system of control.Thus, what the Bible identifies as a mark of eternal damnation, Islam presents as a sign of obedience to Allah. Thiscomplete inversion of good and evilis the very essence of satanic deception. The Beast of Revelation and the Beast of Islam are not separate figures—they are one and the same.Section 10: Islam’s Role in the One World Religion of the AntichristThe Apostle John foresaw a coming global religion in which all nations would worship the Beast:“And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb”(Revelation 13:8). This false worship system, energized by Satan, will unite political, economic, and religious power under one banner. The question is: how does Islam fit into this apocalyptic framework?1. Islam’s Universal ClaimUnlike other religions that remain regional, Islam presents itself as aglobal faith for all people, declaring:“We have not sent you (O Muhammad) except to all mankind”(Quran 34:28). This universal claim mirrors Revelation’s prediction of a religion demanding worldwide allegiance. Islam is not content with coexistence—it seeks domination. Through its missionary zeal (dawah) and militant enforcement (jihad), Islam positions itself as the perfect candidate to merge with or even lead the Beast’s final system.2. Denial of Christ as the Son of GodThedefining doctrine of the Antichristis the denial of the Father and the Son (1 John 2:22). Islam institutionalizes this denial in its very creed. The shahada—“There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is his messenger”—excludes Jesus as Son of God and denies His divine identity. Furthermore, Surah 4:157–158 outright denies the crucifixion, the very foundation of Christian salvation. Thus, Islam already preaches the spirit of Antichrist.3. Preparation for the One-World Submission SystemThe Arabic word“Islam” means submission.Revelation warns that the Beast will require submission through the Mark. Historically, Islam spread by demanding conquered peoples choose between conversion, taxation (jizya), or death. This anticipates the coercive nature of the Antichrist’s system, where worship and loyalty are not optional but mandatory. The Islamic framework of Sharia already demonstrates how religious law can govern every aspect of political, social, and economic life—exactly what Revelation describes under the Beast.4. The False Unity of “Abrahamic Faiths”In our time, we see attempts to merge Islam, Christianity, and Judaism under the banner of “Abrahamic Faiths.” Projects such as theAbrahamic Family Housein Abu Dhabi symbolize the push toward interfaith unification. Yet, this unity is not rooted in Christ but in compromise and denial of His divinity. Islam plays a central role in this movement because it demands recognition of Muhammad and the Quran while rejecting the Gospel. Such efforts foreshadow the false religious system of Revelation 17, where the harlot (false religion) rides the Beast before being consumed by it.5. The Islamic Messiah: al-Mahdi and the AntichristIslamic eschatology anticipates the coming ofal-Mahdi, a global leader who will establish justice, unite nations, and enforce Islamic law. Strikingly, his description parallels the Antichrist of Scripture. The Mahdi will demand allegiance, destroy Christian symbols, and rule from Jerusalem—precisely where Revelation says the Antichrist will set up his throne (2 Thessalonians 2:4). The Islamic Jesus (Isa), who denies His crucifixion and assists the Mahdi, functions as the False Prophet. Together, they replicate the Antichrist-Beast-False Prophet triad of Revelation.Conclusion of Section 10Islam is not merely a religion among many—it is uniquely positioned to play a central role in the Beast’s final world system. By denying Christ, demanding submission, and anticipating a counterfeit messiah, Islam provides both the theological and political framework for theOne World Religion of the Antichrist.Section 11: The Quran as the Counterfeit RevelationThe Book of Revelation is thefinal prophetic disclosureof Jesus Christ, the Alpha and Omega, who unveils the consummation of history and the victory of God over evil. It contains warnings, promises, and a vision of eternal hope. In stark contrast, the Quran presents itself as a “final revelation,” yet it functions as acounterfeit to Revelation, borrowing fragments of biblical truth only to twist them into a narrative that denies Christ’s divinity and glorifies a false messenger.1. Revelation from Christ vs. Revelation from “Allah”Revelation (Bible):Given by Jesus Christ to John through an angel (Revelation 1:1). It exalts Christ as the Lamb slain, the eternal Son of God, and King of kings.Quran (Islam):Claimed to be given by Allah to Muhammad through an angel (Jibril). It denies Christ’s Sonship, rejects His cross, and elevates Muhammad as the “seal of prophets.”This structural similarity is not accidental—it is a satanic imitation. Where Christ’s Revelation ends with eternal worship of the Lamb (Revelation 22:3–5), the Quran ends with eternal servitude to Allah, a false god who cannot save.2. The Lamb vs. the BeastIn Revelation, the central figure is the Lamb of God, slain yet victorious. Worship of the Lamb leads to eternal life. In the Quran, however, the central theme is allegiance to Allah and his messenger. Instead of a Lamb who gives His life for the world, the Quran elevates a messenger who spreads his message by the sword. This contrast reflects the true vs. counterfeit savior: theLamb vs. the Beast.3. The Seal of God vs. The Mark of the BeastRevelation describes a sealing of God’s people on their foreheads (Revelation 7:3). This seal is spiritual, marking believers for divine protection and eternal life. The Quran, however, introduces a physical branding by the Beast (27:82, supported by Hadith), presenting it as a sign from Allah. What Revelation condemns as the Mark of the Beast, Islam calls a divine sign—turning salvation into damnation.4. The Warning Against Altered RevelationThe Bible ends with a stern warning:“If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book”(Revelation 22:18). The Quran, however, arrives600 years laterclaiming to correct, replace, and abrogate the Gospel. By presenting itself as a new scripture, it directly violates Revelation’s warning and places itself under judgment. The Quran is not a continuation—it is a corruption.5. A Tale of Two EternitiesRevelation’s climax:The New Jerusalem, the dwelling of God with redeemed humanity, where there is no more death, sorrow, or pain.Quran’s climax:A paradise of sensual pleasures (virgins, wine, rivers of milk and honey), appealing to earthly lusts rather than heavenly holiness.The sharp difference reveals the counterfeit nature of the Quranic “paradise.” It offers fleshly indulgence, not eternal communion with God.Conclusion of Section 11The Quran stands as thecounterfeit Revelation—a demonic inversion of the true vision given by Christ to John. Where the Bible ends with eternal worship of the Lamb, the Quran ends with eternal denial of Him. Where Revelation promises holiness, the Quran promises indulgence. Where Revelation warns against adding new prophecy, Islam adds a false book. The Quran, therefore, is not the word of God but the twisted counterfeit of the final book of Scripture.Section 12: Muhammad as the False Prophet of RevelationThe Book of Revelation does not only warn of theBeast (Antichrist)but also of theFalse Prophet, who works alongside the Beast to deceive the nations. This False Prophet performs deceptive “signs,” compels worship of the Beast, and promotes allegiance to the Beast’s system (Revelation 13:11–15). When we examine Muhammad’s life and mission, we find disturbing parallels that align him precisely with the role of the False Prophet described in Scripture.1. The False Prophet Promotes the BeastIn Revelation, the False Prophet directs humanity’s worship toward the Beast, enforcing allegiance.In Islam, Muhammad directs all devotion toward Allah—an entity who denies Christ as the Son of God (Quran 4:171, 5:72). By proclaiming a deity who is not the Father of Jesus, Muhammad promoted aBeast-like counterfeit god.2. The False Prophet Speaks “Like a Dragon”Revelation 13:11 describes the False Prophet as having two horns like a lamb but speaking like a dragon. This means he appears gentle and religious outwardly, but his words originate from satanic deception.Muhammad presented himself as a prophet in the line of Abraham, Moses, and Jesus, appearing as a continuation of biblical tradition (“two horns like a lamb”).Yet his message directly contradicts the heart of the Gospel: denying the crucifixion (Quran 4:157), the Sonship of Christ (Quran 112:3), and salvation through grace. Thisvoice of denialis the voice of the dragon.3. The False Prophet Performs Signs of DeceptionRevelation warns that the False Prophet will deceive the world with lying wonders (Revelation 13:14). Muhammad’s so-called “miracles” fit this description:Hisnight journey to heaven (Isra and Mi’raj)lacks historical or rational foundation, yet it is celebrated as proof of divine favor.His encounters withjinn—beings the Bible associates with demons—are presented as moments of revelation and conversion, when in reality they are marks of demonic alliance.The Quran itself is presented as the “greatest miracle,” but its contradictions, borrowings, and denials of biblical truth expose it as a work of deception.4. The False Prophet Enforces Worship and PersecutionRevelation describes the False Prophet enforcing worship of the Beast under penalty of death (Revelation 13:15). Islam historically follows this pattern:Apostasy laws in Sharia demand death for those who leave Islam.Non-Muslims are forced into submission under dhimma contracts, paying jizya or facing death.Entire nations were conquered under the cry of“Allahu Akbar”—not as free worship, but as enforced allegiance to Muhammad’s god.5. The Final Judgment of the False ProphetRevelation 19:20 states:“The beast was captured, and with it the false prophet who in its presence had done the signs by which he deceived those… These two were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur.”This prophetic destiny aligns with Muhammad, who spread deception, denied Christ, and led millions into error. Unless Islam’s followers repent and turn to the true Jesus Christ, both the system of the Beast and the prophet who promoted it face eternal judgment.Conclusion of Section 12When evaluated against the criteria of Revelation, Muhammad emerges not as a prophet of God, but as the very embodiment of theFalse Prophet. He denied the core of the Gospel, promoted allegiance to a counterfeit god, performed lying signs, allied with demons, and enforced submission through violence. In light of Revelation, the case is overwhelming: Muhammad fulfills the role of the False Prophet who serves the Beast, deceiving the nations until the final judgment.Section 13: The Inversion of Christ’s Gospel in IslamThe Apostle Paul warned in Galatians 1:8–9 that even if an angel from heaven preached a different gospel, it must be rejected as accursed. Islam, through Muhammad, presents itself as a continuation and correction of the biblical faith. Yet, when examined carefully, it becomes clear that Islam does not supplement the Gospel of Christ butinverts it—reversing every foundational truth into its opposite. This inversion is not merely doctrinal disagreement; it is asystematic satanic counterfeit.1. The Cross of Christ vs. Denial of the CrossThe Gospel:The crucifixion of Jesus is the central event of salvation. On the cross, Christ bore the sins of the world, reconciling humanity to God (1 Peter 2:24).Islam:The Quran explicitly denies that Jesus was crucified (Quran 4:157–158), claiming instead that it only appeared so. By removing the cross, Islam removes the atonement, leaving mankind without redemption.2. The Sonship of Christ vs. Denial of SonshipThe Gospel:Jesus is the eternal Son of God, begotten of the Father, one with Him in divinity (John 3:16; John 10:30).Islam:The Quran repeatedly denies God having a Son (Quran 112:3, 19:35, 25:2), declaring such belief as blasphemy. This strikes at the very heart of Christianity, for if Christ is not the Son, He cannot be the Savior.3. Grace vs. Works-Based SubmissionThe Gospel:Salvation is by grace through faith, not of works, so that no man may boast (Ephesians 2:8–9).Islam:Entrance to paradise depends on adherence to Islamic law, rituals, and good deeds, with no assurance of salvation except martyrdom. This shifts the focus from God’s finished work in Christ to man’s endless striving under Sharia.4. Resurrection Life vs. Earthly LustsThe Gospel:Eternal life is communion with God, where there is no death, sorrow, or sin. The redeemed are clothed in righteousness and dwell forever in God’s holy presence (Revelation 21:3–4).Islam:Paradise is depicted as sensual indulgence—gardens, rivers of wine, and virgins for sexual gratification (Quran 56:22–24, 78:31–34). Rather than lifting the soul into holiness, Islam’s “heaven” caters to fleshly appetites, inverting the true promise of spiritual renewal.5. Christ the Eternal Word vs. Muhammad the “Final Prophet”The Gospel:Christ is the Alpha and Omega, the final Word of God (John 1:1; Revelation 22:13). No revelation can follow Him because He is God’s full and perfect disclosure.Islam:Muhammad is called the “Seal of the Prophets” (Quran 33:40), superseding Jesus. The Quran claims to replace and correct the Gospel. This is the very fulfillment of Paul’s warning about another gospel delivered by an “angel” (Galatians 1:8).6. Freedom in Christ vs. Bondage in IslamThe Gospel:Christ liberates believers from the law of sin and death, offering freedom in the Spirit (Romans 8:2).Islam:Muslims live under fear—fear of Allah’s wrath, fear of failing rituals, fear of apostasy punishable by death. It is a religion of bondage, not freedom.Conclusion of Section 13Islam is not simply a different perspective on biblical truth; it is amirror image in reverse—a deliberate inversion of the Gospel. It denies the cross, rejects the Son, replaces grace with works, trades resurrection glory for sensual lust, substitutes Muhammad for Christ, and enslaves where Christ frees. This inversion aligns perfectly with satanic strategy: to twist God’s truth into its opposite and lead nations into darkness. Thus, Islam must not be seen as an Abrahamic sibling faith but as theantithesis of the Gospel of Christ.Section 14: The Prophetic Warning Against Islam in ScriptureThe Bible not only proclaims the truth of the Gospel but also forewarns believers about coming deceptions that would oppose Christ. These warnings find clear fulfillment in the rise of Islam, a system that denies Jesus as the Son of God, rejects the cross, and exalts a false prophet. When examined through the lens of prophecy, Islam emerges as one of the greatest fulfillments of biblical warnings against antichrist systems.1. The Spirit of Antichrist (1 John 2:22–23)John writes:“Who is the liar? It is whoever denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a person is the antichrist—denying the Father and the Son. No one who denies the Son has the Father; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also.”Islam explicitly denies Jesus as the Son of God (Quran 4:171, 19:35).By this definition, Islam is not a neutral faith but carries thespirit of antichrist.2. A Different Gospel (Galatians 1:8–9)Paul warns:“If we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let them be under God’s curse.”Islam claims to be revealed by the angel Jibril (Gabriel).Its message contradicts the Gospel by denying the crucifixion and salvation by grace.Thus, Islam falls under Paul’s curse against “another gospel.”3. The Lawless One (2 Thessalonians 2:3–4, 9–10)Paul speaks of theman of lawlessnesswho exalts himself over all that is called God and sets himself up in God’s temple. His coming will be in accordance with Satan’s work, with false signs and wonders.Muhammad exalted himself as the “seal of the prophets” and final messenger, placing his words above Christ’s.His so-called miracles, such as splitting the moon and conversing with jinn, arelying wonders.His law (Sharia) binds millions in oppression, making him a precursor to the lawless system of the Beast.4. The Beast and the False Prophet (Revelation 13, 19:20)Revelation foresees a Beast and a False Prophet who deceive the nations, enforce worship, and receive a mark.The Beast mirrors Islam’s system of enforced submission (Islamitself means submission).The False Prophet aligns with Muhammad, who compelled allegiance to Allah, persecuted dissenters, and spread his message through conquest.The eschatologicalmarkresembles Islamic prophecy about the Beast stamping people, further tying Islam to Revelation’s warnings.5. Warnings About Doctrines of Demons (1 Timothy 4:1)Paul says:“The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons.”Islam originates in Muhammad’s encounters with “revelations” accompanied by convulsions, terror, and voices he feared were demonic.His repeated interactions with jinn (which the Bible identifies as unclean spirits) confirm that Islam’s foundation rests upondoctrines of demons.6. The Rise of a False Peace (Daniel 8:25)Daniel warns of a ruler who will “by peace destroy many.” Islam historically spread by conquest but cloaked itself in the rhetoric of peace (salaam). The promise of peace under Islam is deceptive, for true peace is only found in reconciliation with God through Christ.Conclusion of Section 14Scripture leaves no ambiguity. From John’s warnings about antichrist denial of the Son, to Paul’s condemnation of another gospel, to Revelation’s vision of the False Prophet, the prophetic word consistently points toward systems like Islam. Muhammad’s message fits hand-in-glove with the biblical profile of deception: it denies the Son, proclaims another gospel from an angel, exalts a false prophet, spreads doctrines of demons, and deceives nations under the guise of peace.The Bible did not overlook Islam; it anticipated it. Thus, Christians must recognize Islam not as a parallel path to God, but as aprophetically-foretold counterfeitthat fulfills the warnings of Scripture.Section 15: The Call to Christians in the Face of Islamic DeceptionThe biblical warnings about false prophets, counterfeit gospels, and antichrist systems are not given merely to satisfy theological curiosity. They are given so that the Church maystand firm, discern truth from error, and bear witness to the Gospel of Jesus Christ in a hostile world.In light of Islam’s inversion of the Gospel and fulfillment of prophetic warnings, Christians are called to a threefold response: vigilance, proclamation, and compassion.1. Vigilance in DiscernmentThe Apostle John commands:“Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits, whether they are of God; because many false prophets have gone out into the world”(1 John 4:1). Christians must recognize Islam for what it is—a religion founded upon denial of Christ’s divinity and the corruption of the Gospel. To treat it as a parallel path to God is to ignore the clear testimony of Scripture. Discernment requires courage to call Islam what the Bible calls it: antichrist.2. Boldness in ProclamationThe Apostle Paul declared:“I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes”(Romans 1:16). The only remedy for deception is the truth of Christ crucified and risen. Christians are therefore called to boldly proclaim Jesus as the eternal Son of God, the only Savior, and the final revelation of God. This proclamation must not be watered down to accommodate interfaith harmony but must confront the lie with the truth.3. Compassion for the DeceivedWhile Islam is a system of deception, Muslims themselves are not the enemy—they are captives in need of deliverance. Paul writes:“The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel”(2 Corinthians 4:4). The Church must therefore engage Muslims not with hatred but with the compassion of Christ, praying for their eyes to be opened and their hearts to be freed. Evangelism to Muslims must be coupled with love, patience, and unwavering conviction that only Jesus saves.4. Perseverance in Spiritual WarfarePaul reminds believers:“We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places”(Ephesians 6:12). The rise of Islam is not merely historical or cultural—it is spiritual. Christians must equip themselves with the armor of God, stand firm in prayer, and resist compromise with false religion.Conclusion of Section 15In the face of Islamic deception, Christians are not called to fear but to faithfulness. We must discern the truth of Scripture, proclaim the Gospel with boldness, show compassion to Muslims trapped in error, and persevere in spiritual warfare. Revelation ends with the victory of the Lamb and those who follow Him:“They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony”(Revelation 12:11).The call to the Church is clear: hold fast to Christ, reject counterfeit gospels, and bear witness to the only Savior who is the Way, the Truth, and the Life (John 14:6). In doing so, we expose the lie of Islam and magnify the eternal glory of the Lamb who reigns forever.Conclusion and SummaryThis study has systematically examined Islam through the lens of biblical prophecy, apocalyptic literature, and theological discernment, revealing Islam not as a continuation of divine revelation but as a counterfeit system aligned with end-time deception. Across fifteen sections, we have traced the interconnection between Islamic claims and the eschatological warnings given in the Holy Scriptures, concluding that Islam fulfills the prophetic profile of the Beast system, the false prophet, and the great deception foretold in Revelation and the Pauline epistles.Summary of Key ArgumentsIntroduction to Revelation 13 and Islamic ParallelsRevelation 13 warns of a Beast rising with deceptive power and authority, demanding allegiance through false miracles and blasphemous claims. When read in parallel with Islamic eschatology, particularly in the Qur’an and Hadith traditions, striking similarities emerge.The Beast, the False Witness, and the Mark of IslamIslam introduces concepts of a “Beast from the Earth” (Qur’an 27:82–83), a false witness against humanity (Qur’an 16:84–85), and a mark of allegiance (Qur’an 55:41), directly paralleling Revelation 13:11–18. These connections demonstrate that Islam’s eschatology mirrors, yet distorts, biblical prophecy.The False Prophet in Islamic TextsThe Qur’an and Hadith portray a future eschatological figure, particularly ‘Isa (Islamic Jesus), who denies the crucifixion and divinity of Christ. This “prophet” proclaims an anti-gospel, aligning closely with the False Prophet of Revelation who points the nations away from Christ.The Antichrist System and Islamic TheologyJohn describes Antichrist as one who denies the Father and the Son (1 John 2:22). Islam categorically denies Jesus’ Sonship and the Trinity, placing it firmly within the biblical definition of antichrist.The Mark of the Beast and Islamic SymbolsThe profession of the Shahada, enforced submission, and eschatological allegiance to the Mahdi and Islamic Jesus serve as equivalents to the “mark” in Revelation 13—symbols of ultimate loyalty to a counterfeit god.Islam’s Reversal of Biblical ProphecyIslamic eschatology consistently inverts biblical truths: Christ the returning King becomes subordinate to the Mahdi, the Antichrist becomes the Christian Messiah, and the cross is replaced by denial of crucifixion. This inversion demonstrates satanic mimicry.The Global Dominion of IslamRevelation describes a Beast exercising global dominion. Islam’s long-standing claim of universal submission under sharia, coupled with its expansionist eschatology, mirrors the apocalyptic vision of a religious-political empire seeking world domination.The Deceptive Power of Islamic RevelationMuhammad’s “revelations” bear the marks of deception—ecstatic seizures, contradictory teachings, and denial of Christ’s divinity. This corresponds with Paul’s warning in Galatians 1:8 of a “different gospel” delivered by an angelic messenger.The Role of the Dragon in Empowering IslamRevelation 13 emphasizes the Dragon (Satan) giving power to the Beast. Islam’s denial of Christ and violent enforcement of submission reveal the fingerprints of the Dragon, whose mission is to deceive the nations.The Quran as the Counterfeit ScriptureThe Qur’an positions itself as a “final revelation” while simultaneously undermining the Torah and Gospel. This fulfills the pattern of counterfeit scripture, imitating the form of divine revelation but stripping it of redemptive truth.Muhammad as the False Prophet of RevelationMuhammad fits the biblical profile of the False Prophet: he led people into idolatry of a false god (Allah), rejected Christ’s crucifixion, and validated his authority through coercion and false miracles.The Inversion of Christ’s Gospel in IslamWhere Christ proclaims salvation by grace through His death and resurrection, Islam offers salvation through works, law, and denial of the cross. This inversion is the hallmark of an antichrist gospel.Prophetic Warnings Against Islam in ScriptureThe Bible repeatedly warns of deceivers, false prophets, and systems that exalt themselves against the knowledge of Christ (2 Thessalonians 2; Matthew 24). Islam embodies these warnings, providing a living fulfillment of biblical prophecy.The Christian Response in the Face of Islamic DeceptionBelievers are called not to fear but to stand firm in truth, armed with discernment and the gospel of Jesus Christ. The call is to evangelize Muslims with love while rejecting the falsehood of Islam as a satanic counterfeit.Final ConclusionThe cumulative evidence demonstrates that Islam is not merely another world religion but a prophetically significant system of deception. It parallels the warnings of Revelation 13, mirrors the characteristics of the Beast and False Prophet, and actively denies the central truth of Christianity—the death, resurrection, and divinity of Jesus Christ. As such, Islam represents one of the clearest fulfillments of biblical prophecy concerning the end-time deception.Christians, therefore, must remain vigilant, discerning, and unwavering in the truth of the gospel. The Lamb who was slain is the true Redeemer, and no counterfeit system can prevail against His eternal kingdom. Revelation assures believers of Christ’s ultimate victory: the Beast, the False Prophet, and the Dragon will be cast into the lake of fire (Revelation 20:10). Our confidence rests not in fear of Islam but in the sovereignty of Christ, who has overcome the world.",

    "full_content": "Title: Divine Judgment or Historical Irony? An Examination of Muhammad’s Death in Light of Quranic and Hadith SourcesAuthor: Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological Institute, New York, NYAbstract:This article critically examines the circumstances surrounding the death of Prophet Muhammad by analyzing Quranic revelation, canonical Hadith literature, and historical events such as the raid on Khaibar. It interrogates the theological and prophetic implications of Muhammad’s own testimony regarding his terminal illness, allegedly caused by poison administered after the Khaibar massacre. A striking correlation is drawn between his manner of death and a Quranic passage (Surah 69:44–46), which articulates the punishment that would befall a prophet who falsely attributed revelations to God. This paper challenges Islamic orthodoxy by posing the question: was Muhammad’s death a fulfillment of divine judgment as outlined in the Qur’an?1. IntroductionThe legacy of Prophet Muhammad in Islamic theology is that of theSeal of the Prophets—a man divinely protected and inspired. Yet, there remains a critical and largely avoided episode in Islamic history that continues to spark theological debate: the poisoning incident at Khaibar. This article revisits the historical context of the Jewish settlement of Khaibar, the actions taken by Muhammad and his followers, and his eventual death from long-term complications attributed to poisoning. Through this inquiry, we explore the unsettling yet unavoidable question: did Allah himself end Muhammad’s life in accordance with Qur’anic judgment reserved for false prophets?2. The Raid on Khaibar and Its AftermathIn approximately 629 A.D., Muhammad led a surprise military expedition against the Jewish community of Khaibar. The Muslim biographer Ibn Ishaq and hadith compilers such as Al-Bukhari and Muslim detail the capture, killing, and torture of the Jewish chieftain, Kinana ibn al-Rabi. Kinana was reportedly tortured to disclose hidden wealth, and upon his refusal, he was executed.Following the conquest, a Jewish woman, Zaynab bint Al-Harith, offered Muhammad poisoned meat—an act motivated by vengeance or divine test. Muhammad consumed a portion and immediately sensed the poison but did not expel it fast enough. Although he survived the initial poisoning, he continued to complain of its effects until his death three years later.3. Hadith Evidence: Muhammad’s Own WordsThe most telling admission comes from the Sahih al-Bukhari:*NarratedAisha:**   *\"The Prophet (ﷺ) in his ailment in which he died, used to say, 'OAisha! I still feel the pain caused by the food I ate at Khaibar, and at this time, I feel as if my aorta is being cut from that poison.'\"(Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 4428)This statement is particularly significant as it aligns with a dire warning from the Qur’an:4. Qur'anic Cross-Reference: The Aorta VerseSurah Al-Haqqah (The Reality) 69:44–46 reads:\"And if he (Muhammad) had forged a false saying concerning Us, We surely should have seized him by his right hand; then We certainly would have cut off his aorta.\"This passage clearly outlines divine punishment for any prophet who fabricates revelation. The use of the termaorta(al-watin) in both the Qur’an and Muhammad’s own reported statement is noteworthy and cannot be dismissed as linguistic coincidence. If taken literally, it would imply that Muhammad died under the very judgment described in the Qur’an.5. Theological ImplicationsIf Muhammad’s cause of death corresponds to the Qur’anic warning for false prophets, three possibilities emerge:Muhammad falsely attributed words to Allah and was punished accordingly.The Qur’anic warning was not fulfilled, which would challenge the Qur’an’s own integrity.Or, Muhammad's death was coincidental, and his aortic pain was unrelated to any divine warning—an unlikely proposition given his own testimony.Muslim apologists argue that the verse is metaphorical or the hadith is weak in interpretation. However, both sources—Sahih Bukhariand the Qur’an—are deemed authoritative in Sunni Islam, making such dismissals theologically problematic.6. ConclusionThis analysis brings to light a deeply controversial, yet scripturally and historically rooted dilemma in Islamic theology. The convergence of Muhammad's statement about his poisoning, the historical events at Khaibar, and the Qur’anic criteria for divine punishment of false prophets must prompt honest scholarly dialogue.If we are to take the Qur'an and Hadith literature seriously, then by Muhammad's own words and Allah's own revelation, we are left with an unavoidable question:Was Muhammad's death divinely orchestrated in judgment?Muslim scholars, believers, and critics alike must grapple with this question, as avoiding it does no justice to the integrity of religious scholarship.References:Al-Bukhari,Sahih al-Bukhari, Hadith No. 4428.Ibn Ishaq,Sirat Rasul Allah, trans.

    "full_content": "Title:Textual Dependency and Theological Divergence: A Critical Evaluation of Quranic Appropriations of Biblical NarrativesAuthor:Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute, New York, NYAbstractThis article examines the Quran’s extensive appropriation of Biblical content and its simultaneous theological divergence from Judeo-Christian doctrine. While the Quran purports to be a divine and inerrant revelation in “clear Arabic,” its reworking of key Biblical figures and narratives—such as Mary, the crucifixion, and the Christian doctrine of the Trinity—demonstrates historical confusion and doctrinal misrepresentation. The Quran's dependence on the Bible, juxtaposed with its reconfiguration of Biblical theology, raises critical questions about its claimed independence, authenticity, and divine origin.IntroductionIslamic theology posits the Quran as the final, infallible revelation from Allah, correcting distortions in the Torah, Psalms, and Gospel. Yet, an in-depth analysis of the Quranic text reveals that it leans heavily on earlier Biblical scriptures for characters, stories, and theological frameworks. This dependency becomes problematic when the Quran diverges significantly from both the content and theology of the Bible. This study explores specific examples where the Quran borrows from the Bible but introduces contradictions and historical inaccuracies that undermine its divine claims.1. Quranic Echoes of Biblical NarrativesFrom Adam to Jesus, the Quran recounts stories that are unmistakably derived from Biblical tradition. However, many of these accounts are presented in truncated, ambiguous, or distorted forms. Quranic retellings assume prior knowledge of the stories, indicating a derivative, rather than revelatory, origin. Scholars such as Sidney Griffith and Angelika Neuwirth have highlighted this textual interdependence, noting the Quran’s reliance on extrabiblical Jewish and Christian oral traditions circulating in the Arabian Peninsula during Muhammad’s time.2. Maryam and Miriam: A Genealogical AnachronismA prominent error is the confusion of Mary (mother of Jesus) with Miriam (sister of Moses and Aaron). In Surah Maryam 19:28, Mary is called the “sister of Aaron,” and in Surah At-Tahrim 66:12, she is described as the “daughter of ‘Imran”—the same name given to Moses and Aaron’s father in the Torah (Exodus 6:20). This conflation ignores the historical gap of over 1,400 years between the two women. Islamic apologists have attempted to explain this away as a spiritual or honorary title, yet the textual evidence suggests a deeper historical misunderstanding within the Quranic narrative.3. Denial of the Crucifixion: A Historical and Theological CrisisThe Quran’s assertion that Jesus was neither killed nor crucified (Surah An-Nisa 4:157) stands in direct opposition to historical evidence and the central message of the Christian Gospel. The crucifixion is attested not only by the New Testament but also by non-Christian sources such as Josephus (Antiquities18.3.3), Tacitus (Annals15.44), and the Babylonian Talmud. Rejecting the crucifixion nullifies the salvific message of Christianity and isolates Islam from the foundational truths of Christian theology.4. Misrepresentation of the Trinity as PolytheismThe Quran charges Christians with polytheism (shirk), particularly for their belief in the Trinity (Surah An-Nisa 4:171, Surah Al-Ma’ida 5:73). However, this criticism rests on a fundamental misrepresentation. Christianity affirms monotheism—one God in three persons, not three gods. Moreover, Surah Al-Ma’ida 5:116 appears to assume that Christians worship Mary as part of the Trinity, a doctrine held by no orthodox Christian tradition. This strawman argument reveals a theological misunderstanding incompatible with historical and doctrinal accuracy.5. The Quran’s Theological and Narrative DependenceDespite its claim to supersede previous scriptures, the Quran cannot stand independently of the Bible. Its characters, moral lessons, and eschatological themes are only intelligible when understood through the lens of Judeo-Christian scripture. Paradoxically, while claiming to correct the Bible, the Quran relies upon it for narrative substance. Without the Bible, the Quran's references to figures like Abraham, Joseph, Moses, and Jesus would lack coherence and context.ConclusionThe Quran’s dependence on Biblical material—combined with its distortion of foundational doctrines such as the crucifixion and the Trinity—undermines its claim of divine perfection. The confusion of historical timelines, theological mischaracterizations, and reliance on prior scriptures point not to a transcendent origin, but to a composite text drawn from oral and written traditions prevalent in 7th-century Arabia. Far from confirming the Bible, the Quran appears to borrow from it—and misinterpret it. The Bible stands independently as a coherent and historically anchored revelation. The Quran, however, cannot claim the same without facing its own internal contradictions.ReferencesAyoub, Mahmoud M.Redemptive Suffering in Islam.

    "full_content": "From Zaynab to Zion: The Symbolic and Strategic Role of Women in Jewish-Muslim ConflictsAuthor:Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteAbstract:This article explores the historical and symbolic role of women in Jewish-Muslim conflicts, beginning with the controversial account of the Prophet Muhammad’s alleged poisoning by Zaynab bint Al-Harith, and extending to the modern-day participation of Israeli women in military and intelligence operations. Through theological, historical, and gender studies lenses, the paper interrogates the evolution of female agency from biblical times to contemporary geopolitical warfare, with attention to how religious narratives and military realities intersect in shaping perceptions of power, prophecy, and divine silence.1. IntroductionThe relationship between Jewish and Muslim communities has been shaped by centuries of religious, political, and military tensions. Among the many stories that animate this historical conflict, the account of Muhammad’s poisoning by a Jewish woman, Zaynab bint Al-Harith, stands out for its enduring theological and symbolic implications. In modern times, the prominent role of Israeli women in the military—especially in elite units like Caracal and Bardelas—presents a fascinating reversal of traditional gender narratives and invites reflection on divine justice, martial symbolism, and religious trauma.2. The Death of Muhammad and the Legacy of Zaynab bint Al-HarithIslamic tradition, particularly sources such asIbn Sa'd'sTabaqat al-Kubraandal-Bukhari’s Sahih, record that the Prophet Muhammad was poisoned by a Jewish woman after the Battle of Khaybar (cf. Tabaqat Ibn Sa'd, Vol. 2, p. 249). Zaynab, motivated by vengeance or perhaps suspicion of Muhammad’s prophethood, allegedly served him poisoned lamb. When asked why, she responded: “If you are a prophet, it will not harm you. If you are not, then we are rid of you.”This episode, though contested in terms of historical reliability and theological interpretation, remains a provocative moment in Islamic historiography. Some Muslim scholars view this as a test of prophetic endurance, while others see it as divine martyrdom. Orientalist perspectives have sometimes used this account to critique Islamic conceptions of invincibility and divine protection (cf. Guillaume,The Life of Muhammad, 1967).3. The Emergence of Jewish Women as CombatantsFast forward to the 21st century: Israeli women have increasingly taken on combat and intelligence roles within the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and intelligence agencies like Mossad. Units such asCaracal,Bardelas, andOketzintegrate women into front-line operations, including border security, counter-terrorism, and surveillance missions (Sasson-Levy, 2003). TheMossadalso reportedly employs female agents in high-level espionage and assassination operations, including some allegedly linked to countering Iranian and Palestinian threats (Katz,The Mossad: The Great Operations, 2012).This shift has altered the gender dynamics of conflict, particularly in confrontations with militant Islamist groups who uphold patriarchal ideologies. The irony is stark: men who traditionally oppose female empowerment are increasingly facing skilled, disciplined female adversaries on the battlefield.4. Gender, Warfare, and Asymmetrical PowerFrom a gender studies perspective, the image of Jewish women confronting militant Muslim men offers a rich site for analysis. Scholars such as Cynthia Enloe (2000) and Carol Cohn (2013) have examined how militarized femininity can subvert traditional gender hierarchies. In the case of Israeli military women, their symbolic role challenges Islamist narratives that depict women as subordinate, domestic figures.Moreover, the use of advanced technology—often operated remotely by female personnel—creates a new layer of asymmetrical warfare. Drone warfare, for instance, distances the soldier from the battlefield, yet retains a psychological dominance over targets, especially when filtered through theological or cultural lenses.5. Theological Reflection: Divine Silence or Judgment?The apparent “silence of Allah” during conflicts where Muslim fighters face defeat, especially at the hands of women, raises important theological questions. While some Islamic apologists explain these outcomes as tests of faith, critics may argue that these events reflect a deeper crisis of theological coherence in the face of military and spiritual humiliation.From a Judeo-Christian perspective, the empowerment of women in defending Israel may be interpreted as a fulfillment of biblical prophecies, where daughters of Zion rise as warriors (cf. Judges 4:4–10; Isaiah 31:9). Some Christian Zionists view this as divine vindication in the face of eschatological battles.6. ConclusionThe symbolic continuity from Zaynab bint Al-Harith to modern Israeli female combatants reveals a layered narrative of vengeance, empowerment, and divine irony. While the story of Muhammad’s death by poison remains contested, its symbolic resonance—coupled with the military effectiveness of Jewish women today—offers a rich terrain for exploring how gender, theology, and geopolitics continue to shape Jewish-Muslim interactions.ReferencesGuillaume, A.

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis article critically examines a controversial narration found inMishkat al-Masabih, which suggests that Allah created the descendants of Adam in differing colors, allegedly preassigning white individuals to Paradise and black individuals to Hell. This analysis addresses the theological, ethical, and moral implications of such racial determinism within Islamic doctrine. It raises fundamental questions about divine justice, racial equality, and the attributes of God as both merciful and just. The article seeks to explore whether such a narrative aligns with the broader teachings of Islam or represents a later sociopolitical interpolation incompatible with a just and omnibenevolent deity.IntroductionIslam claims universality and racial equality, exemplified by verses in the Qur’an that emphasize moral conduct over ethnicity:“Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you.”(Qur’an 49:13)Yet, certain Hadiths, particularly the narration inMishkat al-Masabih, appear to contradict this inclusive ethic. The Hadith in question states:“Allah created Adam, then wiped his back, and there fell from his back every soul that He would create until the Day of Resurrection. He made some of them white and some black. Then He said: ‘To Paradise and I do not care,’ and ‘To Hell and I do not care.’”This narration, which has deeply racial overtones, raises profound theological concerns. If Allah predetermined black people to Hell and white people to Paradise, how can this be reconciled with Islamic assertions of divine justice and accountability?Historical Context and Textual ReliabilityThe Hadith in question is not found inSahih al-BukhariorSahih Muslim, the most authoritative Hadith collections in Sunni Islam, but appears inMishkat al-Masabih, which draws from various earlier compilations, includingMusnad AhmadandSunan al-Tirmidhi. This calls for an immediate investigation into theauthenticity (ṣaḥīḥ), chain of transmission (isnād), and content integrity (matn)of the narration.Was this Hadith genuinely attributed to the Prophet Muhammad, or was it a later fabrication echoing the racial hierarchies of early Islamic empires or Abbasid racial theory?Theological Implications1.Divine Justice vs. Arbitrary DamnationIf Allah predetermined black people for Hell simply based on their skin color, this challenges the Islamic concept ofAdl(divine justice). According to the Qur’an:“Every soul earns not [blame] except against itself, and no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another.”(Qur’an 6:164)This verse affirmsindividual moral responsibility. The idea that skin color alone can determine eternal damnation undermines this teaching and presents Allah as capricious—a concept rejected by Islamic theology.2.Free Will and Predestination (Qadar)Islamic thought has long wrestled with the tension between divine decree (qadar) and human free will. If racial identity predetermines one’s eternal fate, then human agency is rendered meaningless. How then can individuals be held accountable for what they neither chose nor can change?3.Ethical Monotheism vs. Racial DeterminismThe Qur’anic vision is one ofethical monotheism, where moral conduct, piety, and belief determine salvation—not ethnicity or lineage:“O mankind, We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another.”(Qur’an 49:13)To suggest that blackness itself is a marker of divine rejection is to align Islam with a form ofracial fatalism, incompatible with this verse.Comparative Religious ReflectionThis narrative mirrors other ancient worldviews in which pigmentation was linked to spiritual destiny—such as Gnostic doctrines of light vs. darkness, or certain interpretations in Hindu caste systems. However, monotheistic religions—including authentic Islam, Christianity, and Judaism—typically root divine judgment inmoral action, not melanin levels.Racism and Hadith: Social Construct or Divine Design?There is scholarly consensus thatsome Hadiths were fabricatedfor political, sectarian, or cultural motives. The Umayyad and Abbasid periods saw increased Arab supremacy narratives that often denigrated non-Arabs and darker-skinned peoples. Is this Hadith an expression of suchracial elitismrather than divine revelation?If the Prophet Muhammad truly said this, then his own multiethnic community, which included black companions like Bilal ibn Rabah, is inexplicable. Bilal was honored by Muhammad and described as having a voice that would precede him in Paradise. Such examples contradict the Hadith's implications.The Moral Problem of a Racist GodThis leads to the ultimate theological question:Can God be racist?If so, then God ceases to be morally perfect, and religion loses its claim to universal ethics. For any true faith to maintain credibility, it must offera vision of salvationthat transcends ethnicity, race, and national origin.ConclusionThe Hadith portraying black people as destined for Hell is not onlytheologically inconsistentwith core Islamic teachings but alsomorally reprehensible. It must be questioned, critiqued, and likely rejected as afabricated artifactof human prejudice—not divine decree.To accept such a Hadith without scrutiny is to do violence to the very nature of God as Just, Merciful, and Righteous. Islam must be disentangled from cultural racism to remain a credible moral force in the modern world.ReferencesQur’an 49:13, 6:164Mishkat al-Masabih, Book of FaithAl-Tabari,Tarikh al-Rusul wa al-MulukJonathan A.C.

While proponents claim divine origin for such practices, a careful exegesis of both biblical and Islamic sources reveals cultural impositions rather than divine mandates. By examining the portrayal of women in the Bible—particularly Sarah, Ruth, Esther, and Mary—this paper argues that female visibility, dignity, and agency are inherent in God’s design. Furthermore, the Christian moral framework places the responsibility for lust and immorality not on women's visibility but on individual moral discipline. This paper challenges the notion that extreme veiling is a reflection of divine holiness, instead exposing it as a cultural mechanism of control rooted in patriarchal interpretation.1. IntroductionIn recent Islamic discourse, particularly within conservative jurisprudence, female veiling is presented as a divine requirement—a symbol of piety and social order. However, upon theological scrutiny, this practice appears more aligned with patriarchal cultural control than with divine ordinance. The Quranic justification is often vague, and the Hadith literature provides troubling implications about gender roles and public decency.2. Biblical Portrayal of Women and VisibilityThe Bible consistently presents women as visible, active participants in society and God’s redemptive narrative. In Genesis 12:11–13, Sarah’s beauty is acknowledged publicly. While Abraham expresses fear, the response is deception—not concealment—underscoring the cultural tension but not prescribing veiling. Ruth wins Boaz’s favor while gleaning publicly in the field (Ruth 2:2–12), and Esther enters a royal beauty contest with her appearance on full display (Esther 2:7–17). These examples demonstrate that women were neither expected to be hidden nor shamed for their beauty.Even Mary, the mother of Jesus, wore traditional modest attire consistent with Jewish customs (Luke 1:27), but there is no scriptural or historical evidence that she wore a full face veil or lived in social seclusion. Her visibility and mobility are assumed throughout the Gospel narratives (Luke 1:39–56; John 2:1–5).3. Islamic Veiling: Qur’anic and Hadith FoundationsWhile proponents of the burqa cite verses like Surah An-Nur (24:31) and Al-Ahzab (33:59), these passages mention modesty and covering the bosom but do not explicitly mandate full facial concealment or garments resembling isolation. The Quranic instruction is vague, and interpretations vary widely among Islamic scholars.However, many Hadiths present more rigid expectations. For instance,Sunan Abu Dawood 641states:\"Asma, daughter of Abu Bakr, entered upon the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) wearing thin clothes. The Messenger turned his face and said: ‘O Asma’, when a girl reaches menstruating age, it is not proper that anything should remain exposed except this and this.’ He pointed to his face and hands.\"Ironically, even this Hadith contradicts the burqa, as it permits the visibility of the face and hands—undermining claims that the burqa is divinely mandated.4. Apostolic Teaching on Head CoveringsChristian opponents of veiling often encounter Muslims citing1 Corinthians 11:5–6, where Paul discusses head coverings for women. However, a contextual reading shows that Paul is addressing worship conduct within church gatherings—not public dress codes. Moreover, Paul refers only to covering thehead, not theface, and makes no reference to bodily obscuration. His concern is theological symbolism within the Corinthian church, not a universal dress code (Keener, 2014).5. Theological and Ethical ImplicationsJesus Christ rebuked those who enforced human traditions as divine commands:“They worship me in vain; their teachings are merely human rules. You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to human traditions” (Mark 7:7–8, NIV).The excessive veiling of women under Islamic law falls within the purview of man-made tradition rather than God-breathed commandment. In Christian theology, morality is grounded not in controlling others’ visibility but in cultivating internal holiness (Matthew 5:27–30). It is the lustful heart that is condemned, not the female presence.6. ConclusionScripture does not support the erasure of women through full veiling practices. Rather, it affirms their dignity, presence, and purpose in society. The burden of moral conduct is not on a woman’s concealment but on every individual's discipline and submission to God. Christianity liberates women from cultural impositions masquerading as divine commands. Any religious practice that seeks to erase, hide, or diminish half of humanity must be evaluated not by its cultural defensibility but by its theological legitimacy.BibliographyAl-Qur'an.

It critically assesses the implications of certain Islamic scriptures on gender roles, autonomy, and dignity from a Judeo-Christian theological and anthropological perspective. While recognizing the diversity of Islamic interpretations, this analysis underscores the systemic gender imbalance embedded in classical Islamic thought, arguing that it falls short of recognizing women as fully human agents created in the image of God.IntroductionIn the Abrahamic religious traditions, the question of gender equity remains a central theological and ethical concern. Islam, the second largest religion globally, offers a particular worldview on gender roles rooted in Qur’anic texts and the Sunnah (Prophet Muhammad’s traditions). While modern Islamic apologists and reformers have attempted to reinterpret many of these texts in egalitarian terms, a critical reading of foundational sources reveals persistent anthropological reductionism in the depiction of women. This paper aims to demonstrate that such portrayals not only diminish the spiritual and intellectual dignity of women but also contradict the ethical framework of human worth found in other monotheistic traditions.I. Women as “Tilth”: A Textual Exegesis of Qur’an 2:223The Qur’an in Surah al-Baqarah 2:223 states:“Your wives are a tilth for you; so go to your tilth [when] however you will...” (Qur’an 2:223, Sahih International).The metaphor of a woman astilth(Arabic: حرث) denotes agricultural land to be plowed and sown—conveying reproductive utility. Classical Islamic jurists interpreted this verse as a divine sanction for male sexual access and dominance (Ibn Kathir,Tafsir al-Qur’an al-Azim; Al-Tabari,Jamiʿ al-bayan). While some modern scholars argue for metaphorical interpretations (Esack, 2005), the overwhelming historical consensus regards women as reproductive vessels. The woman’s body, in this view, is a field—a passive object—while the man assumes the role of the active farmer. This sexualized agricultural analogy imposes utilitarianism upon womanhood, fundamentally reducing the female body to a biological function.II. Intellectual Inferiority in Hadith TraditionThe Hadith literature contains repeated references to women’s alleged intellectual and moral inferiority. Sahih al-Bukhari records the Prophet Muhammad as saying:“I have not seen anyone more deficient in intelligence and religion than you [women]” (Sahih al-Bukhari, Book 6, Hadith 301).The Hadith claims that women are intellectually deficient due to their emotional nature and religiously deficient due to exemptions from prayer and fasting during menstruation. Classical commentators like Al-Ghazali (Ihya Ulum al-Din) and Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani (Fath al-Bari) accepted this framework uncritically. This theological anthropology constructs a gendered hierarchy of intellect and piety, which has often justified gender-based educational deprivation in many Muslim-majority societies.III. Gendered Modesty and The Erasure of Female PresenceQur’an 33:59 commands:“O Prophet, tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to bring down over themselves [part] of their outer garments...” (Qur’an 33:59, Sahih International).This verse, combined with traditional Hadiths such as Abu Dawud 32:4092 and Bukhari 8:74:257, is interpreted by many jurists as requiring women to cover their entire bodies, including the face, hands, and voice in public. The reasoning often revolves around the notion of male sexual weakness and the need to prevent societalfitna(chaos). The outcome, however, is the erasure of the female face from the public sphere—an anthropological anomaly among world religions. Muslim women, in some cultures, are discouraged from speaking, eating in public, or expressing emotion lest they provoke male arousal. The woman becomes not a person but a potentialfitnato be veiled, silenced, and secluded.IV. Theological Implications: From Personhood to MechanismWhen religious doctrine reduces a woman to a womb (rahim), a field (harth), and a temptation (fitna), the implications are deeply dehumanizing. The Qur’an and Hadith construct a theological anthropology in which women are not independent moral agents but extensions of male will and divine reproduction. If women exist primarily for childbearing and obedience, then their emotional, intellectual, and spiritual dimensions are sidelined. In essence, the portrayal resembles that of a programmed reproductive mechanism rather than a fully realized person.V. Contrasting with the Biblical View of WomanhoodThe Judeo-Christian tradition presents a stark contrast. In Genesis 1:27, the human being—male and female—is createdimago Dei(in the image of God). Eve is described not as farmland but as a helper suitable (ezer kenegdo)—an equal partner (Genesis 2:18). Proverbs 31 exalts the wisdom, strength, and enterprise of a virtuous woman. In the New Testament, women are the first witnesses to the Resurrection (Luke 24), recipients of spiritual gifts (Acts 2:17), and equal heirs of salvation (Galatians 3:28). This theological anthropology affirms womanhood in its fullness—spiritual, rational, emotional, and vocational.ConclusionWhile Islamic sources contain some verses advocating kindness and respect toward women, the dominant theological and hermeneutical framework portrays women as functional tools—be it for reproduction, pleasure, or temptation-avoidance. Such a worldview reduces personhood to utility and violates the dignity inherent in all humans created in the image of God. If Islam's conception of womanhood is to be redeemed, it must transcend the mechanistic, reproductive metaphor and affirm the holistic personhood of women as moral, intellectual, and spiritual equals.ReferencesAl-Tabari.Jamiʿ al-Bayan fi Ta'wil al-Qur'an.

A Theological Analysis of Jinn in Islam and the Christian Prohibition of Communion with Evil SpiritsBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba | Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis article critically examines the Islamic conception of Jinn and their theological relationship with humans—particularly Muslims—as depicted in the Hadith literature and the Qur'an. Drawing on primary Islamic sources, such asSahih MuslimandJami' at-Tirmidhi, alongside Qur’anic references like Surah Al-A’raf (7:202), this paper highlights a significant contrast between Islamic acceptance of interaction with Jinn and the biblical injunction against all communion with demons. The Christian Scriptures—particularly the Pauline epistles and Gospel narratives—portray demons as unclean spirits, completely opposed to God and unfit for any fellowship. The article thus asserts that Islam’s implicit fraternal relationship with Jinn contradicts the clear separation between light and darkness upheld in biblical theology.IntroductionThe presence and influence of supernatural beings are acknowledged across many religious traditions. In Islam,Jinn—invisible beings created from smokeless fire—are a core part of Islamic cosmology. However, their theological relationship with Muslims, as represented in both Hadith and Qur’anic texts, poses a significant contrast with the biblical worldview. While Islam accommodates interaction, even respect, for Jinn, Christianity categorically forbids any relationship with demonic beings, identifying them as agents of Satan and enemies of God.This article will explore:Islamic texts which suggest a form of \"brotherhood\" or affinity between Muslims and Jinn;Qur’anic references where devils are called “brothers” to humans;The Christian biblical teaching that absolutely forbids all communion with demons; andThe Christological authority over demons as the basis for Christian deliverance.1. The Brotherhood Between Muslims and Jinn in Islamic TraditionInSahih Muslim 450a, the Prophet Muhammad warns his followers:\"Do not perform istinja (ritual cleaning) with dung or bones, for they are the food of your brothers among the Jinn.\"This statement explicitly refers to the Jinn as the “brothers” of Muslims. In Islamic cosmology, Jinn are rational beings endowed with free will, capable of choosing between good and evil, and are subject to divine judgment like humans. This anthropomorphic parallel creates an ontological and theological nearness between humans and Jinn that opens the door to religious and social familiarity.Likewise,Jami’ at-Tirmidhi 3258reinforces the idea:“They are the provision for your brothers among the Jinn.”These narrations establish not only interaction but communal care, where humans are instructed to preserve certain materials (like bones) for the sustenance of Jinn. Such instructions go beyond mere coexistence and suggest a degree of spiritual or religious fraternity.2. The Qur’an and Jinn as Brothers in ErrorInSurah Al-A’raf 7:202, the Qur'an notes:“But their brothers—the devils—increase them in error, then they do not stop short.”(Sahih International)“As for their brethren [the Satans], they draw them deeper into error.”(Maududi)Here, the Qur’anic depiction confirms a \"brotherhood\" between humans and devils (shayatin). The term “akhwānuhum” (their brothers) used in the Arabic denotes intimate moral or spiritual affinity, not mere metaphor. Thus, the Qur’an itself implicitly sanctions the idea that humans may have relational or behavioral alignment with devils—a notion foreign and heretical from a biblical standpoint.3. Christian Teaching: Absolute Separation from DemonsThe New Testament categorically forbids any interaction with demonic forces. Paul, writing to the Corinthians, says:“You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons too; you cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons.”(1 Corinthians 10:21, NLT)This warning sets a clear moral and spiritual dichotomy between God’s people and demonic entities. No spiritual brotherhood or alliance is ever permitted. Furthermore, demons are portrayed as utterly deceptive, destructive, and subject to divine judgment.4. Christ's Authority Over DemonsThe Gospels present Jesus Christ as having total authority over demons, who tremble at His presence:“The demons kept begging Jesus not to send them into the bottomless pit.”(Luke 8:31, NLT)This verse demonstrates not only the fear demons have of Christ but also reinforces the Christian belief that demons are in direct opposition to the Son of God. No Christian would ever claim demons as spiritual brethren. Rather, they are enemies of righteousness, to be cast out in Jesus’ name (Mark 16:17).Conclusion: Contrasting WorldviewsIslam’s view of the Jinn as “brothers,” whether metaphorical or literal, reveals a theological openness that significantly diverges from the biblical worldview. Christianity, rooted in the authority of Scripture and the person of Jesus Christ, recognizes demons as fallen beings, entirely opposed to God’s kingdom. The moral implications are significant:In Islam, interaction and recognition of Jinn as spiritual kin is recorded in both the Hadith and Qur’an.In Christianity, any such relationship is categorically condemned and seen as spiritual adultery.This theological divide reveals deeper questions about the nature of divine revelation, the spiritual realm, and humanity's relationship to the unseen. Christians are called to spiritual purity, resisting the devil (James 4:7) and remaining sanctified through Christ. Islam, by contrast, presents a framework where fellowship with Jinn is conceivable—even commendable.BibliographyAl-Bukhari, Muhammad ibn Ismail.Sahih al-Bukhari.Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj.Sahih Muslim 450a.https://sunnah.com/muslim:450aAt-Tirmidhi, Muhammad ibn Isa.Jami’ at-Tirmidhi 3258.https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:3258The Qur’an, Surah Al-A’raf (7:202).

    "full_content": "Title: Questioning Muhammad’s Interaction with Jinns: A Theological and Biblical CritiqueBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis academic and theological article investigates the Islamic claim that the prophet Muhammad interacted with Jinns—spiritual beings identified in Islamic belief as capable of conversion to Islam. Such interactions are fundamentally inconsistent with the teachings of the Bible, where all prophets, under the authority of the One True God, cast out demons and rebuked evil spirits. This study critically analyzes Quranic passages, compares them with Biblical theology, and raises pressing questions about Muhammad’s prophethood, his divine commission, and the nature of Allah in contrast to the God of the Bible. If Muhammad befriended and taught Jinns instead of casting them out, it calls into question whether he was truly sent by the Holy God of the Bible.IntroductionIslamic tradition upholds the account of Muhammad preaching to and converting Jinns to Islam. This claim is based on several Quranic references, particularly Surah al-Jinn and Surah Ah’kaf. Unlike the prophets of the Bible who never sought fellowship with demons or unclean spirits, Muhammad’s engagement with Jinns raises severe theological red flags. This paper seeks to highlight the contradictions between Muhammad’s actions and the pattern of Biblical prophethood, examining whether such behavior aligns with the God who declared in Leviticus 19:31:\"Do not turn to mediums or seek out spiritists, for you will be defiled by them. I am the Lord your God.\"1.The Biblical Stance on Jinns (Demons): Absolute RejectionIn both Old and New Testaments, demons (equivalent to Jinns in Islamic terminology) are consistently portrayed as unclean, deceptive, and destructive. The prophets of God did not dialogue with them but cast them out through divine authority. Consider:Jesus Christ’s Ministry:“And he healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons” (Mark 1:34).“He gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases” (Luke 9:1).Prophets like Moses, Elijah, and Elishanever communicated with evil spirits but strictly condemned all spiritualistic practices.Isaiah 8:19–“When someone tells you to consult mediums and spiritists, who whisper and mutter, should not a people inquire of their God?”If God’s true messengers strictly opposed interaction with unclean spirits, how could Muhammad—a man who claimed prophethood—spend the entire night preaching to Jinns and accepting their allegiance?2.Islamic Accounts of Muhammad’s Interaction with JinnsIslamic texts describe Muhammad being approached by Jinns who listened to his recitation of the Qur’an and embraced Islam. Notably:Surah al-Jinn (72:1-2):“A group of the Jinn listened and said: ‘We have heard a wonderful recitation... so we have believed in it.’”Surah Ah’kaf (46:29):“We directed a group of Jinns to you to listen to the Qur’an…”Laylatul Jinn: The night Muhammad claimed he was teaching a group of Jinns over the mountain, away from his companions, and even ate with them.These narratives show a stark contrast to the character and methods of Biblical prophets, who were filled with the Holy Spirit and rebuked such spirits.3.The Theological Dissonance: Allah and the God of the Bible Are Not the SameThe God of the Bible is Holy, and His prophets were set apart from the unclean world of spirits. Allah, as presented in the Qur’an, seems permissive of spiritual interaction that is otherwise condemned in Biblical revelation. Key contradictions include:God’s Holiness vs. Allah’s Association:“What fellowship can light have with darkness?” (2 Corinthians 6:14)Demons Recognize God but Are Not Converted:“You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe—and shudder!” (James 2:19)The notion ofconverting demons to righteousnessis alien to the Bible. Demons acknowledge the authority of Jesus but are judged, not saved. Therefore, the claim that Jinns became “Muslim” under Muhammad indicates that the god they turned to is not the Holy God of Israel.4.Critical Questions That Demand Scholarly AttentionA. If Muhammad taught Jinns, why did he not cast them out in the power of God, as all Biblical prophets did?B. Why did the Qur’an not affirm the holiness and complete otherness of God by rejecting all interaction with spiritual beings?C. Why is there no record of any Biblical prophet ever being aided or receiving followers among demons?D. If Muhammad’s prophetic call was from the God of Abraham, why do his actions directly contradict Yahweh’s commands?E. How can one reconcile the Islamic claim of continuity with the Bible when Muhammad’s ministry diverges so dramatically in spiritual doctrine and practice?F. Why did Allah allow interaction with spirit beings that the God of the Bible explicitly callsan abomination?G. If the Jinns accepted Islam, does that mean demons can be righteous? Is this not a reversal of God’s established moral and spiritual order?H. Does this not make Muhammad not only a teacher of men but also a shepherd of demons?I. Why did the Qur’an contradict the Bible’s teaching on demonology yet claim to confirm the previous Scriptures (Surah 5:46)?5.Conclusion: A Prophet of Another Spirit?The interaction between Muhammad and the Jinns poses a significant theological dilemma. It is a departure from the Biblical pattern of holiness, authority, and separation from the spiritual forces of darkness. This paper concludes that such interaction is not a mark of divine approval but rather of spiritual compromise. The God of the Bible stands opposed to all forms of demonic engagement, while Muhammad's reported encounters reflect an entirely different spiritual paradigm.The spirit behind Muhammad’s ministry, therefore, must be re-evaluated in light of Scripture:“Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God...” (1 John 4:1)The conclusion is unmistakable:Muhammad’s interaction with Jinns places his prophethood in question and reveals that the Allah he served is not the Holy God of the Bible.By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaPresident, Shimba Theological Institutewww.shimbatheology.org",

One verse on the subject reads:Say: \"It has been revealed to me that a band of the jinn listened and said, 'We have heard a most amazing Recitation. It leads to right guidance so we believe in it and will not associate anyone with our Lord.'\" Surah al-Jinn: 1-2In that same Surah, Allah also reveals that some Jinn are actually Muslims:[The Jinn said]: \"And when we heard the guidance, we believed in it. Anyone who believes in his Lord need fear neither belittlement nor tyranny. Some of us are Muslims and some are deviators. Those who have become Muslim are those who sought right guidance.\" Surah al-Jinn: 13-14When the servant of Allah stands calling on Him, they almost swarm all over him. Surah al-Jinn: 19Yet another verse recounts that when the Prophet ﷺ gave guidance regarding Deen, the jinn would gather around him and listen carefully:And [mention, O Muhammad], when We directed to you a few of the jinn, listening to the Qur'an. And when they attended it, they said, \"Listen quietly.\" And when it was concluded, they went back to their people as warners. Surah Ah’kaf- 29These verses make it clear that Prophet Muhammad ﷺ was sent as a Prophet for all mankind and the jinn. The Qur'an is a guide for both mankind and the Jinn.When the Jinns invited the Prophet ﷺ to their colonyOnce the Prophet ﷺ visited Taif to invite the people to Islam. He wanted to talk to the people of the town to invite them to Islam but they all shut their doors on his face and rejected him. Zaid bin Haris (May Allah be pleased with him) was his Companion. Both of them went to their leader, who rejected them as well. He asked his slaves and young boys to drive them away.. They threw stones at them to drive them out of the town. Both of them were injured. Our Prophet ﷺ bled so much that his shoes were filled with his blood and got stuck to his feet. The Prophet ﷺ felt dizzy .Zaid (May Allah be pleased with him) said, “I helped the Prophet ﷺ to leave the village and we rested under a tree.” Both men then returned to Makkah. On the way, at Watane Nakhla, Prophet ﷺ woke up to offer Tahajjud and recited the Qur’an.The Jinns of that time had noticed that they could not cross over the heavens and hear the conversations of the angels anymore, rather they were chased by meteors and were driven away. Their leader instructed them to find out the reason so they wandered around. There was a valley called Nasibi which was inhibited by Jinns. These Jinns passed by the place at night when they heard the recitation. The group heard the melodious recitation of our Prophet ﷺ and were entranced. Without the knowledge of our Prophet ﷺ that group of Jinn accepted Islam. It was then the above verses of Surah Jinn were revealed. The point to be noted is that the humans of Taif rejected the Message of Allah but the Jinn accepted it. Allah truly does not let the efforts of the Believers go in vain.Once the Prophet ﷺ was sitting with his Companions. He had to go to attend the call of nature. He went a bit farther and did not return for a long time. The Companions were worried about his absence and feared that he had been abducted. They searched for him the whole night. In the morning, the Prophet ﷺ returned. When the Companions inquired, he replied, “I was called by a group of Jinns over that mountain, who had embraced Islam and wanted to learn the religion from me. It took me the whole night to teach them”. This night is called “Laylatul Jinn”. The Companions then went along him to the place and saw burnt sticks and ash which indicated that food was cooked that night. Therefore, it is essential to believe that the Prophet ﷺ was sent even to the Jinn.WRITE ACADEMIC RESEARCH AND SCHOLARLY ARTICLE QUESTIONING MUHAMMAD INTERACTED WITH JINNS WHICH IS AGAINST THE GOD OF THE BIBLEALL PROPHETS AND MESSENGERS WERE AGAINST JINNS AND CASTOUT JINNS BUT MUHAMMAD CONVERTED THEM TO ISLAMTHAT MEANS ALLAH IS NOT GOD OF THE BIBLEQURAN DOES NOT AFFIRMS THE PREVIOUS BOOKSMUHAMMAD WAS A PROPHET OF NOT THE GOD WHO IS AGAINST JINNSADD MORE QUESTION TO THE ARTICLE QUESTIONING MUHAMMAD PROPHETHOODBy Dr Maxwell Shimba from Shimba Theological Institute",

    "full_content": "Title: Theological Inquiries into the Islam of the Jinn: Prophethood, Revelation, and the Ummah of the UnseenBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstract:The Qur'an asserts the existence of Jinn as intelligent, moral beings created from smokeless fire and capable of belief and disbelief. Notably,Surah al-Jinn (72:13–14)describes a group of Jinn who heard the Qur'anic message, believed in it, and identified themselves as Muslims. This passage raises complex theological and doctrinal questions regarding the prophetic dispensation to the Jinn, the role of Muhammad in their salvation history, and the consistency of Qur'anic claims about each nation (ummah) receiving its own prophet and scripture. This article aims to critically explore these tensions and offer a framework for theological debate within Islamic and interreligious studies.1. Introduction: The Jinn as Believers and Moral Agents in IslamIn Islamic theology, Jinn are supernatural beings with free will, capable of good and evil, much like humans. They are accountable to God and are subject to the same eschatological destiny: either Paradise or Hell. According toSurah al-Jinn, a group of Jinn heard the Qur’an and believed, becoming Muslims. However, this account introduces a number of unresolved theological issues when examined in light of broader Qur'anic doctrine regarding prophecy and scripture:“We sent a messenger to every nation…”(Qur’an 16:36)“And for every nation is a messenger…”(Qur’an 10:47)If eachummah(nation or community) is to receive a prophet and scripture, then who was sent to the Jinn? And if Muhammad was their prophet, how does this reconcile with the principle that each community has its own specific messenger?2. Who Is the Prophet of the Jinn?The Qur’an never explicitly names a prophet sentexclusivelyto the Jinn. The story inSurah al-Jinnsuggests that the Jinn came into contact with the message of Muhammad indirectly—by overhearing his recitation or through attending gatherings where the Qur’an was proclaimed.Questions arising:If the Jinn were a distinct ummah, why were they not given their own prophet, as the Qur’an consistently claims happens with every nation?Is Muhammad to be considered the prophet of both humans and Jinn? If so, why was there no direct da’wah (prophetic outreach) to the Jinn recorded in detail in Hadith or Qur’anic narrative?Does this imply a shared ummah between humans and Jinn, or a blurring of Qur'anic theological boundaries?3. Was a Book Revealed to the Jinn?Nowhere in the Qur’an is it stated that the Jinn were given a separate scripture. TheJinn who accepted Islamdid so after hearingthe Qur’an, a text revealed to a human prophet, Muhammad ibn Abdullah. This raises further theological concerns:Key Questions:If the Qur’an is for humans, and yet Jinn can benefit from it, is it a universal book for all intelligent beings?Alternatively, is there a lost or hidden revelation specifically for the Jinn?How does Islamic theology explain the moral guidance of the Jinn prior to Muhammad’s time?Could there have been prophets or scriptures specifically for Jinn that are unmentioned or lost?The silence of the Qur’an on these matters opens the door for speculative theology but also underscores potential inconsistencies within Islamic revelatory logic.4. Did the Jinn Say the Shahada? Who Is Their Rasul?Islamic orthodoxy affirms that entry into Islam requires reciting theShahada:“There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is His Messenger.”The Jinn inSurah al-Jinnare said to have “believed” upon hearing the Qur’an. But:Did they formally declare the Shahada?Is Muhammad their rasul (messenger)?Or did they accept the Tawheed (monotheism) but without embracing Muhammad’s prophethood?If Muhammad is their messenger, how can this be reconciled with their separate ontological category as beings made from fire, existing outside of direct human society?This brings forth the critical issue:Is Muhammad theuniversal prophet, including over angels and Jinn, or is his message primarily anthropocentric?5. Contemporary Interactions: Do Muslims Interact with Jinn Today?Various traditions within Islam—particularly Sufi and folk Islam—contain accounts of Muslim scholars and saints interacting with Jinn. Some scholars are said to have taught Islam to Jinn or led them in prayer. In contrast, orthodox Islamic theology generally discourages attempts to summon or interact with Jinn due to the risk of engaging with deceitful or malevolent beings.Questions for modern inquiry:Do Jinn read the Qur’an or attend mosques?Do they perform the five pillars of Islam?How do Jinn establish their own ummah and jurisprudence?Can a human scholar issue fatwas for Jinn?Hadiths such as those inSahih MuslimandTafsir Ibn Kathirdiscuss Jinn listening to the Qur'an and speaking with the Prophet, but again, these remain isolated and ambiguous reports.6. The Problem of Doctrinal Consistency: Contradiction or Mystery?If every nation has its own prophet and book (Qur’an 35:24; 10:47), and if Jinn are morally accountable, then the Qur’anic silence on their specific messengers or books seems theologically inconsistent.Is this a contradiction? Or an area of divine mystery?Does the absence of a Jinn prophet in Islamic scripture represent a contradiction in divine justice?Or does it suggest that Muhammad's prophethood is so expansive that it includes both realms—seen and unseen?If Muhammad is the universal messenger, why was his da’wah to Jinn indirect and passive rather than intentional and specific?7. Conclusion: Open Questions and Areas for Further StudyThe topic of Muslim Jinn invites more questions than answers and remains an underexplored area in Islamic theology. For theologians, scholars, and students of comparative religion, this topic challenges assumptions about:The boundaries of prophethoodThe universality of divine guidanceThe consistency of God’s justice across different beingsUntil further Qur’anic exegesis or Hadith analysis resolves these tensions, the theological identity of the Muslim Jinn remainsambiguous,debated, andrich for scholarly discourse.Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteContact:info@shimbatheology.org",

Drawing onSahih Bukhari,Tabaqat Ibn Sa'd, and Qur’anic verses such as Surah Al-Haqqah (69:44–47), this study seeks to assess whether Muhammad’s own words and the circumstances surrounding his death align with the Quranic standard for true prophethood or provide internal evidence pointing to false prophecy.IntroductionThroughout history, the legitimacy of prophetic claims has been subject to both internal and external tests. The Quran presents a litmus test for authentic prophets: they must not fabricate revelations in the name of Allah. If they do, divine retribution is promised. This paper examines the death of Muhammad as described in canonical Islamic texts and raises the question—did Muhammad’s own death by poison fulfill the Quran’s divine criteria for exposing a false prophet?1.Context: The Poisoning at KhaybarAccording toTabaqat Ibn Sa'd(vol. 2, pp. 249–252), a Jewish woman in Khaybar attempted to poison Muhammad after the Muslim conquest of her community. She offered poisoned meat, explicitly stating her motive:“I wanted to see if you were a prophet. If you are, it would not harm you. If not, I would relieve the people from you.”(Tabaqat Ibn Sa'd, p. 249)This statement frames the event as a divine test—a challenge that the Prophet’s survival would vindicate his divine protection and legitimacy, whereas death would signify divine rejection.2.Quranic Criteria for a False Prophet: Surah Al-Haqqah 69:44–47The Quran itself issues a stern warning to anyone who might fabricate revelations:“And if he had made up about Us some [false] sayings, We would have seized him by the right hand, then We would have cut from him the aorta (jugular vein). And none of you could prevent Us from doing so.”(Quran 69:44–47)This verse establishes a standard: if Muhammad were a false prophet, Allah would personally ensure his death by cutting hisaortaorjugular vein—a physical, painful form of divine judgment.3.Muhammad's Own Confession Before DeathThree years after the poisoning incident, during his terminal illness, Muhammad himself drew a connection between his suffering and the poisoned meat:\"O Aisha! I still feel the pain caused by the food I ate at Khaybar, and at this time, I feel as if my aorta is being cut from that poison.\"(Sahih Bukhari, Vol. 5, Book 59, Hadith 713)A nearly identical statement is recorded inTabaqat Ibn Sa'd(p. 252):“The Messenger of Allah lived for three years after that until the poison made him so ill that he died… now I feel that the time has come for my jugular vein to be cut.”Muhammad’s own declaration, using the precise phrase “cutting of the jugular vein,” mirrors the terminology in Quran 69:46.4.Scholarly AnalysisIf we apply the Quranic criteria rigorously, this confession raises serious theological implications:Language Symmetry: The Quranic warning (“cut his jugular vein”) is precisely mirrored in Muhammad’s deathbed words.Theological Irony: The very test that the Jewish woman posed—whether the poison would affect a true prophet—was seemingly confirmed by Muhammad's prolonged suffering and eventual death.No Miraculous Healing: Unlike biblical prophets who were divinely healed or delivered, Muhammad succumbed to the poison over time, which calls into question the traditional claim of prophetic immunity.5.Conclusion: Internal Evidence for False Prophethood?From within Islamic sources themselves, an argument can be made that Muhammad failed the Quranic test laid out for authentic prophecy. His death by poison and his personal reference to the cutting of his jugular vein appear to fulfill the Quran’s own stated criteria for divine judgment against a false prophet.Such internal inconsistencies—when weighed alongside the explicit Quranic and Hadith testimonies—support the critical position that Muhammad’s death by poisoning is not merely a historical footnote, but a theological indictment. This analysis invites Muslims and non-Muslims alike to reconsider the prophetic claims of Muhammad in light of Islam’s own sacred texts.ReferencesThe Quran, Surah Al-Haqqah (69:44–47)Sahih Bukhari, Volume 5, Book 59, Number 713Tabaqat Ibn Sa'd, vol. 2, pp. 249–252Guillaume, A.

    "full_content": "Title: A Comparative Analysis of Women’s Empowerment in Israeli and Muslim SocietiesThe status and roles of women in the Middle East differ significantly across national and cultural boundaries. One notable contrast exists between the societal roles of women in Israeli society and those in several predominantly Muslim nations such as Gaza, Syria, and Jordan. These differences can be seen in spheres such as military participation, legal rights, cultural expectations, and religious interpretations.InIsraeli society, women have played an active and visible role in national life, particularly throughcompulsory military service. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) require most Jewish women to serve for at least two years, placing them in roles ranging from combat to intelligence (Lemish & Barzel, 2000). It is not uncommon to see young women in uniform, armed with rifles, even in casual public spaces such as cafés and parks. This image reflects a broader social and legal acceptance of women's autonomy and agency in matters of national security. As one IDF commander once put it, “Our women carry life in one hand and weapons in the other to defend it” (Magen, 2014).By contrast, manyMuslim-majority societiesmaintain more traditional and patriarchal views of gender roles, often influenced by conservative interpretations ofIslamic jurisprudence (fiqh). In such societies, women are frequently encouraged or required to prioritize domestic roles—childbearing, childrearing, and caretaking—while adhering to strict dress codes such as theburqaorniqab(Mernissi, 1991; Cooke, 2001). Though some women embrace these norms as expressions of piety and identity, others view them as restrictions on their personal and civic freedoms.Islamic texts have been interpreted in various ways with regard to gender. For instance,Qur'an 4:34speaks of men as \"protectors and maintainers of women,\" a verse that some traditional scholars interpret as legitimizing male authority and even corporal discipline under certain conditions. This verse, along with hadith literature, has been central in shaping many Islamic legal systems concerning marriage, guardianship, and obedience (Engineer, 2008). However, Islamic feminists and reformist scholars challenge such interpretations, arguing for egalitarian readings that reflect the Qur’an's broader ethical call for justice and compassion (Barlas, 2002).Meanwhile, Israeli women are trained from a young age not only in self-defense but in leadership and technological competence. Many go on to hold prominent positions in government, business, and science (Herzog, 2004). Conversely, in some conservative Muslim settings, girls are still socialized primarily for domestic roles, with limited access to quality education and public decision-making opportunities (UN Women, 2020). This disparity in training and social expectations contributes to a sharp contrast in how empowerment is understood and embodied.Nevertheless, it is essential to acknowledge thediversity of experiences among Muslim women. While restrictive norms exist in some regions, many Muslim-majority countries have made significant progress in promoting women’s education, healthcare access, and political participation. Nations such as Tunisia, Indonesia, and Morocco have implemented progressive reforms, and Muslim women globally have emerged as leaders in academia, activism, and politics (Moghadam, 2004).In summary, the symbolic image of an Israeli woman casually carrying an M16 while enjoying a coffee contrasts sharply with the image of a traditionally dressed Muslim woman engaged in childrearing and domestic duties. This contrast reflects deeper differences in thesocial, legal, and religious frameworksthat shape gender roles in different societies. While the Israeli model emphasizes military readiness and civic equality, certain conservative Islamic frameworks promote modesty and male guardianship as religious virtues. These differences merit careful scholarly analysis rather than simplistic generalizations.ReferencesBarlas, A.

As believers, we rejoice whenever anyone confesses Christ as Lord, whether of high or low intellect, for the gospel is the power of God unto salvation to all who believe (Romans 1:16). However, let us be clear: the divinity of Jesus Christ is not validated by human intelligence, no matter how extraordinary. Truth is not subject to IQ scores; it is grounded in divine revelation.Throughout history, many great minds have embraced the Christian faith—Augustine, Pascal, Newton, and others—not because their intellect proved Christ’s deity, but because the Spirit of God opened their hearts to the truth of the gospel. Similarly, many intellectuals have rejected Christ, for as Scripture declares, “the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him” (1 Corinthians 2:14). The gospel transcends human reasoning; it is spiritually discerned.Mr. Kim’s testimony, while encouraging, should not be treated as evidence of Christ’s divinity, but as a witness to the reality that even the most brilliant minds are not beyond the reach of God’s grace. Jesus is not Lord because the world’s smartest man says so; He is Lord because He rose from the dead (Romans 1:4), fulfilled prophecy (Isaiah 53; Daniel 9), and is exalted at the right hand of the Father (Hebrews 1:3). His deity is a revealed truth, affirmed by Scripture, declared by the apostles, and sealed in the hearts of believers by the Holy Spirit.Let the church not be swayed by celebrity confessions or intellectual endorsements, but by the enduring truth of the Word of God. The confession that “Jesus is Lord” remains a miracle of grace, not a product of intellect. For as Jesus Himself said, “flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in heaven” (Matthew 16:17).—Dr. Maxwell Shimba",

    "full_content": "The Silence of the Garden: A Parable of Withered Innocence and the Ethics of Child Protection in Religious ContextsDr. Maxwell ShimbaUSA Theological University, Orlando, FLAbstractThis article presents and analyzes a parable—The Silence of the Garden—as a theological and ethical allegory confronting child exploitation sanctioned or overlooked within certain religious contexts, particularly in some interpretations of Islamic jurisprudence. Through symbolic language, the narrative critiques the manipulation of sacred texts, the failure of religious guardianship, and the consequences of institutional silence on the innocence of children. The article draws upon theological ethics, child rights frameworks, and reformist Islamic scholarship to advocate for a renewed commitment to justice, particularly the protection of children from harmful traditions rooted in patriarchal and historical legal norms. By reframing religious silence not as consent but as complicity, the article argues that ethical integrity demands an unambiguous denunciation of harmful practices—regardless of religious or cultural origin.1. IntroductionReligious communities across the world hold moral and spiritual authority in high esteem, often entrusting clerics, scholars, and traditions with guidance over social conduct and familial structures. However, when religious authority is invoked to justify the violation of the vulnerable—especially children—it becomes necessary to scrutinize such frameworks with both theological integrity and ethical urgency. The parable“The Silence of the Garden”functions as a literary-theological critique of the ways in which innocence can be sacrificed at the altar of unexamined tradition and unchecked authority.This article engages the parable as a case study in moral theology, drawing attention to the defense of child marriage and other forms of abuse through religious texts. It places particular focus on interpretations within Islamic jurisprudence, while recognizing that such ethical lapses are not exclusive to Islam, but shared across many religious histories. The parable thus becomes a tool for advocacy: a quiet scream for reform in the name of justice, dignity, and divine compassion.2. The Parable as Ethical AllegoryIn the parable, the “garden” represents a moral community, vibrant and full of promise, yet subject to decay not from nature, but from internal betrayal. The “flowers” are children, vulnerable and reliant on caregivers for protection and nourishment. The “guardians” are figures of religious authority, who instead of nurturing, exploit. What begins as metaphor soon reveals itself as a critique of child abuse facilitated or ignored by religious institutions.The silence referenced throughout is not merely the absence of protest—it is symbolic of societal complicity. Parents silencing their children, theologians defending harmful practices, and communities protecting religious reputations over justice all contribute to the withering of the garden. The parable’s power lies in its moral clarity: “Silence is not consent. The Book may not mention every evil, but that does not bless its existence.”3. Scriptural Silence vs. Ethical AccountabilityOne of the parable’s key theological insights is its challenge to the logic that “what is not prohibited is permitted.” This interpretive method, common in some pre-modern jurisprudence, can be used to justify actions not explicitly condemned in sacred texts. But as theologian Linda Hogan argues,“The silence of scripture must not be mistaken for divine approval”(Hogan, 2003, p. 77).In Islam, for instance, debates around the Prophet Muhammad’s marriage to Aisha (reported to have been consummated when she was around nine years old) have led some traditional jurists to allow child marriage under Sharia. Yet modern Islamic scholars such as Dr. Khaled Abou El Fadl and Dr. Kecia Ali argue that such historical acts must be read within their sociocultural context and cannot be transplanted uncritically into contemporary legal and moral frameworks. As Abou El Fadl asserts:“To accept child marriage today as legitimate under Islam is to deny the Qur’anic emphasis on mercy, justice, and dignity”(Abou El Fadl, 2001, p. 245).4. Child Marriage, Islamic Law, and Reformist DiscourseWhile many Islamic legal schools technically allow marriage upon physical signs of puberty—sometimes as early as age nine—there is growing consensus among reformist Muslim scholars and human rights advocates that such permissions conflict with the moral trajectory of the Qur’an and the modern understanding of childhood. Organizations such as Musawah and Sisters in Islam have called for re-evaluation of classical fiqh in light of contemporary knowledge and ethical standards.The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989), ratified by most Muslim-majority countries, defines a child as a person under 18 and explicitly condemns all forms of sexual exploitation and harmful traditional practices, including child marriage (Articles 19, 24, 34). The persistence of such practices in religious communities thus poses not only a theological challenge, but a legal and humanitarian one.5. The Moral Cost of SilenceAs the parable narrates, “Not all flowers bloom again once crushed.” The psychological, emotional, and spiritual trauma experienced by children subjected to early marriage or abuse under religious sanction often results in long-term damage. The silence of religious leaders, parents, and communities—whether born of fear, reverence, or apathy—is a breach of moral responsibility.Christian scripture echoes this warning in the words of Jesus:“If anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea”(Matthew 18:6, NIV). Similarly, the Qur’an places strong emphasis on justice (`adl), protection of the weak (Surah An-Nisa 4:75), and the ethical treatment of orphans and children (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:220).6. Toward a Theology of Protection and JusticeThe time has come for religious communities to move from denial to confession, from complicity to courage. Sacred texts must be interpreted through the lens of divine justice, not archaic patriarchy. Theological ethics demands not only what is permissible, but what is righteous.The prophetic call is not to defend the status quo, but to protect the powerless. In every tradition, the protection of children is a sacred trust. The “garden” can only thrive if the cries of the saplings are heard, honored, and defended.7. ConclusionThe Silence of the Gardenis not just a parable—it is a prophetic mirror held up to religious communities. It exposes the quiet complicity that allows injustice to masquerade as tradition, and calls for an urgent reclamation of theological ethics centered on compassion, justice, and the inviolable dignity of the child.The garden still has hope. But hope begins with truth—and truth begins with breaking the silence.ReferencesAbou El Fadl, K. (2001).Speaking in God’s Name: Islamic Law, Authority and Women. Oneworld Publications.Ali, K.

    "full_content": "Title:The Ethical Crisis of Child Marriage in Religious History: A Critical Examination of the Quranic Tradition in Modern ContextAuthor:Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis paper critically examines the morally and scientifically indefensible practice of child marriage through the lens of Islamic tradition, specifically the Prophet Muhammad’s reported marriage to Aisha at the age of nine. While acknowledging the historical context of 7th-century Arabia, the article evaluates the enduring influence of this precedent in Islamic jurisprudence and its incompatibility with contemporary ethical, psychological, and human rights standards. A comparative reflection is drawn with Judeo-Christian traditions to underscore a broader discourse on prophetic morality, child protection, and the evolution of ethical norms in modern civilization.IntroductionReligious traditions have historically shaped moral paradigms, yet not all ancient practices withstand the scrutiny of contemporary ethical standards. One such contested practice is child marriage, particularly within Islamic tradition where it is recorded that the Prophet Muhammad consummated a marriage with Aisha when she was nine years old (Sahih al-Bukhari, 5133). While this event is often contextualized within 7th-century Arabian norms, its ongoing justification in parts of the Muslim world raises significant ethical concerns in light of modern legal and psychological understanding. This article interrogates this practice from a multidisciplinary standpoint—religious history, psychology, child development, and international human rights—to assess its moral standing today.Historical Context and Islamic JurisprudenceAccording to Sunni canonical hadiths (e.g.,Sahih al-BukhariandSahih Muslim), Aisha was six years old at betrothal and nine at the time of consummation (al-Bukhari, 5133; Muslim, 1422a). Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) traditionally permits marriage upon the onset of puberty, with some schools considering consummation acceptable at or even before this threshold, if permitted by a guardian (wali). Classical scholars like Al-Shafi‘i and Ibn Qudamah accepted this norm, interpreting the Prophet’s conduct as eternally valid.However, this view reflects cultural realities of pre-modern tribal societies that lacked contemporary scientific understanding of childhood, adolescence, or neurodevelopment. In such contexts, survival imperatives and social structures normalized early marriage to secure tribal alliances or progeny. Yet invoking these precedents today to validate child marriage undermines both moral progress and scientific consensus on child welfare.Scientific and Psychological FrameworkModern developmental psychology and neuroscience have drastically altered our understanding of childhood. Studies by the World Health Organization (WHO, 2018) and the American Psychological Association (APA, 2020) confirm that individuals below 18 lack the neurological and emotional maturity required to make informed marital or sexual decisions. The prefrontal cortex, governing moral reasoning and impulse control, remains underdeveloped until approximately age 25 (Steinberg, 2013). Furthermore, early sexual activity correlates with trauma, depression, PTSD, and adverse physical health outcomes, including increased maternal and infant mortality (UNICEF, 2022).Therefore, from a scientific standpoint, child marriage is neither developmentally appropriate nor medically safe. It violates not only individual health but foundational principles of consent and autonomy.Ethical and Legal ConsiderationsFrom an ethical viewpoint, child marriage is a form of structural violence and coercion. Philosophers like Immanuel Kant, who emphasized the inviolable dignity of the human person, would categorically reject such practices. In modern legal frameworks, child marriage constitutes statutory rape, irrespective of cultural or religious justifications. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), ratified by nearly all nations, defines a child as anyone under 18 and urges states to protect children from sexual exploitation and forced marriage (UNCRC, 1989).Moreover, institutions like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International continue to denounce child marriage as a gross human rights violation, especially where religious justifications are used to bypass state laws or international conventions. Thus, any perpetuation of such practice today, whether grounded in religious texts or not, stands in violation of both human rights law and moral reason.Comparative Perspective: Christianity and Prophetic MoralityIn the Judeo-Christian tradition, patriarchs such as Abraham, David, and Solomon engaged in polygamy and maintained concubines. However, contemporary Christian theology does not regard these figures as moral exemplars in the context of marriage or sexual ethics. Rather, their actions are interpreted as descriptive of historical culture, not prescriptive of divine morality. Jesus Christ, who is held as the sinless moral exemplar in Christian theology, neither married nor engaged in polygamy, and His teachings emphasize monogamy, mutual respect, and the protection of the vulnerable (Matthew 19:4–6).Islamic theology, by contrast, treats Muhammad asuswa ḥasana(\"the perfect example\") whose actions are often considered binding. This theological position makes ethical evaluation of his conduct not merely historical but normative. Therefore, if a figure is believed to be divinely guided and morally exemplary, yet engages in behavior that modern consensus deems harmful—such as child marriage—then the legitimacy of that claim must be critically re-evaluated in light of both historical context and contemporary ethics.ConclusionThe enduring veneration of practices like child marriage based on religious precedent poses a profound ethical dilemma in the modern era. While historical context may explain such actions, it does not morally justify their perpetuation today. Religious traditions must be subject to critical scrutiny, especially when their prescriptions conflict with universal principles of human dignity, psychological health, and legal standards of child protection. To uphold the marriage of a minor—such as a 9-year-old—as morally exemplary is to regress from centuries of moral and legal progress. In modern civilization, the standard for moral authority must be anchored not in historical literalism but in an unwavering commitment to human rights and the protection of the most vulnerable.ReferencesAl-Bukhari, M.

Through a comparative exegetical approach, the study highlights how both traditions associate physical covering with shame, honor, and sacredness. It further scrutinizes the paradox in Islam where symbols associated with shame in the biblical context are institutionalized as marks of piety and sanctity, thereby examining the ideological transformation and religious reappropriation of symbols across religious traditions.1. IntroductionThe act of covering—be it of the body or of sacred spaces—has always held a profound place within Abrahamic religious thought. Genesis 38:15 presents a vivid narrative that associates the act of veiling with prostitution and deception, while in Islam, veiling is presented as a symbol of modesty and religious virtue. Simultaneously, the Kaaba, Islam’s most sacred site, is covered in black cloth, inviting comparison with the black veil often worn by Muslim women. This paper investigates the tension between the biblical understanding of covering as an act linked with shame and deception, and the Islamic reinterpretation of the same as an emblem of piety and sanctity.2. Genesis 38:15 – Veiling and ProstitutionGenesis 38:15 states:“When Judah saw her, he thought she was a harlot; because she had covered her face.”(KJV)In this passage, Tamar, Judah's daughter-in-law, disguises herself as a prostitute by veiling herself, prompting Judah to mistake her identity. The text implies a cultural norm in which women who covered themselves—especially in public—could be identified with harlotry, at least under suspicious circumstances. The covering here is a tool ofdeceptionandsexual ambiguity, serving as a visual marker that confounds identity and invites sexual transaction.This narrative reflects an early Near Eastern view that associates facial veiling with specific social roles—particularly harlotry. Thus, covering is not a neutral act but one imbued with societal expectations and moral connotations. The veil hides, protects, or manipulates identity, depending on context, and is not inherently virtuous.3. The Islamic Veil and its Transformation of SymbolismContrary to the implications of Genesis 38:15, Islamic tradition elevates the practice of veiling to a religious command rooted in modesty (haya) and honor. The Quran prescribes covering for believing women in Surah An-Nur (24:31) and Surah Al-Ahzab (33:59), emphasizing that women should draw their garments over themselves to be recognized as respectable and to avoid harassment.The black veil—niqab,hijab, orabaya—serves multiple religious and sociopolitical functions: identity affirmation, communal belonging, religious obedience, and social modesty. The theological inversion is striking: what was once a symbol of shame and sexual deception in Genesis is transformed into a religious obligation and badge of honor in Islam.This transformation is not merely interpretive but ideological. The veil is reappropriated, stripped of its biblical associations with sin and deception, and vested with spiritual purity and obedience. The Islamic veil thus becomes a tool for counter-narrative: reclaiming what once represented disgrace as a form of sanctity and dignity.4. The Kaaba and the Black Cloth: A Sacred CoveringThe Kaaba in Mecca, Islam’s holiest site, is annually draped in a black silk cloth known as theKiswah, inscribed with verses from the Quran in gold thread. This practice is considered an act of veneration, conferring sacredness and majesty upon the structure.From a biblical perspective, the color black and the act of covering are often associated with mourning, concealment, or judgment (cf. Lamentations 4:8; Joel 2:6). In Islamic practice, however, the black cloth becomes an emblem of divine majesty and unity. Again, we witness a symbolic reversal: blackness and covering, which carry connotations of darkness, sin, or disgrace in biblical literature, are invested with honor and sacredness in Islam.The theological irony cannot be overstated. A symbol of human shame and deception in Genesis—black covering—is now used to veil the house of Allah and the bodies of Muslim women alike.5. The Similitude of Shame: Between Biblical Symbolism and Islamic RitualThe covering in Genesis 38:15 was used deceptively and brought about moral scandal. In contrast, Islam institutionalizes the covering of both persons and places as acts of moral uprightness. However, this raises a critical theological and anthropological question: Does Islam merely invert symbols, or does it fundamentally misinterpret the moral universals embedded in earlier scriptures?Islam, while claiming continuity with Judeo-Christian tradition, seems to recontextualize symbols without reconciling their original meanings. The veil, once a tool of prostitution and disguise, is turned into a sign of religious fidelity. The black cloth that may connote sin and obscurity now wraps the most sacred Islamic site.This juxtaposition leads us to ask:Is Islam a continuation, distortion, or contradiction of the Abrahamic tradition it claims to uphold?The covering becomes a simulacrum—an image detached from its original reference—adopted and re-signified.6. Conclusion: Symbolism and Sacred MisappropriationThe theological dissonance between Genesis 38:15 and Islamic covering practices reveals a deeper hermeneutical chasm. The veil, and the black cloth, once associated with concealment and moral ambiguity, are appropriated in Islam as sacred and pure.This paper suggests that Islam does not preserve the original moral symbolism of covering but inverts it, transforming what was shameful into a religious obligation. The simulacrum of sanctity built upon inverted biblical symbols reflects Islam’s broader pattern of theological appropriation—adopting Judeo-Christian imagery while emptying it of its original moral context.As such, thesimilitude of shamein both traditions is not merely symbolic, but evidential of a deeper theological divergence. What the Bible calls deception and shame, Islam calls modesty and sacredness. The question remains: can truth and falsehood be cloaked in the same garment?BibliographyHoly Bible, King James Version.

A Theological and Logical Inquiry into the Finality of ProphethoodBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba | Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractIslamic theology insists that Muhammad is the final prophet, the “Seal of the Prophets” (Khatam an-Nabiyyin). This doctrine is foundational to Islam and is affirmed in the Qur’an in Surah Al-Ahzab 33:40. However, multiple Islamic traditions (Hadith and exegeses) suggest the eschatological return of Isa bin Maryam (Jesus, son of Mary), not merely as a righteous follower but as aruling judge and prophet-like figure, raising profound theological and logical challenges. If Muhammad is the last prophet,what exactly will Isa be upon his return?If Isa still holds a prophetic role,has the Quran contradicted itself by declaring Muhammad as the final prophet?This paper explores the apparent paradox and raises critical academic and theological questions aimed at stimulating scholarly debate within Islamic and interfaith studies.IntroductionThe doctrine of the finality of prophethood is central to Islamic belief. Surah Al-Ahzab 33:40 clearly states:“Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but he is the Messenger of Allah and the Seal of the Prophets (Khatam an-Nabiyyin).”This verse has historically been interpreted by the majority of Muslim scholars to mean thatno prophet will come after Muhammad. Yet, Islamic eschatology—through both Hadith and tafsir literature—asserts thefuture return of Isa bin Maryam (Jesus), who will descend from heaven, defeat the Dajjal (Antichrist), and rule the earth in justice.Thus arises the central contradiction:If Muhammad is the final prophet, what prophetic authority—if any—will Jesus exercise upon his return?Key Quranic and Hadith SourcesQur’an 33:40– Affirms Muhammad as the Seal of Prophets.Qur’an 4:157–159– States that Jesus was not crucified, but was raised up to Allah and will return.Sahih al-Bukhari (Book 55, Hadith 657)– Says that Jesus will descend as a just ruler and break the cross.Sahih Muslim (Book 1, Hadith 293)– \"There is no prophet between me and him [Jesus] and he shall descend.\"This last hadith particularly raises theological tension. If no prophet stands between Muhammad and Jesus, then does Jesus retain his prophetic status after Muhammad? And does his descent notrevive the institution of prophethood after Muhammad’s era, violating the principle of finality?Core Theological Questions and ContradictionsDoes the Quran contradict itself by declaring Muhammad as the last prophet, yet affirming the eschatological return of a former prophet?Is Isa bin Maryam stripped of his prophetic role upon return? If so, where is this clearly stated in the Quran or Hadith? If not, then does his return constitute a prophetic reactivation?Can a prophet return and function as a judge and religious leader without exercising prophethood? If so, how is this different from his previous prophetic mission?If Isa’s return involves religious leadership and issuing judgments in accordance with divine guidance, how does that not constitute prophethood?If Muhammad is the final prophet, how do we interpret Jesus’ return in light of Surah Al-Ahzab 33:40? Is there an exception clause that the Quran or Allah omitted or forgot?Is Isa bin Maryam’s second coming essentially a loophole in the theology of finality? If Allah is omniscient, why make a definitive finality claim knowing Jesus would return?Will Isa receive divine revelation upon return, or act solely based on earlier teachings? If he receives new guidance, is that not revelation, and thus a resumption of prophethood?Islamic Responses and Critical EvaluationIslamic apologistsoften argue that Jesus will not return as a prophet but as afollower of Muhammad, thereby not violating the doctrine of finality. However, this explanation raises its own set of contradictions:If Jesus returns as a follower, does he cease to be a prophet? Can a prophet ever stop being a prophet once ordained by God?If Jesus will lead prayers, judge disputes, and execute divine law, is this not thefunctional essence of a prophet’s role, regardless of formal title?If Isa will break crosses and correct Christian theology, how is that not a new mission—thus new prophethood?This approach appears to diminish the original authority of Isa bin Maryam while simultaneously using him as a divine agent in end-time theology. This inconsistency reflectsa theological patchwork rather than coherent divine planning.A Debate of Divine Logic: Allah’s Oversight or Intentional Contradiction?Let us consider two possibilities:Scenario 1: Allah declared Muhammad as the last prophet, fully aware Isa would return as a prophet.Then Allah intentionally createda contradictionbetween Quran and Hadith, misleading generations of Muslims about the true nature of finality.Scenario 2: Allah forgot or overlooked Isa’s return when revealing Quran 33:40.Then the omniscience of Allah iscalled into question, implying divine forgetfulness or inconsistency.Either scenariodamages the internal consistencyand theological coherence of the Quran.ConclusionThe return of Isa bin Maryam as both a religious judge and a righteous leaderposes serious theological dilemmasfor the Islamic claim that Muhammad is the final prophet. The Qur’an affirms Muhammad’s finality, yet the Hadith affirms Isa’s return—a former prophet returning to act in what appears to be a prophetic capacity. EitherIslam must admit Isa is the final prophetby virtue of his return, or concede that thedoctrine of finality is compromised by exception, leading to divine inconsistency.This contradiction invites further theological scrutiny. If Isa can return and function in prophetic authority,how final was Muhammad's finality?If not a prophet, then what will Isa be—a demoted messenger? A spiritual judge with no divine office?Suggested Areas for Further Research and DebateComparative analysis with Christian eschatology: Does Jesus return in a different office in both religions?Philosophical implications of divine inconsistency.Role of Hadith versus Quran in shaping Islamic doctrine.Analysis of classical tafsir literature on Jesus’ second coming.By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaFounder, Shimba Theological InstituteTheologian, Apologist, Researcher",

The narration claims that Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and his companions consumed the meat of a wild boar during a time of exhaustion and hunger. This paper investigates the hadith’s content, chain of transmission, theological implications, and compatibility with Islamic dietary law (ḥalālandḥarāmdistinctions).IntroductionIslamic jurisprudence (fiqh) draws heavily from two foundational sources: the Qur'an and the Hadith (sayings and actions of Prophet Muhammad). The Qur'an explicitly forbids the consumption of pork (Surah al-Baqarah 2:173, Surah al-Ma'idah 5:3, Surah al-An'am 6:145). Therefore, any narration that claims the Prophet of Islam consumed pork raises significant theological and historical questions.The narration in question is reportedly recorded by Al-Tabar and transmitted via Ibn Ali Bakouri, who attributes it to a statement of ‘Aisha, the wife of the Prophet, regarding an incident in which the Prophet and his companions, after a long journey, allegedly consumed wild boar meat at the house of a woman named Fatimah.The Hadith Text and TranslationArabic Original (As Quoted):والحديث رواه الطبر ، وردَّه ابن علي بكوري ، فسمع أصحاب رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم يقولون: سئم نبي الله وأصحابه من السفر الطويل. وصلوا إلى بيت فاطمة صديقة رفاقها. قال رسول الله: هل عندك ما تأكل؟ أجابت فاطمة بنعم. فسأل رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم إذا كان لك فريسة. فاطمة تجيب عندي خنزير بري. فأكل نبي الله وأصحابه لحم الخنزير البري حتى شبعوا.English Translation:The hadith is narrated by Al-Tabar and received by Ibn Ali Bakouri, who heard the companions of the Prophet of Allah say: The Prophet of Allah and his companions were weary from a long journey. They arrived at the house of Fatimah, a friend of their companions. The Prophet asked, \"Do you have anything to eat?\" Fatimah replied, \"Yes.\" The Prophet asked again, \"Do you have any prey?\" Fatimah answered, \"I have a wild boar.\" Then the Prophet of Allah and his companions ate wild boar meat until they were full.Textual and Source AnalysisUpon preliminary review, several red flags emerge:The Source – Al-Tabar:The reference to “Al-Tabar” is ambiguous. It is unclear whether the author refers to Al-Ṭabarī (the famous 9th-century historian and exegete) or another lesser-known narrator. No such hadith is found in Al-Ṭabarī’sTārīkh al-Rusul wa al-Mulūkor hisTafsīr. The name “Ibn Ali Bakouri” is also absent from any well-known isnād (chain of narration) records among Sunni or Shi'a traditions.Contradiction with Qur'anic Law:The Qur’an forbids the consumption of pork unequivocally (Qur’an 2:173; 5:3; 6:145; 16:115). Even in situations of necessity (darura), the Qur’an allows eating what is forbidden only when there is no alternative and when it is done out of survival, not desire (2:173). However, the tone of the narration here lacks the severity or desperation of such a context.Isnād and Matn Critique:This hadith does not appear in any of the six major hadith collections (Sahih Bukhari, Sahih Muslim, Sunan Abu Dawood, Sunan al-Tirmidhi, Sunan al-Nasa’i, Sunan Ibn Majah), nor does it appear in knownda‘if(weak) compilations. The isnād (chain of narrators) is both obscure and unverifiable, thus failing the criterion ofsahih(authentic) or evenhasan(acceptable).Terminology and Anachronism:The use of the phrase \"wild boar\" (khinzīr barrī) is highly unusual in classical Arabic hadith literature. Moreover, the name “Fatimah,” while common, may imply a conflation with Fatimah al-Zahra (daughter of the Prophet), which further complicates the narrative.Theological and Doctrinal ImplicationsIf accepted as authentic, this narration would directly contradict the Prophet’s teachings and Qur’anic revelation. However, Islamic theology maintains that the Prophet was protected (ma‘sūm) from sin and from violating divine law knowingly. The consumption of pork—wild or domesticated—is strictlyḥarām. To suggest the Prophet did otherwise undermines both his prophetic authority and the integrity of the Qur’anic revelation.ConclusionUpon textual, contextual, and theological scrutiny, this narration must be classified asfabricated (mawdū‘)orinauthentic. It is unsupported by any reliable chain of transmission and stands in stark contradiction to foundational Islamic teachings. It may represent a later polemical insertion or a forgery designed to provoke controversy.Scholars and students of comparative religion must approach such claims with academic rigor and a critical eye toward historical methodology, isnād science, and theological coherence.ReferencesThe Qur'an: Surah al-Baqarah 2:173, Surah al-Ma'idah 5:3, Surah al-An'am 6:145, Surah al-Nahl 16:115Al-Ṭabarī,Tārīkh al-Rusul wa al-Mulūk, ed.

    "full_content": "Was Muhammad Really Illiterate? A Critical Examination of the Traditional Islamic ClaimBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteAbstractOne of the most widely asserted claims in Islamic theology is that Prophet Muhammad was illiterate, and that this illiteracy serves as proof of the divine origin of the Qur’an. This paper critically evaluates the historical, linguistic, and hadith-based evidence surrounding this claim. It also questions the theological implications of asserting Muhammad’s illiteracy as a miracle, demonstrating that both the premise and the conclusion are flawed. Further analysis is provided on the interpretation of the Arabic termummiyy(ٱلْأُمِّيّ) and its contextual meaning, including a re-examination of hadiths that suggest Muhammad was capable of reading and writing.1. IntroductionMuslims commonly argue that the illiteracy (ummiyy) of Prophet Muhammad is miraculous, positing that the literary excellence of the Qur’an could not have originated from an unlettered man. This reasoning, however, presumes two unverified claims: first, that Muhammad was indeed illiterate in the strict sense of being unable to read or write; and second, that the Qur’an was revealed in a purely oral form without any textual interaction by Muhammad. This paper questions both claims.2. The Traditional Understanding of 'Ummiyy' (ٱلْأُمِّيّ)In Islamic theology, Surah 7:157 refers to Muhammad asal-nabiyy al-ummiyy(ٱلنَّبِيُّ ٱلْأُمِّيُّ), usually translated as \"the unlettered Prophet.\" However, the Arabic termummiyydoes not unambiguously mean “illiterate.” According toEdward William LaneinAn Arabic-English Lexicon(1863, p. 92),ummiyycan also mean\"gentile\", especially when contrasted with Jewish or scriptural communities. This is supported by Surah 62:2, which describes Muhammad as being sent “to theummiyyīn,” often interpreted as “to the gentiles.”“It is He who has sent among the unlettered [ummiyyīn] a Messenger from themselves…”(Qur’an 62:2, Sahih International).Thus, a textual-linguistic analysis suggests thatummiyymay refer to Muhammad’s lack of scriptural background (non-Jewish), rather than a lack of literacy. The conflation ofummiyywith “illiterate” lacks strong philological support.3. Hadith Evidence Questioning Illiteracy3.1 Treaty of Hudaybiyyah (Sahih al-Bukhari 2699)One of the strongest arguments against Muhammad’s illiteracy arises during the drafting of the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah. The hadith inSahih al-Bukhari(2699) records that the Prophet instructedAli to strike out the phrase *“Messenger of Allah”* after the Quraysh objected. WhenAli refused, Muhammad is said to have taken the treaty and made the change himself:“So Allah's Messenger took the document and wrote…”(Sahih al-Bukhari, 2699)This moment contradicts the belief that Muhammad could neither read nor write. If he personally modified a treaty document, that indicates at least rudimentary literacy.3.2 Final Illness and Request for Writing Tools (Sahih al-Bukhari 114; Sahih Muslim 1637a)During Muhammad’s final illness, he is reported to have requested writing materials to leave a directive for his followers:“Bring me a pen and paper so I may write for you a statement after which you will not go astray.”(Sahih al-Bukhari, 114;Sahih Muslim, 1637a)Although the Prophet’s request was interrupted and unfulfilled, the hadith strongly suggests his intent to write personally, undermining the assumption that he was incapable of writing.4. Theological Implications and Logical FallacyMuslim apologists often argue that the Qur'an's existence as a literary work authored by an illiterate man is evidence of divine origin. However, this reasoning is circular and self-defeating:First, it presupposes illiteracy as fact.Second, it assumes that human literacy or illiteracy limits divine inspiration.Third, it ignores the Qur'an’s posthumous compilation by literate scribes like Zayd ibn Thabit and others under Caliphs Abu Bakr and Uthman.If Muhammad merely received and orally transmitted divine revelation, then his literacy status becomes irrelevant to the Qur’an’s composition. Furthermore, reliance on a claim of illiteracy to validate divine origin ignores better theological criteria, such as truthfulness, historical accuracy, and moral coherence.5. ConclusionThe claim that Muhammad was illiterate is not conclusively supported by linguistic analysis or early Islamic sources. The use ofummiyyin the Qur’an likely refers to non-Jewish background rather than illiteracy. Additionally, key hadiths suggest Muhammad could read and write. Therefore, Muhammad’s supposed illiteracy should not be considered evidence for the divine origin of the Qur’an.ReferencesLane, Edward William.An Arabic-English Lexicon.

    "full_content": "WERE THESE EXTRAORDINARY TRAITS OF MUHAMMAD PROPHETIC?By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionMany Muslims uphold Muhammad as the final and most exemplary prophet of God, whose character and actions reflect divine revelation. However, a critical and historical analysis of Islamic texts reveals a troubling picture. This paper investigates whether certain controversial traits and actions attributed to Muhammad align with the qualities expected of a true prophet of God. The findings are drawn directly from canonical Islamic sources and contrasted with Christian theological perspectives.1.Muhammad’s Involvement in Adultery with a Slave GirlAccording toTafsir Ibn Kathir(Vol. 6, p. 367), Muhammad was found by his wife Hafsa engaging in intimate relations with her Coptic maidservant, Mariyah. Hafsa reportedly rebuked him harshly. In response, Muhammad promised not to engage with the slave girl again.Question:Is it consistent with prophetic character to be caught in such a scandal within one’s household?2.Muhammad and Prostitution AllegationsSunan Abu Dawud, Book 38, Hadith 4458, narrates that Muhammad sent Ali to punish a male companion who had sexual relations with a female slave owned by Muhammad without his permission. Ali found the girl bleeding, indicating recent intercourse. Muhammad instructed that she not be punished until she healed.Observation:The very ownership of sex slaves and managing their sexual engagements calls into question the prophetic integrity as understood in biblical standards.3.Muhammad and Alleged Homosexual BehaviorInHadith 16,245, narrated by Muawiya ibn Abu Sufyan, it is claimed that Muhammad sucked on the tongue and kissed the lips of his grandson Al-Hassan. This was followed by the assertion that whoever Muhammad did this to would not be punished in hellfire. Similar narrations claim he did so to Ali during illness.Critical Reflection:Such intimate acts, especially justified with spiritual reward, raise moral and theological concerns regarding the nature of prophetic purity and propriety.4.Muhammad and Alcohol ConsumptionInSahih Muslim3753, it is reported that Muhammad asked for and drank strong wine, which led to intoxication.Query:How could a prophet, whose followers are later forbidden alcohol, justify being intoxicated himself? Is this reflective of divine conduct?5.Muhammad’s Affliction with Magic and SorcerySahih Bukhari, Vol. 4, Book 54, Hadith 490 and Vol. 7, Book 71, Hadith 658, report that Muhammad was bewitched to the point of delusion. Tafsir by Sheikh Abdullah Saleh Al-Farsy (pp. 977–978) also recounts this incident.Theological Dilemma:If sorcery is condemned as kufr (disbelief), how could God allow His prophet to be overpowered by it? Was the magic from Allah or from outside forces? What prophet in biblical history was ever bewitched in such a manner?6.Muhammad's Uncertainty About His Eternal FateInQur’an 46:9, Muhammad is quoted as saying:“Say: I am not something original among the messengers, and I do not know what will be done with me or with you. I only follow that which is revealed to me.”Implication:A prophet of God uncertain about his salvation and that of his followers stands in sharp contrast to Jesus Christ, who declared with authority:“I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” (John 14:6)7.Satan Allegedly Converts to IslamAccording to a claim inThe Origin of Jinn(p. 20), Muhammad is reported to have converted Satan to Islam.Theological Question:How can the sworn enemy of God—Satan—be considered a Muslim? If this is true, then Islam becomes the only religion where Satan is accepted as a believer.Final ReflectionsThese accounts raise serious theological and moral concerns about the legitimacy of Muhammad’s prophethood. According to both biblical standards and general moral reasoning, the life and character of a prophet should reflect holiness, consistency, and moral clarity. In contrast, Muhammad’s biography—according to Islamic sources—shows inconsistencies, moral failures, and spiritual confusion.Key Theological Questions for Muslims:(a) If sorcery is a form of disbelief, what is the connection between Allah and magic if He allowed His prophet to be bewitched?(b) Were the witches who bewitched Muhammad Muslims or pagans?(c) Was the magic inflicted on Muhammad sanctioned by Allah or from an opposing force?(d) Which other prophet in religious history was ever bewitched and deluded?(e) Which prophet was unsure of his own salvation and the fate of his followers?Conclusion: Why Follow a Prophet With Demonic Traits?Considering the above, one must ask:Why abandon Jesus Christ—the Way, the Truth, and the Life—for a prophet whose own conduct and confessions contradict divine holiness and certainty?“...while we wait for the blessed hope—the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ.” (Titus 2:13)Come to Jesus, the Living Savior and the True God.Blessings to you all.Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

A Theological and Historical AnalysisAuthor:Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Servant of Jesus Christ, the Great God (Titus 2:13)Shimba Theological Institute, New York, NYAbstractSome Islamic apologists claim that Muhammad was prophesied in the New Testament, specifically in the Gospel of John (chapters 14–16), as the \"Helper\" or \"Comforter\" (Greek:Paraklētos), also known as the Holy Spirit. This article critically examines these claims by analyzing the biblical text and historical Christian interpretation. It demonstrates that such assertions are inconsistent both with the internal biblical evidence and with traditional Islamic theology.IntroductionA recurring claim among some Islamic scholars and da’wah proponents is that theParaklētos—translated as \"Helper\" or \"Comforter\" in the Gospel of John—refers to the prophet Muhammad. This interpretation, however, diverges from both Christian theological understanding and the internal coherence of the Gospel narrative. The relevant passages in question are John 14:16–26, 15:26, and 16:5–15.This paper provides a theological rebuttal to such claims and outlines why theParaklētosmust be identified as the Holy Spirit, not Muhammad, as understood consistently throughout Christian history.Scriptural Analysis: Gospel of John 14–16The relevant passages read:John 14:26– “But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, He will teach you all things...”John 15:26– “When the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father—the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father—He will bear witness about me.”John 16:13–14– “When the Spirit of truth comes... He will glorify me, for He will take what is mine and declare it to you.”Inconsistencies with the Islamic InterpretationIf these passages were truly about Muhammad, then logically Muslims would need to affirm the following five propositions:Muhammad glorified JesusJohn 16:14: “He will glorify me.”Yet, in Islam, Jesus is considered a prophet subordinate to Muhammad, not glorified above him.Muhammad was sent by God in Jesus’ nameJohn 14:26: “...whom the Father will send in my name.”No Islamic teaching affirms that Muhammad was sent in Jesus' name.Muhammad was sent by JesusJohn 16:7: “...for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you.”Islam does not teach that Muhammad was sent by Jesus, which would imply Jesus’ divine authority over Muhammad.Muhammad took from Jesus’ knowledge and made it knownJohn 16:15: “All that the Father has is mine; therefore I said that He will take what is mine and declare it to you.”Islam does not claim that Muhammad relied on the teachings or revelation of Jesus for his message.Muhammad dwelt within the disciplesJohn 14:17: “...He dwells with you and will be in you.”Muhammad, a human prophet, did not spiritually indwell anyone, whereas the Holy Spirit is described as indwelling believers.Thus, for the Islamic interpretation to be valid, Muslims would have to accept a Christology and pneumatology inconsistent with Islamic doctrine.Historical TestimonyBefore the Council of Nicaea (325 A.D.), early Church Fathers had already identified theParaklētosas the Holy Spirit. For instance,Archelaus of Mesopotamia(c. 262–278 A.D.) in hisDisputation with Manes(ch. 34–35, pp. 208–209) clearly refers to the Helper as the Holy Spirit.This interpretation predates Islam by centuries and shows no evidence that Christians understood this prophecy to refer to a future human prophet.Scholarly ReferencesGeisler, Norman L., and Ron Rhodes.When Cultists Ask: A Popular Handbook on Cultic Misinterpretations.Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Books, 1997, pp. 182–183.Geisler, Norman L., and Thomas Howe.When Critics Ask: A Popular Handbook on Bible Difficulties.Wheaton, IL: Victor Books, 1992, pp. 419–420.Archelaus.The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes, inAnte-Nicene Fathers, vol. 6. Edited by Alexander Roberts and James Donaldson.ConclusionThe claim that Muhammad is theParaklētosof John 14–16 is theologically untenable and historically unsupported. The internal logic of the Gospel of John, the consistent witness of early Christian writers, and the contradictions with Islamic doctrine all point to the identification of theHelperas the Holy Spirit, not a future prophet. Consequently, any serious theological reflection must reject the Muslim reinterpretation as an anachronistic and doctrinally flawed imposition on the New Testament text.Shalom,Dr. Maxwell ShimbaServant of Jesus Christ, Our Great God and Savior (Titus 2:13)Shimba Theological InstituteNew York, NY",

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThe Qur’an claims to be a divine revelation wholly free of internal contradictions. Surah 4:82 asserts that a divine scripture must be without discrepancy, and Islamic commentators have historically reinforced this view. However, a closer textual analysis reveals problematic inconsistencies—most notably in the Qur’an’s designation of multiple individuals as the \"first Muslim.\" This paper will examine the claim of internal consistency in the Qur’an through theological, textual, and logical lenses, presenting a critical analysis of whether such contradictions undermine the Qur’an’s divine origin.IntroductionOne of the foundational claims of Islamic theology is the Qur’an’scomplete internal coherenceand divine authorship. The Qur’an states:Surah 4:82“Do they not consider the Qur’an (with care)? Had it been from other than Allah, they would surely have found therein much discrepancy.”This verse has been widely interpreted by classical and modern Islamic scholars as a definitive proof of the Qur’an’s inerrancy.Tafsir Ibn Kathircomments that the Qur’an contains no inconsistencies or contradictions because it is a revelation from \"the Most-Wise, Worthy of all praise.\" Similarly,Yusuf Aliinterprets the verse to affirm the Qur’an’s divine authorship on the basis of its coherence across time, subjects, and contexts.The Islamic Claim of Qur'anic ConsistencyThe assertion of coherence is central to Islamic apologetics. Yusuf Ali, in his commentary, claims:“The Qur’an claims to be a revelation from Allah, and the challenge is that if it were from any other source, it would contain many inconsistencies and contradictions, which no one can deny in any human composition. But in the Qur’an, no such inconsistencies exist.”This argument implies that even a single contradiction within the Qur’anic text would serve as evidence against its divine origin.A Case Study: Who Was the First Muslim?An instructive example of apparent inconsistency lies in the Qur’an’sidentification of the \"first Muslim\", a title that seems to be attributed to multiple individuals:1.Muhammad as the First MuslimSurah 39:12–“And I (Muhammad) am commanded to be the first of those who bow to Allah in Islam.”Surah 6:163–“No partner hath He: this am I commanded, and I am the first of those who bow to His will.”2.Moses as the First BelieverSurah 7:143–“When Moses recovered, he said: ‘Glory be to Thee! To Thee I turn in repentance, and I am the first to believe.’”3.Abraham as the First MuslimSurah 2:132–“And this was the legacy that Abraham left to his sons, and so did Jacob; ‘Oh my sons! Allah hath chosen the Faith for you; then die not except in the Faith of Islam.’”This raises a fundamental contradiction:How can three distinct individuals, living centuries apart, all be described as the \"first Muslim\"?Theological ImplicationsFrom a theological standpoint, this contradiction is not merely semantic. The Qur’an is assertingpriority in faith and submissionto God—a foundational identity marker in Islam. The termMuslim(one who submits to Allah) is used retroactively for pre-Islamic prophets, yet simultaneously, Muhammad is declared thefirstto submit.Islamic scholars have attempted to resolve this by suggesting that each figure was the “first Muslim”in their own time, but this interpretation is not textually grounded in the Qur’an itself. The Qur’an does not qualify these statements with temporal clauses. Each verse makesan absolute claim.Logical and Hermeneutical ConcernsFrom a hermeneutical perspective, the claim of \"firstness\" in multiple contexts without clarification leads tological incoherence. If the Qur’an was revealed by an all-wise, all-knowing deity, such semantic confusion should not exist, especially in a book whose clarity is constantly emphasized (Surah 12:1; 16:89).Moreover, this inconsistency directly challenges the claim of Surah 4:82. Ifeven onecontradiction exists in the Qur’anic narrative, then—by the Qur’an’s own standard—it wouldnotbe from Allah.ConclusionThe assertion that Muhammad, Moses, and Abraham were each the \"first Muslim\" presents atextual contradictionin the Qur’an. According to Surah 4:82, the presence of contradiction indicates that the text cannot be from God. Thus, this specific inconsistency undermines the Qur’an’s claim of divine authorship and perfect consistency.While Muslims maintain that the Qur’an is a flawless and inerrant revelation, critical textual analysis—when conducted with intellectual honesty and academic rigor—reveals that this claim does not withstand scrutiny. Further study is needed to assess whether these inconsistencies are isolated anomalies or indicative of broader textual and theological fragmentation.Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteOrlando, Florida",

This article examines one such contradiction—whether the Qur’an was revealed all at once or gradually over time—and evaluates its implications for the doctrine of inerrancy.Introduction: The Qur’an’s Test of ConsistencyIslamic theology maintains that the Qur’an's lack of contradiction is proof of its divine origin. The Qur’an declares:Surah 4:82“Do they not consider the Qur’an (with care)? Had it been from other than Allah, they would surely have found therein much discrepancy.”This verse serves as an internal test for divine authorship. Islamic scholars, both classical and contemporary, have emphasized the Qur’an’s uniformity as a hallmark of its authenticity. However, any observable contradiction would, by this criterion, undermine the Qur’an’s claim of being the literal Word of God.The Discrepancy in the Revelation TimelineA critical inconsistency arises concerninghow and when the Qur’an was revealed. The Qur’an appears to assertboththat it was revealed all at onceon a specific night, and that it was revealedgradually over time.1. Revelation in a Single Night – The “Night of Power”The Qur’an repeatedly emphasizes that the entire revelation occurred on a specific, blessed night:Surah 97:1–“Indeed, We sent it [the Qur’an] down during the Night of Decree.”Surah 44:3–“Indeed, We sent it down during a blessed night. Indeed, We were to warn [mankind].”These verses clearly indicate acomplete revelationon a specific night, understood by Muslim tradition asLaylat al-Qadr(the Night of Power) during Ramadan.2. Gradual Revelation Over TimeIn contrast, other passages affirm that the Qur’an wasrevealed in stages, spanning years:Surah 17:106–“(It is) a Qur’an which We have divided (into parts), that you might recite it to the people over time. And We have sent it down progressively.”This verse, among others, affirms that the Qur’an was revealedpiecemeal, in direct response to situations during Muhammad’s prophetic ministry over 23 years.Theological and Hermeneutical TensionThis presents atextual contradiction. Was the Qur’an revealedin a single night, as Surahs 97 and 44 explicitly state? Or was it revealedgradually over decades, as Surah 17:106 and Islamic historiography attest?Muslim commentators often attempt to reconcile this by suggesting that the Qur’an waspre-revealedin its entirety to the “Preserved Tablet” (al-Lawh al-Mahfuz) or to the “lowest heaven” on the Night of Power, and then revealed in portions to Muhammad over time. However, this interpretation isextra-Qur’anic—it relies on later theological developments, not on the Qur’anic text itself. The Qur’andoes not mentionthis two-step process.From a hermeneutical standpoint, this introducesambiguityand undermines the Qur’an’s repeated claim to beclear and detailed(Arabic:mubīn, see Surah 12:1; 16:89).Contradiction in Light of Surah 4:82Returning to the Qur’an’s own standard:“Had it been from other than Allah, they would have found in it much discrepancy.”(Surah 4:82)The above contradiction—concerning the method and timeline of revelation—is not semantic or metaphorical. It is adirect conflictbetween two claims, both assertinghowthe Qur’an was delivered to humanity. Such a contradiction challenges the Qur’an’sinternal test of divine origin.ConclusionThis analysis has highlighted a fundamental inconsistency in the Qur’an’s account of its own revelation: whether it was sent down in one night or revealed gradually over time. This is not a trivial matter of interpretation but strikes at the very foundation of the Qur’anic claim to divine origin and consistency.If the Qur’an sets its own standard for authenticity—complete internal consistency—then this contradiction must be addressed. According to Surah 4:82, such a discrepancy would be evidence that the Qur’an isnotfrom Allah. As such, this inconsistency provides a serious theological and textual challenge to the doctrine of Qur’anic inerrancy.Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteNew York, NY",

Had it been from other than Allah, they would surely have found therein much discrepancy.\"— Surah 4:82This verse presents a challenge to the reader: examine the Qur’an, and if contradictions are found, its divine origin is invalidated. Classical Islamic scholars have reiterated this as an apologetic stance affirming the Qur’an’s perfection.Forgiveness of Sins: A Theological Inconsistency?The specific issue under scrutiny in this analysis concerns the Qur’an’s statements regarding divine forgiveness. Does Allah forgive all sins without exception, or are there sins He categorically does not forgive?Affirmation: Allah Forgives All SinsOne passage strongly emphasizes universal forgiveness:\"Say, O My servants who have transgressed against themselves [by sinning], do not despair of the mercy of Allah. Indeed, Allah forgives all sins. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful.\"— Surah 39:53This verse has been frequently quoted to promote the Qur’anic message of hope and mercy. The language here is inclusive:“Allah forgives all sins.”It presents divine forgiveness as comprehensive and unconditional for the repentant.Limitation: Allah Does Not Forgive Shirk (Associating Partners with Him)In contrast, other passages limit this forgiveness:\"Indeed, Allah does not forgive association with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills. And he who associates others with Allah has certainly gone far astray.\"— Surah 4:116\"Allah forgiveth not that partners should be set up with Him; but He forgiveth anything else, to whom He pleaseth...\"— Surah 4:48These verses explicitly state an exception:Shirk(polytheism or associating others with Allah) is unforgivable unless the person repents before death. The implication is clear — while many sins can be forgiven,shirkis treated as categorically different and, in the absence of sincere repentance, is unforgivable.A Theological TensionThis leads to a theological tension. Surah 39:53 appears to affirm thatall sinscan be forgiven without exception. However, Surahs 4:48 and 4:116 introduce an exception that directly contradicts the former’s absoluteness.Muslim apologists and exegetes (e.g., Al-Tabari, Al-Qurtubi, Ibn Kathir) have attempted to resolve this issue by interpreting Surah 39:53 as applying only to sins committed beforeshirkor only to those who repent prior to death. However, the phrase “Allah forgives all sins” in 39:53 is unqualified, making the restriction introduced later appear inconsistent unless read with heavy interpretive framing.ConclusionThe juxtaposition of these verses introduces a genuine interpretative difficulty for the doctrine of divine forgiveness in the Qur’an. If the Qur’an claims that it contains no contradiction (Surah 4:82), then the universal declaration of forgiveness in 39:53 appears incompatible with the conditional exclusion found in 4:48 and 4:116.Whether this constitutes a theological inconsistency or a nuance in divine justice remains a matter of perspective. From an academic standpoint, however, this serves as a legitimate example of internal tension within the Qur’anic text, calling into question its claim of absolute consistency.",

This belief is not merely a theological position but one embedded in the Qur’an itself:Surah 4:82–“Do they not then reflect on the Qur'an? Had it been from other than Allah, they would have found therein much contradiction.”(Yusuf Ali)This claim forms a central pillar of the Qur'an’s argument for divine authorship. According to this verse, any meaningful contradiction within the text itself would undermine the assertion that the Qur'an originates from God. In this segment of our ongoing series, we turn our attention to descriptions of the food in Hell (Jahannam) to examine whether multiple and differing portrayals present a case of internal contradiction.Subject of Investigation: The Nature of Food in HellThe Qur'an offers vivid imagery of the torments awaiting those consigned to Hell, including descriptions of the sustenance provided therein. However, these descriptions are varied and, arguably, conflicting.1. Bitter Thorny Plant (Dhaari‘)Surah 88:6–“No food will there be for them but a bitter Dhari’.”The term “Dhari’” has been interpreted by classical commentators (e.g., Ibn Kathir, Al-Jalalayn) as referring to a thorny desert plant—dry, bitter, and inedible. Some exegeses interpret it as the poisonous plant known as al-Shubruq.2. Corrupted Pus from WoundsSurah 69:36–“Nor hath he any food except the corruption from the washing of wounds.”This disturbing description—variously translated as \"filthy pus\" or \"discharges from wounds\"—represents an entirely different and grotesque kind of sustenance.Surah 69:31(contextual background):“Burn him in the blazing Fire.”This precedes the mention of the pus, suggesting that punishment includes more than fire—there is also detestable nourishment.3. Devilish Fruit from the Tree of ZaqqumSurah 37:64–66–“For it is a tree that springs out of the bottom of Hellfire: The shoots of its fruit-stalks are like the heads of devils: Truly they will eat thereof and fill their bellies therewith.”Here, the food of Hell is said to come from the tree ofZaqqum, a recurrent symbol in Islamic eschatology. Its fruit is described in demonic imagery, emphasizing spiritual as well as physical torment.Analysis of the DiscrepancyThe central issue lies in the Quran presenting multiple, seemingly exclusive descriptions of the only food available in Hell. IfSurah 88:6declares that “no food will there be except bitter thorny plants,” how canSurah 69:36claim instead that the food consists ofpus? Moreover, how does the tree ofZaqquminSurah 37integrate with these accounts?There are three interpretive options, each with theological implications:Literal Exclusivity: If taken literally and exclusively, these verses cannot all simultaneously be true unless different groups in Hell receive different forms of torment. However, this explanation is not present in the Qur'anic text itself and thus requires extrapolation not explicitly supported.Metaphorical Reading: Some commentators propose metaphorical interpretation—Dhari’,Zaqqum, andpusall symbolize intense suffering rather than being literal foods. While plausible, this undermines the vividness and specificity of the descriptions, which are otherwise presented in concrete terms.Cumulative Punishment: Another apologetic attempt suggests acumulativemodel—each description represents one facet of Hell’s torment, applied variously to different sinners. However, this again assumes something not stated in the texts that use exclusivist phrasing such as“no food except…”Theological ImplicationsIf the Qur’an claims, per Surah 4:82, that divine authorship implies absence of contradiction, and yet it exhibits conflicting descriptions of the same eschatological reality, one must ask whether these contradictions are reconcilable without significant eisegesis (reading into the text).While one might argue that literary or thematic diversity does not amount to contradiction, the specificity and exclusivity of the language in these verses suggest more than poetic variety. The claim of“no food except…”logically negates alternatives unless multiple groups are being described—something the Qur'an itself does not clarify in these contexts.ConclusionWhile the type of food in Hell may seem doctrinally minor, the implications are weighty. If the Qur’an presents mutually exclusive descriptions of the same phenomenon without qualification, and if it states that such contradictions would prove the text is not divine, then this becomes a theological and philosophical problem.Final Assessment: The varying depictions of Hell’s food in Surahs 88:6, 69:36, and 37:64–66 constitute atextual inconsistencyunless heavily reinterpreted. According toSurah 4:82, this opens the Qur'an to legitimate critical scrutiny regarding its claim of divine origin.Prepared by:Dr. Maxwell ShimbaSenior Fellow in Comparative ScriptureShimba Theological Institute, New York, NY",

This claim is derived from verses such as Surah 4:82, which challenges readers to identify discrepancies as a test of divine authorship. However, a critical literary and theological analysis of the Quran’s eschatological descriptions—particularly regarding the food of Hell—raises important questions concerning internal coherence. This article investigates the multiplicity of descriptions concerning Hell's sustenance in the Quran and assesses whether such variances constitute theological contradictions or can be explained as thematic diversity. The findings contribute to the broader discourse on the Quran’s divine claim of inerrancy and consistency.1. IntroductionThe Quran explicitly states in Surah 4:82:“Do they not reflect upon the Qur'an? If it had been from other than Allah, they would have found within it much contradiction.”(Quran 4:82, Sahih International)This verse has been pivotal in Islamic apologetics, serving as a self-verifying test of divine origin. Muslim scholars have historically contended that the absence of contradiction in the Quran is evidence of its perfection and divine authorship (Al-Tabari,Tafsir al-Tabari; Al-Qurtubi,Al-Jami’ li Ahkam al-Qur’an).Nonetheless, when examining the Quran's descriptions of Hell and its inhabitants' conditions, apparent inconsistencies arise—particularly regarding the sustenance of the damned. This article focuses on these inconsistencies to determine whether they breach the Quran’s self-imposed test of inerrancy.2. Descriptions of Food in Hell: A Textual AnalysisThree primary passages describe what the inhabitants of Hell will consume:2.1 Bitter Thorny Plant –Dhaari’Surah 88:6:“No food will there be for them but a bitter dari’.”The term “dari’” refers to a thorny desert plant, commonly identified withAl-Shubrum, which is both inedible and harmful (Ibn Kathir,Tafsir al-Qur'an al-Azim).2.2 Pus from Wounds –GhislinSurah 69:36:“Nor hath he any food except the corruption from the washing of wounds.”The wordghislinis interpreted by many exegetes (e.g., Al-Jalalayn) as a fluid composed of bodily excretions or pus, indicating extreme degradation.2.3 Fruit of the Tree of ZaqqumSurah 37:64–66:“For it is a tree that springs out of the bottom of Hellfire. The shoots of its fruit-stalks are like the heads of devils. Truly they will eat thereof and fill their bellies therewith.”The tree of Zaqqum, often interpreted as a symbol of spiritual and physical corruption, offers a grotesque image of nourishment (Al-Qurtubi,Tafsir, vol. 15).3. Theological and Logical ImplicationsFrom a purely theological standpoint, each of these descriptions could be interpreted metaphorically to signify various stages or types of punishment. However, the language employed is not explicitly metaphorical. Instead, it describes the physical act of eating, suggesting literal experiences in the afterlife.3.1 Contradiction or Multiplicity?Islamic apologists often argue that these are not contradictions but complementary descriptions (Al-Razi,Mafatih al-Ghayb). Yet, the Quranic text offers these descriptions in the context of exclusivity:“No foodwill there be for thembuta bitter thorny plant” (88:6)“Norhath he any foodexceptcorruption from wounds” (69:36)The Arabic terms“illa”(except) and“laisa lahu ta’am illa”(he has no food except) emphasize exclusivity and mutual exclusion. This raises a hermeneutical dilemma: how can multiple exclusive foods coexist in a logically coherent description of eschatological reality?3.2 The Failure of the Quran’s Internal Test?Given that Surah 4:82 offers a self-imposed falsifiability test—i.e., the presence of any contradiction would negate its divine origin—the co-existence of mutually exclusive descriptions challenges the claim of perfect consistency. Scholars such as W.M. Watt (1961) and John Wansbrough (1977) have long noted that literary tension and chronological layering within the Quran may reflect evolving redaction rather than singular authorship.4. Comparative Perspective and Scriptural ConsistencyIn contrast, biblical eschatology—though also diverse in metaphor—maintains internal coherence without using absolute exclusive terminology. For instance, descriptions of \"weeping and gnashing of teeth\" or \"lake of fire\" (Matthew 13:42, Revelation 20:14) differ in imagery but are unified in tone and purpose without suggesting mutually exclusive realities.5. ConclusionThe Quran’s descriptions of Hell's sustenance, when examined through the lens of exclusivity and internal coherence, raise significant theological questions. The presence of multiple, mutually exclusive food types—each presented as the only food available—presents a serious challenge to the claim found in Surah 4:82. While theological flexibility and metaphorical readings may offer partial explanations, the linguistic and logical exclusivity embedded in the verses limits interpretive maneuverability.Thus, this case study illustrates how a close, scholarly critique of internal Quranic content may contest the assertion of absolute consistency and divine authorship. It invites further interfaith, philosophical, and textual dialogue regarding the Quran’s nature and origin.ReferencesAl-Tabari,Jāmiʿ al-Bayān ʿan Ta’wīl Āy al-Qur’ān.

It clearly identifies theComforter (Greek:Paraklētos)as theHoly Spirit, who is sent byJesus from the Fatherand whose role is to testify of Jesus. The broader context of John 14–16 affirms that the Comforter is the Spirit of Truth who will dwellinthe disciples (John 14:17), teach them all things (John 14:26), and glorify Jesus (John 16:14).Evaluating the Islamic Claim That Muhammad is the ComforterSome Islamic apologists argue that theParaklētos(Comforter) refers toMuhammad. However, when examined critically, both biblically and historically, this interpretation collapses under scrutiny:Was Muhammad given to the disciples?No. Muhammad was born approximately six centuries after Jesus’ ascension. He was not present in the time of the disciples, nor was he received by them, as the Holy Spirit was on the Day of Pentecost (Acts 2:1–4).Was Muhammad living at the time of the disciples?No. Muhammad lived in the 6th and 7th centuries AD (c. 570–632 AD), whereas the disciples of Jesus lived and ministered in the 1st century.Was Muhammad living inside the disciples?This is an impossibility both biologically and theologically. The Gospel of John 14:17 says of the Comforter, “He dwelleth with you and shall bein you.” No human prophet, including Muhammad, can indwell believers. Only the Holy Spirit, a divine person, has that capacity.Was Muhammad omnipresent?No. Omnipresence is an attribute of deity, not of created beings. Muhammad, as a human prophet in Islam, was not omnipresent. The Holy Spirit, however, is described as present in all believers simultaneously (cf. Romans 8:9–11).Is Muhammad inside Christians?Again, this contradicts both Christian theology and Islamic teaching. Christians believe the indwelling of the Holy Spirit is essential to the new birth (John 3:5; Romans 8:9). Muhammad is not believed by Muslims to indwell anyone.Did Muhammad teach about Jesus?Muhammad acknowledged Jesus in the Qur’an as a prophet and messenger butexplicitly deniedkey aspects of Jesus' identity, such as His divinity (Qur’an 5:72), crucifixion (Qur’an 4:157), and Sonship (Qur’an 19:35). This is fundamentally incompatible with the Comforter's mission, which is to glorify and testify of Christ (John 16:14).Was Muhammad a spirit?No. Muhammad was a man, not a spirit. The Comforter is called theSpirit of truth(John 14:17). Islam never claims Muhammad was a spirit or divine presence.Was Muhammad from the Father?The Comforter is said to \"proceed from the Father\" (John 15:26), which implies eternal origin and divine nature. This language isTrinitarian, affirming the deity and eternal procession of the Spirit. No Islamic theology attributes divine procession from the Father to Muhammad.Is Allah the Father?In Islam,Allah is not considered “Father”in any personal or relational sense (Qur’an 112:3; 5:18). This directly contradicts the New Testament revelation of God as theFather of our Lord Jesus Christ(Ephesians 1:3). Therefore, the God who sends the Comforter in John is the Christian God—theFather, not Allah of the Qur’an.Logical Conclusion: If Muhammad is Claimed to be the Comforter, Then Jesus Is Claimed to Be AllahIf one were to argue—contrary to both Christian and Islamic theology—thatMuhammad is the Comforter, then by necessity of John 15:26, one must also affirm that:Jesus sent Muhammad,Muhammad proceeded from the Father,and Muhammad glorifies and indwells believers.This would make Jesus the sender of a divine being, thereby placing Him in the position ofdivine authority and omnipotence, a status Islam explicitly denies. Therefore, such a claim logically and theologically leads to theaffirmation of Jesus’ divinity—ironically making Jesusequal with God, which contradicts Islamic monotheism (Tawḥīd).ConclusionThe identity of the Comforter as theHoly Spiritis clear in both the immediate and wider biblical context. Attempts to reinterpret this as a prophecy of Muhammad are not only theologically inconsistent but also historically and linguistically unfounded.Shalom,Max Shimba Ministries Org",

The Greek termParaklētos(παράκλητος) is translated as “Comforter,” “Advocate,” or “Helper.” The verse explicitly identifies this figure as“the Holy Ghost” (Holy Spirit)who will:Be sent bythe FatherComein Jesus’ nameTeachall thingsRemindthe disciples of what Jesus saidThe Holy Spirit, therefore, is a divine person within the Trinitarian framework of Christian theology. The Holy Spirit's role isthe continuation of Christ's presenceand teaching among the disciples, not a new prophetic mission that contradicts or supersedes the work of Christ.2. Was Muhammad Sent in the Name of Jesus?To assess whether Prophet Muhammad was sent “in Jesus’ name,” one must evaluate both Islamic and biblical evidence.John 14:26says the Comforter comes\"in my [Jesus'] name.\"This implies representation, continuation, and alignment with Jesus’ teachings and authority.However,nowhere in the Qurandoes Allah state that:Muhammad was sentin the name of Jesus.Muhammad would remind people of the sayings of Jesus.Muhammad's mission was to represent or continue Jesus' ministry.Rather, the Quran declares that Muhammad was sentas a warner to all people(Quran 7:158) and emphasizes hisdistinct prophethood, not one under the authority or name of Jesus.3. Is Allah the Father of Jesus?The Quran emphatically denies thefatherhood of Allahin any sense akin to the biblical understanding:“It is not befitting to (the majesty of) Allah that He should beget a son.”(Quran 19:35)“Say: He is Allah, the One... He begets not, nor was He begotten.”(Quran 112:1–3)In contrast, Christian theology, based on scriptures like Matthew 3:17 and John 3:16, affirms God as theFather of Jesus Christ, both ontologically and relationally. Thus, the divine Father who sends the Comforter in John 14:26cannot be equated with Allahof the Quran, who denies having a son.4. Does the Quran Mention a Comforter Sent by Allah?TheQuran does not mentiona “Comforter” (Paraklētos) or any similar figure described in the Gospel of John.Muslim apologists have historically attempted to claim thatMuhammad is the “Comforter” (Paraklētos)referred to in John 14–16. This is based on a speculative linguistic argument thatParaklētoswas originallyPeriklutos(\"praised one\") and thus refers toAhmad, another name of Muhammad mentioned in Quran 61:6:“Jesus, the son of Mary, said: O Children of Israel! I am the messenger of Allah to you, confirming that which was [revealed] before me in the Torah and bringing good news of a messenger who will come after me, whose name will be Ahmad.”However, nomanuscript evidencefrom the Greek New Testament supports this textual corruption. All known Greek manuscripts readParaklētos, notPeriklutos.Furthermore, the Comforter in John 14:26 is:TheHoly Spirit, not a manSent bythe Father, not by Jesus himselfIndwellingbelievers forever (John 14:16)These attributesdo not fit Muhammad, who was a human prophet who did not indwell believers nor came in Jesus’ name.5. Does the Quran Say Muhammad is a Comforter?No. TheQuran never refers to Muhammadusing the Greek concept ofParaklētos(Comforter, Advocate, or Helper).The Quran uses terms like:“Nadhir”(Warner) – Quran 33:45“Bashir”(Bearer of good news) – Quran 33:45“Abd”(Servant) – Quran 18:1But never does it equate Muhammad with theHoly Spiritor describe his mission in theJohannine termsused for the Comforter.ConclusionThere isno biblical or Quranic basisto identify Muhammad as the Comforter of John 14:26. The Comforter is clearly identified as theHoly Spirit, who proceeds from theFather in the name of Jesus, to continue Christ’s ministry by indwelling believers.Furthermore:Allah is not the Fatherof Jesus in Islam.Muhammad was not sent in Jesus’ name.TheQuran does not mentionany figure equivalent to theParaklētos.TheQuran does not call Muhammad a “Comforter.”Scholarly ReferencesBrown, Raymond E.The Gospel According to John, Anchor Bible Commentary.Köstenberger, Andreas.John, Baker Exegetical Commentary.Ibn Kathir,Tafsir al-Quran al-Azim.Yusuf Ali Translation of the Quran.Qadhi, Yasir.Introduction to the Sciences of the Qur'an.Final Note:Until the Quran explicitly states that Muhammad is a Comforter sent in Jesus' name, by the Father (who must be the Father of Jesus), and fulfills all Johannine descriptions of the Holy Spirit,conversion to Islam on that basis would be ungrounded.Soli Deo Gloria.Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

    "full_content": "A Critical Evaluation of the Sexual Rewards in Islamic EschatologyAbstractIslamic eschatology, as depicted in both the Qur'an and Hadith literature, offers vivid descriptions of Paradise, particularly emphasizing sensual and sexual pleasures for male believers. This paper critically evaluates these portrayals, analyzing Qur'anic verses, classical tafsir (exegesis), and Hadith traditions that promise houris—eternally virgin women—as part of the afterlife reward. It discusses the theological, ethical, and psychological implications of such representations and assesses whether these descriptions reflect divine holiness or exploit carnal desires as a motivational mechanism. The paper argues that these depictions challenge core theological concepts such as divine transcendence, moral consistency, and gender equity.1. IntroductionThe concept of Paradise (Jannah) in Islamic theology is rich with symbolic imagery and metaphysical promises. However, particular attention has been drawn to the sensual rewards offered to male adherents, especially the descriptions of houris—female companions characterized by perpetual virginity, physical beauty, and sexual availability. While many Muslims view these descriptions as metaphoric or allegorical, a literal interpretation dominates both traditional exegesis and popular understanding. This paper seeks to interrogate these portrayals through critical theological and psychological lenses.2. Qur’anic Descriptions of Houris and Physical RewardsThe Qur'an presents Paradise as a garden of eternal pleasure. Among its recurring themes is the promise of houris—female companions whose descriptions focus on beauty and sexual availability. Consider the following:Surah Al-Tur 52:20describes believers “reclining on adorned couches” and being “joined with fair women with large, beautiful eyes” (ḥūr ʿīn).¹Surah Al-Wāqiʿah 56:35–38elaborates: “Indeed, We have produced them [houris] in a new creation and made them virgins, devoted and of equal age.”²Surah Al-Nabaʾ 78:33references “full-breasted companions of equal age” (kawāʿib atrābā).³These verses have often been interpreted literally in early and classical tafsir.Al-Tabari, for instance, explains thatḥūr ʿīnare literal women created with perfect physical features specifically for the pleasure of male believers.⁴ Similarly,Al-Qurtubiconfirms thatkawāʿibrefers to women with “firm, round breasts,” again underscoring the sensual tone.⁵This consistent attention to female physical traits rather than mutual companionship suggests that the Qur’anic portrayal of Paradise, at least for men, is heavily focused on physical and sexual gratification.3. Hadith Literature: Hyperbolic Sexual RewardsThe Hadith corpus, which includes the sayings and traditions of Prophet Muhammad, further amplifies these descriptions with even more explicit details.Sunan Ibn Majah (Hadith 4337)states: “Every man who enters Paradise will be married to 72 wives; two from the houris and seventy from his share of the women of Hell.”⁶Musnad Ahmad (Hadith 13886)reports: “A believer will be given strength equal to one hundred men in terms of eating, drinking, and sexual intercourse.”⁷The medieval scholarAl-Suyuti, in his eschatological and angelological writings, vividly describes houris as pure beings so transparent that “the marrow of their bones can be seen through their flesh.” He adds that after every sexual act, the houris return to a state of virginity, and light shines from their genitals.⁸This level of graphic sensuality not only surpasses the Qur’an’s depiction but elevates the Paradise narrative into what could be perceived as religious erotica. Such depictions invite scrutiny about the nature of divine reward and whether these incentives reflect a spiritual, moral heaven—or a sanctified brothel.4. Theological and Ethical Implicationsa)The Nature of God and Moral IncentivesA central theological issue emerges: can a morally perfect and transcendent God promote righteousness by offering overtly carnal rewards? The depiction of Allah as a divine benefactor of endless sex and pleasure raises questions aboutmoral congruency. The Judaic-Christian vision of Heaven typically emphasizes union with God, spiritual peace, and the shedding of earthly desires. In contrast, the Islamic Paradise, when interpreted literally, seems to repackage theearthly appetites—particularly male sexual desires—into an eternal afterlife format.This leads to the ethical dilemma:Is obedience to God genuine if motivated by lustful reward?b)Gender Imbalance and Female MarginalizationAnother ethical concern lies in thegender imbalanceof Paradise. The Qur’an offers detailed descriptions of women as rewards for men, but little is said about what female believers receive. According toTafsir Ibn Kathir, righteous women will be reunited with their earthly husbands or married to other men in Paradise, but there is no equivalent mention of male houris or sensual reward for them.⁹This raises concerns aboutdivine justiceandequality. How can Paradise be a place of ultimate fairness if its rewards appear tailored to male pleasure at the expense of female agency?5. Psychological and Sociological AnalysisPsychologically, these descriptions may act ascompensatory fantasiesfor adherents living under strict social and sexual norms. By restricting sexuality on Earth but promising unlimited indulgence in the hereafter, the theology creates adelayed gratification systemthat may psychologically manipulate frustrated or vulnerable individuals. The depiction of a hyper-sexualized afterlife, filled with eternal virgins and enhanced male virility, appeals more to fantasy than to moral or spiritual growth.In radical contexts, these depictions have beenweaponized. Extremist groups have used the promise of 72 virgins as a recruitment tool, especially for suicide bombers. AsJessica Sternnotes in her bookTerror in the Name of God, this belief in instant sexual gratification post-martyrdom can serve as a strong motivational driver for disenfranchised youth.¹⁰6. Comparative PerspectiveIn Christian eschatology, Paradise (Heaven) is primarily depicted as aunion with God, a state ofspiritual fulfillment and divine presence(Revelation 21:3–4). Jesus teaches that in the resurrection, people “neither marry nor are given in marriage” but are “like angels in heaven” (Matthew 22:30), implying a transcendence of sexual identity and earthly desires.This contrast underscores a fundamentalphilosophical divergencebetween the Islamic and Christian concepts of the afterlife:corporeal fulfillmentversusspiritual communion.7. ConclusionThe Qur’anic and Hadith descriptions of Paradise, particularly the sexual rewards for male believers, present serious theological and ethical questions. The focus on houris, virginity, physical beauty, and hypersexual male potency seems more reflective ofearthly fantasiesthan divine holiness. These depictions challenge the notion of Paradise as a space of purity, equity, and spiritual elevation. Instead, they raise the possibility that Islam, at least in some interpretative traditions,uses sensual imagery as a means of psychological and ideological persuasion.Ultimately, any concept of divine reward that objectifies women and appeals to base desires should be reexamined through a lens of theological integrity, ethical consistency, and gender justice.BibliographyThe Qur'an, Surah Al-Tur 52:20.

This paper critically examines whether these descriptions align with spiritual ideals or instead reflect a materialistic and corporeal vision that arguably diverges from what is traditionally considered holy or divine.1. Qur’anic Descriptions of Houris (Heavenly Companions)The Quran outlines various rewards for the righteous in Paradise, among which are the so-called \"houris,\" described as beautiful companions with specific physical features. For instance:Surah Al-Tur (52:20)speaks of believers reclining on thrones, paired with companions with “wide and beautiful eyes.”Surah Al-Waqi’ah (56:35-38)goes further, stating that these women are made “new” (i.e., perpetual virgins) and are created specifically for their male partners in Paradise.Surah Al-Naba (78:33)vividly describes these companions as possessing \"full-breasted\" physiques, which many classical and modern commentators interpret as an appeal to male sexual desires.These verses, while interpreted differently among Muslim scholars—some allegorically, others literally—nonetheless contain explicit references to the physical and sexual nature of the rewards.2. Hadith Literature and Hyperbolic Sensual PromisesHadith collections such asSunan Ibn Majah (Hadith 4337)andMusnad Ahmad (Hadith 13886)further elaborate on these rewards. According to these sources:Each believing man is promised72 virgins.These virgins are described asperpetually pure,rejuvenated after each intercourse, and possessing light-filled bodies (cf. the commentary of Jalal al-Din al-Suyuti).Believers are endowed with exaggerated sexual potency—equal tothat of 100 men, and their sexual function is described in terms that modern readers might liken to \"eternal virility\" or \"divine Viagra.\"The explicitness of these descriptions has led to criticism that Islam's portrayal of Paradise appeals tocarnal fantasy rather than spiritual transcendence.3. Ethical and Theological ImplicationsThe theological challenge arises when these promises are compared to the nature of God as a moral lawgiver and spiritual guide. A fundamental question is whether it is appropriate—or even divine—for a deity to incentivize moral obedience with what appear to be overtly sexual rewards. From a philosophical standpoint, the promise of endless sexual gratification in exchange for piety raises the following ethical issues:Moral Incentivization or Sensual Manipulation?Does this depiction uplift the human soul toward transcendence, or does it exploit base desires to gain compliance?Divine Holiness vs. Carnal Marketing:Can a deity maintain moral transcendence while promising what appears to be a sexually indulgent afterlife? Would a loving father reward his son’s righteousness with what essentially amounts to a celestial brothel?Gender Inequality:The descriptions are clearlymale-centric, with little to no equivalent rewards outlined for women, raising further questions about gender justice in Islamic eschatology.4. Psychological InterpretationFrom a psychological perspective, one could argue that these sensual depictions function asmotivational tools, especially for individuals living under sexually repressive conditions. By promisingunattainable pleasuresin the afterlife, the system offers an escapist fantasy that may hold powerful psychological sway over young or sexually frustrated adherents. Such mechanisms are not unique to Islam but can be found in other religious and cultic ideologies throughout history.ConclusionThe sexualized vision of Paradise presented in Islamic texts—whether interpreted literally or metaphorically—raises significanttheological, ethical, and psychological concerns. The notion of divine reward rooted in eternal sensuality may suggest autilitarian model of religion, where obedience is bought not with spiritual fulfillment but with corporeal indulgence. This depiction invites deeper reflection on the nature of God, holiness, and the true essence of eternal reward. In doing so, it challenges us to ask whether such portrayals serve genuine spiritual purposes—or whether they function asreligious marketing, appealing to human instincts more than to divine ideals.",

One such encounter, often referred to in traditional Islamic sources as the Battle of Uhud, depicts the Prophet Muhammad suffering a serious physical assault at the hands of the Quraysh. This analysis will translate and explore the implications of this account.The Event DescribedIn Paragraph 1 of Page 57, Sheikh Farsy narrates that during a major battle between the Muslims and the Quraysh—presumably the Battle of Uhud—the Muslim forces were overwhelmed. The Quraysh launched a fierce counterattack, during which the Prophet Muhammad was physically assaulted. The following injuries are recorded:Muhammad was struck with stones.His teeth were broken.Iron nails (or weapons) were embedded into his cheeks.He lost consciousness and was presumed dead.In response to this attack, his companions rushed him to safety in the hills to protect him from being killed by the advancing Quraysh forces. The cause of this violent confrontation is attributed to Muhammad's mission of converting pagan Arabs to Islam.Dialogue Between Abu Sufyan and the CompanionsParagraph 2 provides an intriguing record of what transpired immediately after the battle. The leader of the Quraysh, Abu Sufyan, called out loudly:“Is Muhammad alive or dead? Is Muhammad alive or dead?”The Prophet instructed his companions not to respond. Abu Sufyan called out again:“Is Abu Bakr alive or dead?”Still, there was no response.Then he asked for the third time:“Is Umar alive or dead?”Again, silence followed.Thinking they had all perished, Abu Sufyan declared:“By Allah, all of them must be dead.”At this point, Sayyiduna Umar, unable to bear the false statement, raised his voice and responded:“All those whom you have mentioned are alive, and they are ready to meet you and your army at any time.”Theological ReflectionThis account invites critical reflection: Where was divine protection at this moment of brutal attack upon the Prophet of Islam? Why would a prophet, said to be the \"Seal of the Prophets,\" be subjected to such physical humiliation—losing his teeth and being presumed dead? Such reflections are common in interreligious debates, especially in Christian-Muslim apologetics, where divine protection over God's messengers is often emphasized.Concluding RemarksWhile Muslim sources present this as a testament to Muhammad’s perseverance and the trials of prophethood, others view the event as problematic when assessing divine providence and prophetic invincibility. The term“kibogoyo”in Swahili (meaning \"toothless\" or \"disfigured\") is used in some interpretations to describe the Prophet's physical condition post-battle, though such descriptors should be approached with scholarly care and respect in academic or interfaith discussions.Translated and Adapted by:Max Shimba Ministries OrgFor theological and historical studies in Islamic-Christian dialogue.",

    "full_content": "Title:A Comparative Theological Analysis of Salvation in Islam and Christianity: A Critical Evaluation of Eschatological CertaintyAuthor:Dr. Maxwell ShimbaAffiliation:USA Theological University, Orlando, FLAbstractThis paper critically examines the eschatological claims and concepts of salvation in Islam and Christianity. Particular attention is given to the uncertainty of salvation in Islamic theology as articulated in the Qur'an, and the contrastive assurance of salvation in Christian soteriology centered on the person of Jesus Christ. Drawing from scriptural texts in both the Bible and the Qur'an, the paper argues for the uniqueness of Christ’s redemptive role and the exclusivity of salvation through Him, while highlighting Muhammad's own uncertainty regarding his final destiny as recorded in Islamic scripture.1. IntroductionReligious beliefs concerning salvation and the afterlife constitute foundational aspects of any theological system. While both Islam and Christianity recognize a final judgment and the concepts of heaven and hell, the doctrines diverge significantly on the means and assurance of salvation. This paper aims to contrast the two perspectives by examining scriptural passages and theological implications within their respective frameworks.2. Muhammad's Uncertainty of Salvation in the Qur'anInQur’an 46:9, the Prophet Muhammad states:\"Say, [O Muhammad], 'I am not something original among the messengers, nor do I know what will be done with me or with you. I only follow that which is revealed to me...'\"(Surah Al-Ahqaf 46:9, Sahih International)This passage reveals a startling theological position: even Muhammad himself was uncertain of his own final outcome, as well as that of his followers. Islamic commentators, such as Al-Tabari and Al-Qurtubi, have offered various interpretations to mitigate this verse’s implications. However, the plain reading conveys a deep uncertainty concerning salvation, even for the Prophet of Islam.Such uncertainty raises an essential question for Islamic soteriology:If the messenger himself is unsure of his final destiny, what assurance is available for ordinary believers?3. The Inevitability of Hell in Islam: Qur'an 19:71Further compounding this theological ambiguity isQur’an 19:71, which states:\"And there is none of you except he will come to it [Hell]; this is upon your Lord an inevitability decreed.\"(Surah Maryam 19:71)While some scholars argue that “coming to it” may refer to merely passing over hell (via the bridge of Sirat), the use of the Arabic term\"wariduha\"(will arrive at it) often implies a literal entry. Several Hadith sources also confirm that even Muhammad feared hellfire and frequently prayed for protection from it.Thus,Islam appears to present no absolute assurance of paradise, instead emphasizing personal deeds, Allah’s mercy, and divine will.4. The Certainty of Salvation in ChristianityIn contrast, Christianity proclaimsguaranteed and personal salvationthrough Jesus Christ.John 14:6records Jesus’ exclusive claim:“I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.”Furthermore,John 3:36states:“Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.”These verses underscore a unique claim within Christianity:salvation is assured for those who believe in Jesus Christ. The New Testament presents eternal life not as a future possibility but as a present possession for believers (cf. John 5:24).5. The Exclusivity of Christ’s Redemptive RoleThe apostolic teaching inActs 4:12affirms the exclusivity of Christ’s role in salvation:“There is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.”This absolute claim distinguishes Christianity from all other religions, including Islam. Unlike Muhammad, who expressed uncertainty about his destiny, Jesus spoke with divine authority and promised eternal security to all who trust in Him.6. Comparative Eschatological EthicsJesus’ words inMatthew 15:14serve as a moral and theological warning:“If the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit.”This metaphor applies fittingly to any religious system whose founder lacks assurance of salvation. A guide who does not know his destination cannot provide confident direction to others.7. ConclusionThe contrast between Islam and Christianity on the subject of salvation is stark and theologically consequential. Islam offers no assurance of eternal life even to its prophet, while Christianity provides certain and secure salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. The invitation of Christ inJohn 10:9remains open:“I am the door. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved.”The implication is clear:To reach heaven, one must follow Jesus. To follow any other path is, by biblical teaching, to risk eternal separation from God.ReferencesThe Qur’an, Surah 46:9; Surah 19:71 (Sahih International).The Bible, John 14:6; John 3:36; Acts 4:12; Matthew 15:14; John 10:9.Al-Tabari,Tafsir al-Tabari, Vol. 26.Al-Qurtubi,Tafsir al-Qurtubi, Surah 19.R.

    "full_content": "The Satanic Verses and the Daughters of Allah in Early Islam: A Scholarly Historical ExaminationIntroductionThe historical records of early Islam reveal a fascinating and controversial incident known as the \"Satanic Verses.\" This event suggests that Prophet Muhammad, at one point, uttered verses acknowledging the intercessory powers of three pagan deities worshipped by the Quraysh:al-Lat, al-Uzza, andManat. These verses were later abrogated and declared to have been inspired by Satan, not Allah. This study examines the historical, theological, and scholarly significance of this incident through Islamic sources.1. The Incident of the Satanic Verses (Gharaniq Story)This event is recorded in early Islamic historiography and supported by various early scholars. According to the narrative, Prophet Muhammad initially recited a verse recognizing the three daughters of Allah as intercessors:“These are the exalted Gharaniq (cranes) whose intercession is hoped for.”This was allegedly revealed after Muhammad recitedSurah al-Najm (53:19–20)which names the three pagan goddesses. The Quraysh rejoiced, believing that their deities had been honored. However, Muhammad later retracted these verses, stating they were not from Allah but whispered by Satan.2. The Three Daughters of AllahPre-Islamic Arabs believed in Allah as the supreme deity, but they also worshipped His so-called daughters:al-Latal-UzzaManatThese were viewed as divine intercessors, and their worship was deeply ingrained in Qurayshi religious practices. Surah al-Najm 53:19-20 mentions them by name:“Have you considered al-Lat and al-Uzza? And Manat, the third – the other one?”(Qur’an 53:19-20)While the current Qur’an rebukes this belief in subsequent verses, early narratives indicate that Muhammad initially affirmed their intercession under satanic influence.3. Classical Islamic Sources Confirming the IncidentThe Satanic Verses incident is affirmed by several early and authoritative Islamic scholars, including:Ibn Ishaq(d. 767/773 CE)— In hisSirat Rasul Allah, the earliest biography of Muhammad.al-Wahidi(d. 823 CE)— In his commentaryAsbab al-Nuzul(Occasions of Revelation).Ibn Sa’d(d. 845 CE)— InKitab al-Tabaqat al-Kabir.al-Tabari(d. 923 CE)— In his monumentalTarikh al-Rusul wa al-Muluk(History of the Prophets and Kings).These scholars unanimously acknowledge the occurrence of the incident, making it difficult to dismiss as fabrication.4. Qur’anic Affirmation of Satan’s InfluenceWhile later Muslim scholarship often denies the authenticity of the Satanic Verses, the Qur’an itself seems to reference this event:Surah 22:52“Never did We send a messenger or prophet before you but when he desired, Satan threw into his desire; but Allah abolishes what Satan throws in, then Allah makes precise His verses.”Surah 17:73-75“And indeed, they were about to tempt you away from that which We revealed to you... And if We had not strengthened you, you would have almost inclined to them a little.”These verses suggest that even prophets can be momentarily misled by satanic influence, though ultimately corrected by God.5. Rebuttals and ResponsesSome modern Muslim apologists attempt to reject this incident based on various grounds:Weak or unverified isnad(chain of narration)Absence from Sahih Hadith collectionslike Bukhari or MuslimTheological incompatibilitywith the doctrine of prophetic infallibility (ʿisma)However, responses to these objections include:The chains are multiple and traced to early sources close to Muhammad’s era.Many early Muslim historians accepted the story without hesitation.The incident is cited to explain the revelation of Qur’an 22:52.Rejecting the incident due to discomfort is not a scholarly approach, especially when early sources affirmed it.6. Theological ImplicationsIf the incident is authentic, several significant implications arise:Doctrinal Integrity:The prophetic claim of uncorrupted divine revelation is questioned.Prophetic Infallibility:If Muhammad could speak Satan’s words, even briefly, it undermines the claim of absolute prophetic purity.Biblical Contrast:The Bible claims that true prophets never utter false prophecy (Deut. 18:20–22). In contrast, this incident would render Muhammad—however briefly—a false prophet.ConclusionThe Satanic Verses incident is not merely a myth fabricated by critics, but a historical event affirmed by early Islamic authorities. It reveals a significant moment where Muhammad allegedly delivered a revelation from Satan, only to retract it later. Whether one is a Muslim, Christian, or academic historian, this event warrants serious attention due to its profound theological consequences.ReferencesIbn Ishaq,Sirat Rasul Allahal-Tabari,Tarikh al-Rusul wa al-Mulukal-Wahidi,Asbab al-NuzulIbn Sa’d,Kitab al-Tabaqat al-KabirQur’an: 22:52, 17:73–75, 53:19–20",

An Investigation into Islamic and Biblical Teachings on MagicBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Max Shimba Ministries OrgAbstractThis paper explores the controversial claim that the Quran contains teachings of sorcery and that such teachings are endorsed by Allah. Drawing from Quranic verses, particularly Surah Al-Baqarah 2:102, as well as biblical injunctions against witchcraft, the article critically assesses whether Islamic sources promote the use of sorcery. Furthermore, the study investigates the theological implications of this claim in contrast with Judeo-Christian ethics on witchcraft. The article concludes with a biblical apologetic perspective rooted in monotheistic orthodoxy.1. IntroductionWitchcraft and sorcery have long been sources of fear and fascination across cultures and religions. In both African traditional religions and global spiritual contexts, magic is often seen as a force capable of harming, controlling, or manipulating human affairs. Within this discourse, an emerging theological question arises:Does the Quran condone or teach sorcery?More specifically,Does Allah authorize or teach magic for use against others?These questions deserve thorough scriptural and theological evaluation.2. The Nature and Effects of SorceryWitchcraft is commonly believed to bring harm to its victims, including strife, infertility, disease, mental distress, and even death. Many believe that through sorcery, malevolent individuals may send animals such as bats, birds, or flies to attack their enemies spiritually. In traditional African belief systems, this is not merely folklore but a daily spiritual reality.The Bible acknowledges the existence of such powers. For instance, in Matthew 12:43–45, Jesus refers to evil spirits that leave a person and return later with more wicked spirits, emphasizing the influence of demonic forces in human affairs. However, Jesus also underscores that these spirits are ultimately subordinate to God’s sovereignty.3. Does the Quran Teach Magic?A particularly striking verse in the Quran isSurah Al-Baqarah (2:102), which reads:“They followed what the devils used to recite during the reign of Solomon. Solomon did not disbelieve, but the devils disbelieved; they taught people magic and that which was revealed to the two angels, Harut and Marut, in Babylon. Yet these two would not teach anyone without first warning, ‘We are only a test, so do not disbelieve.’ But people learned from them what could cause separation between a man and his wife, though they could not harm anyone except by Allah’s permission...”(Quran 2:102)This verse presents several profound theological challenges:Magic (sihr)was allegedly taught bydevilsand also bytwo angelsnamed Harut and Marut.Allahpermittedthe existence and operation of this magic, though framed as a “test.”The magic involved had the power toseparate husbands and wives, a highly personal and destructive effect.The Quran claims that this magic could not operate unlessAllah permitted it, implying divine sanction.Such passages raise the question:If Allah permits magic and allows angels to teach it, even as a test, does that not make Him complicit in the spread of evil?4. Islamic Occultism and Traditional Healing PracticesThroughout the Muslim world—especially in East Africa and the Middle East—there exist Islamic traditional healers, often known aswaganga wa kienyejiorIslamic spiritual doctors, who claim to heal or curse using verses from the Quran. These healers often invokejinn (spirits)and use specificQuranic verses, amulets, and charms (known astaweez) in their practices.This presents a paradox: the Quran is considered the holy word of Allah, yet it is used in contexts reminiscent of occultism. What is the theological relationship between Allah, the Quran, and these practices of magic or spirit invocation?5. Biblical Teaching on Witchcraft: A Contrasting EthicThe Bible provides unambiguous commandments concerning witchcraft. Unlike the Quranic account, the biblical position is zero-tolerance:Leviticus 19:26:\"Do not practice divination or seek omens.\"Leviticus 20:27:\"A man or woman who is a medium or spiritist among you must be put to death.\"Deuteronomy 18:10–14:“Let no one be found among you who...practices divination or sorcery, interprets omens, engages in witchcraft, or casts spells...Anyone who does these things is detestable to the Lord.”The God of Israel (Yahweh) condemns sorcery not only as dangerous but also as an abomination. No angel in the Bible is portrayed as a teacher of sorcery. In fact, angelic beings serve only the will of God and are depicted as holy messengers who oppose demonic influences.6. Theological ImplicationsIf Allah permits the teaching of harmful magic—even as a \"test\"—then His moral character comes into question. A God who enables or sanctions dark arts for any reason becomes fundamentally incompatible with the God revealed in the Bible, who is holy, righteous, and cannot be tempted by evil (James 1:13).Furthermore, if Quranic verses can be employed for magical purposes—as in exorcisms, curses, and healing rituals involving jinn—this indicates that the sacred text itself contains latent occult power. This stands in stark contrast to the Bible, which attributes all miraculous or spiritual power to God alone, mediated by the Holy Spirit, never by human manipulation or rituals.7. Conclusion: A Biblical Call to DiscernmentThis investigation suggests that there are elements within Islamic texts and practices that appear to endorse or facilitate sorcery. While some Muslim scholars argue that such practices are distortions of true Islam, the Quranic evidence, particularly from Surah 2:102, remains problematic.Christians are called to reject all forms of sorcery and to rely solely on the power of God through Jesus Christ. The Holy Spirit—not mystical rituals, charms, or angels teaching magic—is the true source of spiritual power in the life of a believer. As the Apostle Paul declares:“For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers... Wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God...”(Ephesians 6:12–13)ReferencesThe Quran, Surah Al-Baqarah 2:102The Holy Bible, New International Version (NIV)Mambo ya Walawi (Leviticus) 19:26; 20:27Kumbukumbu la Torati (Deuteronomy) 18:10–14Matthew 12:43–45James 1:13Ephesians 6:12–13",

It critically explores how methods such as migration, asylum, education, and employment are utilized as tools for ideological expansionism. While acknowledging the diversity within Islamic communities, this article focuses on certain radical agendas aimed at transforming host nations into Islamic states governed by Sharia law. The study further evaluates the implications of religious-political hybridization for national sovereignty, religious freedom, and cultural preservation in non-Muslim majority societies.IntroductionThroughout history, religious ideologies have played pivotal roles in shaping political, cultural, and social landscapes. Islam, one of the major world religions, has witnessed both peaceful propagation and violent expansion. This article does not generalize all Muslims but focuses on radical elements that are alleged to employ subtle yet strategic methods to infiltrate, dominate, and transform non-Muslim societies into Islamic caliphates. Such radical ideology views the entire world as a potential Islamic state governed by Sharia law, and pursues this goal through both peaceful and violent means.1. Methods of Infiltration and Expansion1.1 Migration as a Tool of InfluenceMigration has long been a natural phenomenon in human history, often driven by economic, political, or environmental factors. However, certain Islamic ideological movements view migration (Hijrah) not only as a necessity but as a sacred duty and a strategic tool for expanding the Ummah (Islamic community). Through mass migration, Muslims settle in non-Muslim territories under the guise of seeking opportunity or refuge, but with an underlying agenda to Islamize their new environment over time.1.2 Refugee Asylum and Humanitarian ExploitationThe global refugee crisis has presented opportunities for Islamic radicals to enter foreign countries, particularly in the West and Africa, under humanitarian grounds. Host nations—motivated by compassion and international law—welcome these refugees and provide them with access to housing, healthcare, education, and civil liberties. Ironically, many of the rights offered are absent or severely restricted in their countries of origin, where strict Sharia law is enforced.1.3 Education and EmploymentMuslim students and workers often enter host nations through scholarships or work permits. While many genuinely seek better opportunities, radical ideologues may exploit this access to establish ideological strongholds within universities, workplaces, and civic institutions. As their numbers increase, they often form religious associations and pressure institutions to accommodate Islamic practices, leading to cultural shifts and gradual Islamization of public spaces.2. Early Stages of ConcealmentWhen Muslim populations are small, their presence is often characterized by peaceful coexistence. During this phase, Islamic leaders emphasize messages of tolerance, peace, and mutual respect, carefully avoiding public criticism of other religions or cultures. Religious gatherings are conducted discreetly, and political activism is minimal. However, beneath this peaceful appearance, efforts are often underway to increase Muslim populations through high birth rates and strategic marriages, thereby gradually shifting demographic balances.3. The Turning Point: From Minority to Political ForceWhen Muslims reach a significant proportion of the population—often around 50%—a noticeable transformation occurs. The community begins to demand political representation, Islamic legal courts (e.g.,Kadhicourts), and increased funding for Muslim institutions. Political parties and advocacy groups are formed to push Islamic interests. Religious structures such as mosques, madrassas, and Islamic centers multiply rapidly across the country.In some countries, radical Muslim groups begin to mobilize through protests, strikes, and civil disobedience campaigns, often citing religious discrimination. In extreme cases, churches are burned, pastors are attacked with acid, and there are increased reports of religiously motivated violence. This marks a significant shift from passive integration to aggressive demands and societal restructuring.4. Full-Scale Islamization and AuthoritarianismIn advanced stages, when Muslim populations exceed native or Christian communities, radical factions may initiate more aggressive actions:Religious Suppression: Prohibiting church construction and outlawing public Christian worship.Cultural Erasure: Banning indigenous traditions, renaming institutions, and converting churches into mosques.Legal Transformation: Imposing Sharia law, which often includes harsh penalties, child marriage, gender inequality, and restrictions on freedom of expression.Terror Tactics: Suicide bombings, assassinations, and destruction of government buildings become tactics to instill fear and coerce submission.Intimidation and Coercion: Individuals are threatened to convert to Islam or face death, mimicking historic jihadist campaigns.At this stage, constitutional law is replaced by Islamic law. Non-Muslims are reduced to second-class citizens (dhimmis), their freedoms revoked, and their cultural identities systematically dismantled. Native populations become refugees within their own homelands.5. Case Studies: Nations Under ThreatSeveral countries have either succumbed to or are currently facing the impact of such infiltration tactics:Tanzania & Kenya: Radical Islamist groups have targeted Christian communities with acts of violence and church burnings.Nigeria: The Boko Haram insurgency aims to establish an Islamic state, killing thousands of Christians.Egypt: The Coptic Christian population faces persistent persecution.France & the UK: Radicalization among migrant populations has led to terrorism, community segregation, and challenges to secular values.The Netherlands & Germany: Growing Islamic populations have led to rising demands for parallel legal systems.Conclusion and RecommendationsThis analysis does not seek to promote religious hatred or generalize all Muslims as extremists. Rather, it highlights the tactics used by certain radical factions that exploit religious freedom, humanitarian compassion, and liberal democracy to undermine non-Muslim societies. These strategies represent a form of stealth conquest—not by armies, but by ideology and demographics.Recommendations:Increased Vigilance: Governments should monitor radical religious groups operating under the guise of cultural or religious institutions.Civic Education: Citizens must be educated about ideological infiltration and the importance of preserving democratic and pluralistic values.Balanced Immigration Policy: Nations should reform immigration laws to prevent the influx of individuals from radicalized zones without thorough vetting.Interfaith Dialogue: Promote genuine interfaith dialogue that fosters transparency, equality, and mutual respect rather than submission to any ideology.Call to ActionIt is time for host nations to awaken to this growing ideological threat. Hospitality must never become a gateway for domination. The values of freedom, human dignity, and religious plurality must be defended against all forms of totalitarian encroachment, whether political or religious. Societies must act decisively to protect their heritage and uphold the principles of justice, peace, and true coexistence.Reflect. Be Alert. Take Action.",

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis concluding chapter synthesizes the theological, logical, and historical evidence presented in this investigation into the Islamic claim that the Injeel (Gospel) has been corrupted. Drawing on Quranic affirmations, manuscript traditions, theological doctrines of divine preservation, and rational-critical analysis, this final section evaluates the plausibility of textual corruption and reaffirms the integrity of the Injeel within the framework of Abrahamic faiths and historical-critical scholarship.1. IntroductionThroughout this seven-part investigation, we have sought to examine, with both academic rigor and theological sensitivity, the oft-repeated Islamic assertion that the Injeel has been corrupted. This question is not only theological in nature but also bears immense implications for interfaith dialogue, epistemology, and the historicity of sacred texts.To assess this claim, we have approached it from multiple dimensions: Quranic testimony, the internal witness of the Injeel and other Scriptures, logical coherence, and the manuscript history of the New Testament.2. Quranic Affirmation of the Injeel’s IntegrityThe Qur’an, far from suggesting corruption of the Injeel, emphatically affirms its divine origin and continued authority:Surah Al-Ma’idah 5:46– “And We sent, following in their footsteps, Jesus, the son of Mary, confirming that which came before him in the Torah; and We gave him the Injeel, in which was guidance and light…”Surah Al-Ma’idah 5:47– “So let the People of the Gospel judge by what Allah has revealed therein. And whoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed – then it is those who are the defiantly disobedient.”Surah Al-Baqarah 2:136andSurah Al-Imran 3:84command Muslims not to distinguish between revelations, acknowledging the Torah, Psalms, Injeel, and the Qur’an as equally inspired by God.Notably, there isno Quranic verse that explicitly declaresthe corruption (تحريف) of the Injeel as a whole. While there are references to certain individuals misinterpreting or concealing scriptures (e.g., Surah 2:79), these do not amount to doctrinal claims of total textual corruption.3. Theological Analysis: Can God's Word Be Corrupted?All three Abrahamic faiths agree on a fundamental attribute of God: Hissovereignty and omnipotence. From this flows the theological axiom thatGod’s Word cannot be thwarted or nullified by human interference.Psalm 119:89– “Forever, O LORD, your word is firmly fixed in the heavens.”Isaiah 40:8– “The grass withers, the flower fades, but the word of our God will stand forever.”Matthew 24:35– “Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.”Qur’an 6:115– “And the word of your Lord has been fulfilled in truth and in justice. None can change His words.”Therefore, from both Christian and Islamic theology,it is inconsistent to assert that mere mortals could corrupt the very revelation God has willed to preserve.4. Logical Reasoning: Interrogating the ClaimLet us now apply the principle of logical inquiry to the claim of corruption. Any such claim must answer the following five critical questions:4.1Who corrupted the Injeel?There is no historical or textual evidence pointing to a person, group, or empire capable of coordinating a global revision of Scripture. Christianity by the 2nd century had already spread across Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. No ecclesiastical body wielded such totalitarian control.4.2Why was the Injeel corrupted?There is no coherent or compelling motive proposed by Islamic traditions. What gain would early Christians have achieved by fabricating a Messiah who died and rose from the dead—only to be persecuted and martyred for such a message?4.3When was it corrupted?Was it before or after Prophet Muhammad?Before Muhammad?– Then why does the Qur’an affirm the Injeel in its existing form? Why does it instruct Christians to judge by it?After Muhammad?– Then why does the Qur’an not warn of this future corruption? Why is there no abrogation of the verses that promote belief in the Injeel?4.4Which parts were corrupted?If onlypartsof the Injeel were allegedly corrupted, then:Which verses exactly?Who made that determination?Where is the uncorrupted version?Muslim scholars historically have not presented a reliable, objective method to discern genuine from spurious verses—leaving the claim largely unsubstantiated.4.5Where is the original Injeel?According to textual scholars, the Gospels we possess today—particularly in codices such asCodex Vaticanus,Codex Sinaiticus, andCodex Alexandrinus—reflect what was written in the 1st century. There is no manuscript trail, archaeological evidence, or historical record suggesting an alternative \"original Injeel.\"5. Historical Analysis: The Transmission of the InjeelAs explored in Part 6, the Injeel was written by eyewitnesses and their close companions between ~50–95 AD. The process of transmission involved:Geographical dispersion: From Jerusalem to Antioch, Alexandria, Corinth, Rome, and beyond.Extensive copying and citation: By the 4th century, thousands of manuscript copies, in Greek and various translations (Latin, Coptic, Syriac), were in circulation.Church Fathers’ Quotations: Early theologians like Irenaeus, Tertullian, and Origen quoted the Injeel extensively—providing secondary verification of its content.Given this diffusion and attestation, it would be historically and logisticallyimpossiblefor anyone—church or empire—to collect, alter, and re-distribute all these copies without historical trace or protest.6. Martyrdom and TestimonyThe suggestion that the disciples fabricated the Gospel narratives collapses under scrutiny. The apostles:Claimed to witness Jesus’ life, death, and bodily resurrection.Were imprisoned, tortured, and executed—yet never recanted.Did not gain wealth or political power but suffered rejection, exile, and martyrdom.People may die for what theybelieveis true. Butno one dies for what they know to be a lie.7. Final ConclusionAfter examining the theological testimony, logical framework, historical manuscript evidence, and the human cost paid by the original followers of Jesus, we arrive at a conclusive assessment:There is no credible basis—textual, historical, theological, or logical—for asserting that the Injeel has been corrupted.This claim remains unsupported by:Quranic revelationHistorical documentationTextual criticism or manuscript evidenceRational analysisInstead, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the preservation of the Injeel as the authentic record of Jesus’ message. To assert corruption is to deny the ability—and promise—of God to protect His Word.8. Implications for Interfaith DialogueThis conclusion holds profound significance for both Muslims and Christians. If we affirm that:The Injeel has not been corrupted,The Qur’an affirms the Injeel,The Gospels accurately preserve Jesus’ message,Then the path is open for mutual dialogue rooted inhistorical honesty,textual integrity, andtheological consistency. Rather than division, such inquiries can lead to deeper understanding and respect between the two faiths.Recommended ReadingsBruce Metzger,The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and RestorationF.F.

An Academic and Theological InvestigationPart 3 of 7 – What Do the Other Holy Books Say About God’s Word?By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThe question of the textual integrity of theInjeel(Gospel) has long been debated between Muslim and Christian theologians. While some Islamic perspectives hold that the Injeel has been tampered with or altered over time, a closer examination of both the Qur’anic and Biblical records reveals a far more complex theological narrative. In this part of our academic investigation, we explore the internal testimony of the Holy Scriptures—namely, the Injeel (New Testament), the Tawrat (Torah), the Zabur (Psalms), and the words of the Prophets such as Isaiah—to ascertain what they themselves say concerning the nature, preservation, and authority of the Word of God.I. The Divine Inspiration and Authority of ScriptureA foundational theological claim within the Christian tradition is that all Scripture istheopneustos—“God-breathed.” The apostle Paul, writing to Timothy, makes this unequivocally clear:2 Timothy 3:16-17 (NIV):“All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.”The Greek termθεόπνευστος (theopneustos)denotes divine origin and affirms the ontological relationship between God and His written revelation. Likewise, Peter underscores the spiritual mechanics behind prophecy:2 Peter 1:20-21 (NIV):“Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet’s own interpretation of things. For prophecy never had its origin in human will, but prophets, though human, spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.”This emphasis on divine origination and spiritual guidance implies that the words of Scripture are not merely historical or literary artifacts, but the living and authoritative revelation of God.II. The Endurance and Fulfillment of God’s WordThe Injeel, according to Jesus Himself, affirms not only the authenticity but also the enduring permanence of the divine message transmitted through earlier revelations. Jesus, in the Sermon on the Mount, made the following statement:Matthew 5:17-18 (NIV):“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.”Here, “Law and Prophets” refer explicitly to theTawratand the canonical prophetic writings—documents which also include theZabur. Jesus confirms both their continuity and divine preservation.Moreover, inMatthew 24:35, Jesus declared:“Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.”This is a significant theological claim. It implies the immutability and permanence of Jesus’ teachings. If the words of Jesus (who is referred to in both Christian and Islamic traditions as theWord of God—see John 1:1, Revelation 19:13; Surah 3:45 and Surah 4:171) are eternal, then the corruption of such words is not only improbable but theologically untenable.III. God’s Protection Over His WordThe final book of the New Testament—the Revelation of John—provides a solemn warning concerning the manipulation of God’s Word:Revelation 22:18-19 (NIV):“I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this scroll: If anyone adds anything to them, God will add to that person the plagues described in this scroll. And if anyone takes words away from this scroll of prophecy, God will take away from that person any share in the tree of life and in the Holy City...”This warning reflects a divine protection mechanism over Scripture, reinforcing the notion that the preservation of God’s Word is not left to human discretion alone, but is under divine oversight.IV. The Eternal Nature of God’s Word in the Zabur and Prophetic BooksThe Psalms (Zabur), traditionally attributed to Prophet Dawud (David), offer some of the clearest declarations about the eternal and unchanging nature of God's Word:Psalm 119:89 (NIV):“Your word, LORD, is eternal; it stands firm in the heavens.”Psalm 119:152 (NIV):“Long ago I learned from your statutes that you established them to last forever.”Psalm 119:160 (NIV):“All your words are true; all your righteous laws are eternal.”Similarly, the prophet Isaiah confirms:Isaiah 40:8 (NIV):“The grass withers and the flowers fall, but the word of our God endures forever.”Isaiah 59:21 (NIV):“My Spirit, who is on you, will not depart from you, and my words that I have put in your mouth will always be on your lips...from this time on and forever.”These affirmations stand as theological pillars regarding the immutability and divine preservation of revelation.V. The Theological Dilemma of Alleged CorruptionGiven the above scriptural testimony, we are faced with a critical theological dilemma: Can the Word of God truly be corrupted when these very Scriptures repeatedly affirm its divine origin, its preservation, and its enduring nature?If the Injeel, Tawrat, and Zabur arekalimatullah—the Word of God—then to claim they are corrupted poses a challenge to both God's sovereignty and His promise to protect His Word. The Qur'an itself echoes these affirmations in places like:Surah 3:3:“He has revealed the Book to you with truth, confirming what was before it, and He revealed the Torah and the Gospel.”Surah 5:46-47:“And We sent, following in their footsteps, Jesus, the son of Mary, confirming that which came before him in the Torah; and We gave him the Gospel...”Surah 6:34:“There is none that can change the words of Allah...”Thus, for the Muslim reader, any claim of the corruption of the Injeel must be reconciled with these Qur’anic affirmations. If Allah revealed the Gospel and declared His words unchangeable, then the claim that His Word has been altered introduces a contradiction.ConclusionThe internal testimony of the Holy Books—across the Tawrat, Zabur, and Injeel—provides a unified voice: God's Word is inspired, divinely protected, and eternally enduring. The evidence presented reveals that the claim of corruption cannot be sustained without undermining the very Scriptures and divine attributes affirmed in both the Bible and the Qur'an.To suggest that God failed to protect His Word is to suggest that human agency is more powerful than divine sovereignty—an idea antithetical to both Islamic and Christian theologies.Coming Next:Part 4 – A Theological Investigation: What Does the Qur’an Say about the Bible’s Integrity?Dr. Maxwell ShimbaPresident, Shimba Theological InstituteBiblical Theologian | Interfaith Apologist | Scholar of Comparative Religion",

AN INVESTIGATIONPart 1 of 7 – IntroductionBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba | Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionAs-salāmu ʿalaykumto my respected Muslim brothers and sisters, Christian readers, and all seekers of truth. This academic series endeavors to carefully and critically examine a significant theological claim prevalent in Islamic tradition—that theInjeel(Arabic: الإنجيل), commonly understood as the Gospel or New Testament, has been corrupted (taḥrīf, تحريف). This claim, if true, carries profound implications not only for Christian theology but also for interfaith understanding between Muslims and Christians. If false, however, then it compels a reevaluation of commonly held assumptions and doctrines about the scriptures prior to the Qur'an.We therefore invite readers of all backgrounds and beliefs to approach this study with an open mind, intellectual curiosity, and a shared commitment to truth and historical integrity.What Is the Injeel?The termInjeeloriginates from the Arabicالإنجيل, which is etymologically derived from the Greek wordeuangelion(εὐαγγέλιον), meaning “good news” or “glad tidings.” This term was already in use by Arab Christians in the pre-Islamic era, referring to the message of Jesus the Messiah (ʿĪsā al-Masīḥ, عيسى المسيح) as preserved in the canonical New Testament writings.The Injeel, in Christian theological context, is not a single book revealed to Jesus word-for-word (as often assumed in Islamic doctrine), but rather the eyewitness testimonies of Jesus’ life, teachings, crucifixion, and resurrection as recorded by His disciples and earliest followers under divine inspiration. These include the four canonical Gospels—Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John—as well as the writings of the apostles that form the foundation of the New Covenant inaugurated by Christ.The Islamic Mandate to Believe in Previous ScripturesThe Qur’an instructs its followers to believe in the previous revelations: theTawrat(Torah), theZabur(Psalms), and theInjeel(Gospel), among others. Numerous verses emphasize the divine origin of these scriptures. For example, Surah Al-Ma’idah (5:46) says:\"And We sent, following in their footsteps, Jesus, the son of Mary, confirming that which came before him in the Torah; and We gave him the Gospel, in which was guidance and light...\"(Qur’an 5:46, Sahih International)Surah Al-Imran (3:3) similarly affirms:\"He has sent down upon you the Book in truth, confirming what was before it. And He revealed the Torah and the Gospel.\"(Qur’an 3:3)These verses assert not only that God revealed the Gospel, but that it contained “guidance and light”—a clear endorsement of its divine authority.Yet, despite these affirmations, many Muslims refrain from reading or consulting the New Testament, on the grounds that it has allegedly been altered or corrupted. This belief stems from the doctrine oftaḥrīf, which holds that previous scriptures were either misinterpreted, misrepresented, or deliberately changed over time by human hands.The Doctrine ofTaḥrīf(تحريف)The Islamic concept oftaḥrīfcan be classified into different interpretations by classical Muslim scholars:Taḥrīf al-lafẓī– corruption of the actual text.Taḥrīf al-maʿnawī– distortion of the meaning or interpretation.Taḥrīf al-nasḫ– abrogation of earlier scriptures by subsequent revelations.Over time, many Islamic scholars argued that the Jews and Christians altered the original messages of God either by editing the texts themselves (textual corruption) or by distorting their meanings (interpretive corruption). Consequently, it is claimed that God sent the Qur’an as the final, preserved, and incorruptible revelation to correct these distortions.However, this doctrinal development raises a series of important theological, historical, and logical questions, which form the basis of this investigation. If God truly revealed the Torah, the Psalms, and the Gospel, and commanded believers to follow them, would He then allow His Word to be lost or irretrievably corrupted before the final revelation? And if so, does this not undermine the reliability of any divine scripture, including the Qur’an?Purpose and Scope of This StudyIn this seven-part academic series, we will undertake a thorough investigation into the question:Is the Injeel corrupted?This inquiry will not be polemical, but scholarly and respectful, relying on classical sources, scriptural analysis, historical evidence, and rational inquiry. The goal is not to win arguments, but to seek truth in the light of divine revelation, history, and reason.The study will be divided into the following parts:Introduction– Defining terms and framing the issue.(You are here.)What Does the Qur’an Say About the Injeel?What Did the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and Early Muslims Say About the Injeel?What Is the Historical Evidence for or Against Corruption?What Do Christian and Jewish Sources Say About Their Scriptures?Logical and Theological Analysis of the Doctrine ofTaḥrīfConclusion: Is the Injeel Corrupted? A Balanced AssessmentThroughout this journey, we will also compare scriptural teachings from the Qur’an, the Bible, and other historical documents. The purpose is to clarify misunderstandings, correct misrepresentations, and build bridges of understanding across faiths.A Call to Honest InquiryFinally, I urge every reader—Muslim, Christian, or otherwise—to approach this study not with defensiveness, but with humility and courage. If the Injeel is indeed the Word of God, preserved and attested to by history and by the very Qur’an that affirms it, then it deserves to be read, studied, and honored. And if questions remain, let us confront them with integrity and mutual respect.Let the words of the Qur’an guide our attitude as we investigate:\"Say, 'Bring your proof if you are truthful.'\" (Qur’an 2:111)Let us therefore bring our proofs, examine them, and seek the truth together.Coming Next: What Does the Qur’an Say About the Injeel?Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

    "full_content": "By Max Shimba Ministries OrgAbstractThis paper explores the theological implications of Qur’an 6:7, which presents a hypothetical situation wherein God sends down a physical book on parchment to the Prophet Muhammad. Despite such tangible evidence, the Qur’an states that disbelievers would still accuse the revelation of being \"clear sorcery.\" This passage raises critical questions about the origin, function, and reception of thewrittenQur’an (the paper Qur’an) and the possibility that its physical form may, in some interpretations, be associated with mystical or magical connotations. We reflect on the implications of this verse from both Islamic and biblical perspectives and question whether the paper Qur’an, as used and perceived today, aligns with divine intention—or has become a medium of misunderstanding and superstition.1. IntroductionThe Qur’an, revered by Muslims as the literal word of God revealed to Prophet Muhammad, is believed to have been delivered orally over a period of 23 years. However, after the Prophet’s death, the oral recitations were compiled into a written form—what we now call theMus-haf, or the paper Qur’an.In Surah Al-An‘am 6:7, the Qur’an makes a provocative statement:\"And even if We had sent down to you (O Muhammad) a book written on parchment, and they touched it with their hands, the disbelievers would have said, 'This is nothing but obvious sorcery.'\"— Qur’an 6:7This verse invites an inquiry:Where did the modern paper Qur’an originate from, and why does the Qur’an anticipate that its physical form might be called sorcery?2. Translation of the Original Swahili StatementSwahili Original:QURAN YA KARATASI IMETOKA WAPI?KUMBE QURAN YA KARATASI NI UCHAWI.وَلَوْ نَزَّلْنَا عَلَيْكَ كِتَابًا فِي قِرْطَاسٍ فَلَمَسُوهُ بِأَيْدِيهِمْ لَقَالَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا إِنْ هَـٰذَا إِلَّا سِحْرٌ مُّبِينٌ[Surah Al-An‘am: 7]Na lau tungeli kuteremshia kitabu cha karatasi, wakakigusa kwa mikono yao, wangeli sema walio kufuru: Haya si chochote ila ni uchawi dhaahiri.Hii Quran ya kitabu chenye karatasi imetoka wapi?Hakika Quran ya karatasi ni uchawi.English Translation:Where did the paper Qur’an come from?So then, the Qur’an in paper form is sorcery.“And had We sent down to you (O Muhammad) a book written on parchment, and they touched it with their hands, those who disbelieved would have said, ‘This is nothing but clear sorcery.’”— [Surah Al-An‘am 6:7]Where did this paper version of the Qur’an originate?Indeed, the Qur’an in paper form is sorcery.3. Textual and Theological AnalysisThe verse in question anticipates human skepticism and suggests that even the clearest, tangible form of divine revelation would still be rejected by unbelievers. This raises a theological paradox:If God foresaw that a written, touchable scripture would be dismissed as sorcery, why did Islam later adopt and canonize such a physical format?The Arabic phrasekitāban fī qirṭās(a book on parchment) implies avisible, physical document, as opposed to the originaloral revelation.The termsiḥr mubīn(clear magic) reflects the reaction of hardened hearts, not the nature of the message—but the association between scripture and sorcery remains troubling in interpretation.4. Historical Shift: From Oral Revelation to Written TextInitially, the Qur’an was transmitted orally through memorization (ḥifẓ). It was only compiled into a written manuscript during the caliphate of Abu Bakr and standardized by Caliph Uthman. This raises an important question:Is the written Qur’an an inspired format, or a human convenience prone to misinterpretation?Furthermore, the use of the paper Qur’an in talismans, amulets, and ritual healing in various cultures reinforces the original fear:has the Qur’an, in its physical form, been transformed into an object of superstition or magical belief—exactly as the Qur’an warned?5. Comparative Reflection: Scripture and SuperstitionIn the Bible, God’s Word was given bothorally(e.g., prophets) andin written form(e.g., tablets, scrolls), but it always pointed totransformation of the heart, not magical outcomes. Jesus condemned those who sought signs and wonders (Matthew 12:39) instead of repentance.In contrast,Islamic reverence for the physical Qur’anhas, in some settings, overshadowed the call to spiritual obedience. The physical book is sometimes treated as a sacred object, even when not read or understood. This can lead tobibliolatry(worship of the book) rather thantrue devotion to God.6. ConclusionQur’an 6:7 provides a powerful warning:the medium of revelation does not guarantee belief.Tangibility is not the answer to disbelief. Ironically, the modern printed Qur’an, treated by some with superstitious reverence or used in magical practices, may fulfill the very criticism leveled by the disbelievers in the verse.Thus, it is right to ask: where did the paper Qur’an come from—and what has it become?If it leads to faith and truth, it is a vessel of God's word.If it becomes a tool of fear, talismanic ritual, or blind reverence,then it has become, as the verse says, “nothing but manifest sorcery.”Shalom,Max Shimba Ministries Org",

    "full_content": "Title: Questioning the Authenticity of the Quran and the Prophethood of Muhammad: An Academic Inquiry into the Role of Jibril and His Alleged EnemyBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThe foundational claim of Islam is that the Quran is the verbatim word of Allah, revealed to the Prophet Muhammad via the angel Jibril (Gabriel). However, emerging critical studies—textual, theological, and historical—raise questions regarding the authenticity and reliability of such claims. This article examines Quran 2:97 in light of the concept of the “enemy of Jibril” and investigates the possibility that deceptive spiritual entities may have infiltrated Muhammad’s prophetic experiences. This analysis engages Quranic verses, Hadith literature, and classical Islamic sources while integrating Christian theological frameworks to assess the plausibility of divine versus deceptive revelation.1. IntroductionThe Quran makes bold claims about its divine origin, stating repeatedly that it is the “Word of Allah” (Quran 6:19, 10:37, 45:6). Muslims believe that Jibril (Gabriel) delivered the entire Quran to Muhammad over a 23-year period. However, an under-examined but critical verse in the Quran—Surah Al-Baqarah 2:97—mentions thatthere are individuals who are \"enemies of Jibril.\"The implications of this are far-reaching: Could Jibril have been impersonated? Could deceptive revelation have occurred? Did Muhammad himself differentiate between authentic and counterfeit spiritual visitations?2. Textual Analysis of Quran 2:97\"Say, whoever is an enemy to Gabriel—it is [none but] he who has brought it [i.e., the Qur'an] down upon your heart, [O Muhammad], by permission of Allah, confirming that which was before it...\"(Quran 2:97)The verse is often interpreted as a response to Jewish or other tribes who denied Jibril’s authority. However,the existence of an “enemy” of Jibril implies opposition to the transmission of divine revelation.It is theologically reasonable to ask:Could this enemy be spiritual in nature?Could a spiritual deceiver have masqueraded as Jibril?Classical exegetes like Al-Tabari and Ibn Kathir ignore this possibility, yet such neglect reveals a significant gap in critical exegesis.3. Was Muhammad Deceived by a Spirit Masquerading as Jibril?One of the most controversial accounts in early Islamic tradition is the episode of theSatanic Verses—reported inIbn Ishaq, Al-Tabari, and others, where Muhammad allegedly recited verses praising the pagan goddesses Al-Lat, Al-Uzza, and Manat. These verses were later abrogated and replaced, with the claim thatSatan \"interjected\" them(see Quran 22:52):\"Never did We send a messenger or a prophet before you but when he recited the message, Satan cast into his recitation...\"This verse not only confirms satanic interference in prophetic messages, but it also leaves open the door for amisidentification of spirits.If Satan can cast words into the mouth of a prophet, could he also impersonate the medium of transmission—Jibril?4. Was the Enemy of Jibril Wearing the \"Form\" of Jibril?The Hadith literature reveals that Jibril often came in various forms, including the form ofa man with black hair and white garments(Sahih Muslim, Book of Faith). This anthropomorphic presentation invites the possibility thatanother spiritual entity could mimic Jibril’s form.In 2 Corinthians 11:14, Paul warns:\"Even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.\"If Muhammad was unaware of this theological danger, the question arises:Was he equipped to discern the real Jibril from a deceptive imposter?5. The Identity of the Enemy of JibrilWho, then, is this “enemy of Jibril”? Islamic sources vaguely reference Jewish antagonists, but a spiritual reading suggestsa deeper force—Satan himself, or his demonic agents, opposing and potentiallyinterveningin divine communication. Theologically, this enemy could have:Introduced errors into Muhammad’s recitation.Masqueraded as Jibril in key revelations.Influenced controversial verses (e.g., violence, sexual rewards in Paradise, abrogation of earlier scriptures).6. Muhammad’s Silence on the Enemy of JibrilNotably, Muhammad never explicitly warned his followers aboutthe potential deception of spirits—a critical omission when compared to Biblical prophets who emphasized testing spirits (1 John 4:1). The absence of any criteria for validating angelic revelation further undermines the trustworthiness of Muhammad’s experience.7. Implications for the Authenticity of the QuranIf Muhammadcould not definitively distinguish between Jibril and a deceptive spirit, several troubling consequences arise:The Quran may contain verses not from God.Theological contradictions (e.g., Quran 4:157 vs. history of crucifixion) may stem from confusion.The legitimacy of Muhammad’s entire prophethood is under question.The claim that the Quran is perfectly preserved loses force ifanypart of it was delivered under deception.8. ConclusionThe figure of the “enemy of Jibril” in Quran 2:97, when read critically, opens a theological and epistemological crisis for Islam. If satanic forces could interfere, impersonate, or manipulate revelation—as affirmed by Quran 22:52 and the Satanic Verses tradition—then the door is wide open todoubt the authenticity of the Quran. Furthermore, Muhammad’s own inability to detect and expose the enemy of Jibril severely undermines his credibility as a prophet.Until Islamic scholarship addresses these critical concerns honestly, the Quran’s divine claim remains academically and spiritually questionable.Author: Dr. Maxwell ShimbaPresident and Senior Scholar, Shimba Theological InstituteSpecialist in Comparative Theology, Prophetic Criticism, and Qur’anic Analysis",

Rooted in Quran 2:97, this theory is often hidden or downplayed by Islamic clerics, especially in their teachings to Muslim youth. Through exegetical analysis, theological evaluation, and comparative textual study, this article seeks to explore whether the Quran itself supports or contradicts the idea that Jibril (Gabriel) was truly the messenger of divine revelation—or whether another spiritual force masquerading as Gabriel delivered the Quran.Introduction:The Quran is traditionally believed by Muslims to be the literal word of Allah, revealed to the Prophet Muhammad by the angel Jibril (Gabriel). However, certain Quranic verses, particularlyQuran 2:97, have raised questions regarding the true nature of this revelation and whether Islamic tradition has suppressed alternative readings or interpretations. This article addresses the controversial argument that thetrue enemy of divine truth posed as Jibril, deceiving Muhammad and giving rise to the Quran.Quran 2:97 – Literal Translation and Classical Interpretation:Quran 2:97 (Sahih International):“Say, 'Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel—it is [none but] he who has brought it [i.e., the Quran] down upon your heart, [O Muhammad], by permission of Allah, confirming that which was before it and as guidance and good tidings for the believers.’”This verse is a response to the Jewish tribes of Medina who, according to Islamic sources (e.g., Tafsir Ibn Kathir), rejected Gabriel because they believed he was a bringer of war, unlike Michael, who was associated with mercy.Key Observations:Gabriel is described as the conveyor of the Quran.The verse assumes someoneisan enemy of Gabriel.This opens up theological space: Can Gabriel be opposed? And could another spirit impersonate him?Theological Dilemma: Can an Angel of God Be Rejected or Misidentified?If Jibril is an angel of Allah and the bearer of divine truth, how can someone legitimately be his \"enemy\"? In biblical and Jewish thought, angels of God are holy, and hostility toward them is equivalent to hostility toward God (cf. Zechariah 3:1, where Satan accuses Joshua before the angel of the Lord).Could it be that Quran 2:97 subtly reveals thatthe spirit whom Muhammad encountered may not have been the true Gabriel? Could it be acounterfeit angel, akin to Paul’s warning in2 Corinthians 11:14:“And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.”Early Islamic Sources: Muhammad's Fear of Demonic PossessionIslamic historiography provides support for this line of questioning:Sahih Bukhari, Vol. 9, Book 87, Hadith 111:Muhammad initially feared he waspossessed by a jinn(evil spirit) after his first encounter with the angel in the cave of Hira.He contemplated suicide, thinking the presence was demonic—not angelic.Why would a true prophet fear divine revelation?Unless, perhaps, the spirit he encountered bore not the peace of God but the confusion of deception.The “Enemy of Gabriel” as a Masked Deceiver?In theological perspective, particularly from Christian and Jewish traditions, an enemy of Gabriel cannot be human only—it may be spiritual. If Gabriel is a divine messenger, then his \"enemy\" could beSatan, who opposes all of God's messengers.Thus, if Quran 2:97 mentionsan enemy of Gabriel, it may be aspiritual force in opposition to the divine Gabriel—and yet cunning enough to poseasGabriel to deceive.Could it be thatthis “enemy” took Gabriel’s form and brought the Quran, deceiving Muhammad, who was initially unsure of the encounter’s authenticity?This would explain:Why Muhammad doubted the experience.Why the Quran contradicts previous revelations (Torah and Gospel).Why the content of the Quran glorifies war, misogyny, and deception—traits alien to biblical revelation.Scholarly Silence and Islamic Clerical SuppressionIn modern Islamic education:Critical verses like 2:97 are not emphasized in their theological depth.Youth are toldwhat to believe, not encouraged toread and question.Commentaries (tafsir) often deflect attention from the spiritual implications of the text.This has led to anintellectual stagnationwhere alternate readings of verses like Quran 2:97 are actively suppressed. The fear is that deeper investigation might lead to the conclusion thatthe Quran is a spiritual counterfeit.Conclusion:Quran 2:97 may unintentionally reveal more than traditional Islamic scholars admit. The mention of an \"enemy to Gabriel\" is not just a throwaway phrase—it is the key to understanding a deeper spiritual battle over the source of the Quran. When coupled with Muhammad’s initial fear of possession, and Paul's warning about Satan masquerading as an angel of light, a compelling theological case arises:The enemy of Gabriel may have been the actual source of the Quran—deceiving Muhammad, claiming to be Gabriel, and thereby leading millions into theological darkness.This claim demands deeper scholarly and theological reflection, especially among Muslims who seek the truth. For seekers of light, this verse may be the very doorway to discovering the spiritual conflict behind Islam’s origin.References:The Quran, Surah Al-Baqarah 2:97Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 87:111Tafsir Ibn Kathir – Commentary on 2:972 Corinthians 11:14 (New Testament)Zechariah 3:1 (Old Testament)Samuel M.

    "full_content": "Title:Moral Integrity and Historical Narratives: A Critical Examination of Aisha bint Abi Bakr in Early IslamAuthor: Dr. Maxwell ShimbaInstitution: Max Shimba Ministries OrgCorrespondence:info@maxshimbaministries.orgAbstractThis article critically examines the moral character of Aisha bint Abi Bakr—one of the wives of Prophet Muhammad—based on early Islamic sources. Despite being revered in Islamic tradition as the “Mother of the Believers,” this study interrogates her portrayal in Hadith literature, especially focusing on her early marriage, controversial behaviors, and the “Incident of Ifk” (accusation of adultery). The piece argues that these narratives raise profound ethical and theological concerns when measured against contemporary moral standards. Finally, it contrasts Islamic teachings with the Christian understanding of moral integrity as exemplified in the life and teachings of Jesus Christ.1. IntroductionIn Islamic history and tradition, Aisha bint Abi Bakr holds an esteemed place as one of the Prophet Muhammad’s wives and a significant narrator of Hadith. Referred to as “Umm al-Mu’minin” (Mother of the Believers), her life and character continue to influence Islamic jurisprudence and gender roles. However, critical analyses of Islamic sources reveal troubling narratives that warrant scholarly scrutiny.2. Reverence in Islam: The Elevated Status of AishaMuslims revere Aisha not only as the Prophet’s wife but also as the daughter of Abu Bakr, the first Caliph. Hadiths fromSahih al-BukhariandSahih Muslimrecord the Prophet’s deep affection for Aisha. For instance:“Who is the most beloved person to you, O Messenger of Allah?” He said, “Aisha.” Then he asked, “And among the men?” He said, “Her father.” – (Bukhari)Islamic traditions also assert that Aisha was exonerated from accusations of adultery through divine revelation from the seventh heaven (Surah An-Nur 24:11–26), confirming her purity.3. The Marriage ControversyAisha’s marriage to Muhammad has sparked moral and academic debate. According toSahih Bukhari (Vol. 7, Book 62, Hadith 88)andSahih Muslim (Book 8, Hadith 3309–3311), Aisha was married to Muhammad at age six and the marriage consummated when she was nine.“The Prophet married me when I was six years old, and consummated the marriage when I was nine.” – Aisha (Bukhari)The psychological, social, and moral implications of this marriage have led to considerable debate. Critics argue that this relationship reflects a moral dissonance when viewed through a modern ethical lens, especially considering the age of the bride and the authority of the groom.4. Questionable Behaviors and Public AppearancesHadiths also depict scenes where Aisha, still a child, observed Abyssinian men dancing in the mosque courtyard while being shielded under the Prophet's garment.“I kept watching them until I was satisfied and turned away.” – (Bukhari Vol. 7, Book 62, Hadith 163)This narrative raises questions about Aisha’s psychological and social development. How could a child of nine, not yet having reached puberty, express interest in such entertainment? Some argue that this reflects early exposure to adult dynamics, potentially compromising childhood innocence.5. The Incident of Ifk (Adultery Accusation)A central controversy surrounding Aisha is the\"Ifk Incident\", narrated in early Islamic sources likeIbn HishamandIbn Ishaq, where Aisha was accused of committing adultery withSafwan ibn al-Mu'attal.The Prophet, distressed by the scandal, sent Aisha back to her parents. Although Surah An-Nur later declared her innocence, the initial public reaction in Medina—including suspicions from companions like Ali ibn Abi Talib—raises ethical concerns regarding the Prophet’s judgment and the broader communal suspicion.6. Jealousy and Insecurity in the Prophet's HouseholdHadith literature records Aisha expressing jealousy towards Khadijah, Muhammad’s first wife, despite Khadijah having died before Aisha joined the household:“Why do you keep remembering that old woman with red gums?” – Aisha (Bukhari Vol. 5, Book 58, Hadith 168)Such statements reflect emotional immaturity and possible insecurity, further complicating her image as a moral exemplar and religious authority.7. Critical ReflectionsGiven these documented incidents—from early marriage to jealousy, public dancing, and a major accusation of adultery—questions arise:Can Aisha be considered a moral authority and role model for Muslim women?Moreover, if the Prophet's household was marked by jealousy, rivalry, and scandal, can Muhammad be upheld as the model of family and spiritual leadership?8. A Christian Contrast: The Way, the Truth, and the LifeIn contrast, Christianity presents Jesus Christ as the ultimate moral exemplar. InJohn 14:6, Jesus states:“I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.”This declaration offers:A singular moral pathbased on love, purity, and righteousness.Eternal lifefound only in divine truth—not human traditions marred by questionable ethics.Christianity emphasizes spiritual rebirth, moral transformation, and a standard of holiness unattainable through legalism or flawed human examples.9. ConclusionWhile Islamic tradition venerates Aisha and Muhammad, critical historical and textual analysis reveals a more complex and morally troubling narrative. From the early marriage to scandals and household tensions, these accounts raise doubts about their moral credibility.Only Jesus Christ—untainted by sin, fully divine and fully human—offers a reliable and holy path to God.“Reflect. Question. Take Action. Come to Jesus.”ReferencesSahih Bukhari, various Hadith collections.Sahih Muslim, various Hadith numbers.Ibn Hisham,Sirat Rasul Allah.Ibn Ishaq,Life of Muhammad(translated by A. Guillaume).The Holy Bible, John 14:6 (New King James Version).The Holy Qur’an, Surah An-Nur 24:11–26.",

A Biblical and Qur’anic Ethical and Medical ExaminationBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaMax Shimba Ministries OrgAbstractThis article investigates the controversial subject of anal sex (commonly referred to in Swahili astigo) within Islamic and Christian frameworks. Using both scriptural analysis and medical findings, the study aims to shed light on whether such a practice is condoned in either the Qur’an or the Bible and what implications arise for individuals who engage in it. Particular attention is given to the medical risks for women, the ethical contradictions between Islamic and Christian teachings, and the spiritual consequences of engaging in acts deemed unnatural.IntroductionA concerned individual named Michael recently posed a troubling dilemma: his Muslim wife, unhappy in their marital intimacy, confessed that she had previously engaged in anal intercourse with a former partner and wished to return to him unless her current husband agreed to fulfill that specific sexual desire. Michael, though not yet a Christian, was aware that his Christian upbringing prohibited such acts. His concern centers around whether Islam truly permits anal sex, and what the Bible and Qur’an say about it.This article aims to address the following fundamental questions:Does Islam permit anal intercourse?What are the health implications of anal sex, particularly for women?What do the Bible and the Qur’an teach on this issue?Is there a spiritual or moral consequence for either approving or rejecting the act?I. Qur'anic Perspective on Anal Intercourse1. Qur'an 2:222–223The Qur'an states:“They ask you concerning menstruation. Say: It is a harm, so keep away from women during menstruation... Your wives are a tilth for you, so go to your tilth when and how you will...”(Qur'an 2:222–223)While this passage appears metaphorical, various Islamic scholars and Hadiths have interpreted the phrase“go to your tilth as you will”as permitting various forms of sexual expression. However, the interpretation is contested.2. Classical Islamic InterpretationsAccording toAd-Durr al-Manthur(vol. 1, p. 474) andFath al-Bari(vol. 8, pp. 38–39), a narration by Naafi reports that Abdullah ibn Umar believed this verse referred to anal intercourse. This view has stirred debate within the Islamic world, with some scholars accepting it and others strictly condemning it as haram (forbidden).II. Christian (Biblical) PerspectiveThe Bible speaks clearly against unnatural sexual acts, not only between men and animals but also acts deviating from natural intercourse between husband and wife.1. Leviticus 20:13–16“If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination... If a man marries a woman and her mother, it is depravity... If a man has sexual relations with an animal, he must be put to death...”These scriptures reveal that unnatural sexual acts, including same-sex relations and bestiality, are consideredabominationsbefore God. Although not explicitly addressing anal sex within marriage, the broader biblical ethic upholds sexual purity and natural order as defined in Genesis (2:24).III. Medical and Psychological ImplicationsMedical researchers have raised several concerns about anal intercourse, particularly for women:1.Damage During ChildbirthWomen who regularly engage in anal sex may experience weakened anal sphincter muscles, resulting in incontinence during labor.2.Increased Risk of Colon CancerPersistent trauma and irritation of the rectal area can lead to chronic inflammation, increasing the risk of colon cancer.3.Loss of Sphincter ControlWith age and repeated exposure, women may lose control over bowel movements due to weakened sphincter muscles.4.Death of the Child During LaborDue to misaligned pressure and anatomy disruption, a child’s oxygen flow may be cut during birth as a result of a mother’s damaged pelvic muscles.These risks highlight why many women—especially those who report having experienced this practice in Islamic-majority settings—suffer long-term physical and psychological harm.IV. Ethical and Spiritual ConsiderationsThe Bible teaches that:“My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.”(Hosea 4:6)“You are in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God.”(Matthew 22:29)From a Christian worldview, sexual behavior is not merely physical but deeply spiritual. Acts against natural design violate the Creator’s intention and bring both physical and spiritual consequences. Thus, if a holy book permits practices that result in moral decay and physical damage, its divine origin must be questioned.V. Comparative Theological ReflectionScripturePermits Anal Intercourse?Spiritual VerdictQur’anInterpreted by some as YesEthically ambiguousBibleNo (Implicitly and morally)Explicitly condemnedGiven the contradictory positions, one must ask: Can a divine book contradict the natural, physical, and moral order established by the Creator? If so, can such a book genuinely be from the true and holy God?ConclusionAnal sex (Tigo) is both physically harmful and spiritually destructive. The Qur’an, through some interpretations, permits it, leading to widespread normalization among certain groups. The Bible, on the other hand, upholds the sanctity and naturalness of sexual intimacy within marriage, warning against deviations.Final AppealTo all who desire truth, health, and spiritual clarity: Seek Jesus, the Way, the Truth, and the Life.(John 14:6)RecommendationsFor Christians:Do not compromise spiritual convictions for the sake of physical intimacy.For Muslims:Reexamine your scriptures and consult the Bible as the final authority of divine morality.For all:Let us uphold both physical health and spiritual integrity in our relationships.Contact & MinistryMax Shimba Ministries OrgProclaiming the Truth in Love and Boldness[Visit us for more:www.maxshimbaministries.org]",

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba – Shimba Ministries OrgAbstractThis paper critically explores the origins of Islam and its eschatological claims in light of Biblical prophecy. It poses essential questions about the violent nature of certain Islamic doctrines, the confusion within Islamic eschatology, and the identity of the Islamic Messiah—Imam al-Mahdi—as it relates to the figure of the Antichrist in the Bible. Through comparative religious analysis, the study seeks to uncover whether Islamic teachings align with the character of the God revealed in Scripture, and if Islam plays a role in the end-time events foretold in the Bible.1. Introduction: The Global Quest for TruthThroughout history, human societies have persistently asked fundamental questions:Where did the universe come from?Why does religion often involve suffering and hatred toward non-believers?Why is there more doctrinal confusion in Islam than in Christianity?Why does Allah permit the killing of non-believers?Why is Islam historically spread more through warfare than through love?These questions have led many scholars and thinkers to scrutinize the origins and character of Islam and its founder, Muhammad.2. The Origins of Muhammad and His LineageMuhammad came from the tribe ofBanu Hashim, meaning“sons of Hashim.”According to the Urban Dictionary, the nameHashimcan be interpreted as “destroyer.” [Source: UrbanDictionary.com]Thus, etymologically, Muhammad could be described as a “son of the destroyer.” Presently, many Muslims await the coming ofImam al-Mahdi, whom Islamic sources claim will be from the lineage of Muhammad, making him likewise a “descendant of the destroyer.”3. Islamic Eschatology and the Coming of Imam al-MahdiAccording toTirmidhiandAbu Dawud, Muhammad is reported to have said:“The world will not pass away until a man from among my family, whose name will be my name, rules over the Arabs.”(Tirmidhi, Sahih, Vol. 9, p.74; Abu Dawud, Sahih, Vol. 5, p.207)Further Islamic tradition describesImam al-Mahdi:“He will have a broad forehead and a prominent nose. He will fill the earth with justice as it had been filled with oppression and tyranny. He will rule forseven years.”(Abu Dawud, Sahih, Vol. 2, p.208; Fusul al-Muhimma, p.275)4. The Biblical Parallel: The Antichrist and the Seven-Year ReignThe Bible prophesies of a ruler to come, commonly identified as theAntichrist, who will sign aseven-year covenant of peace, deceiving even the Jewish people.“He will confirm a covenant with many for one ‘seven.’ In the middle of the ‘seven’ he will put an end to sacrifice and offering.”(Daniel 9:27)One \"week\" (Hebrew:shabua) = 7 days = 7 years (prophetic scale)Midpoint = 3½ yearsReign = 7 years of deceit, destruction, and global dominationThis description aligns with the Islamic belief thatImam al-Mahdi will rule for seven years—a significant eschatological parallel.5. Islam’s Role in the Last Days According to the BibleMuslims frequently declare:“Islam will dominate the world.”While this may occur temporarily, theBible clearly warnsthat this dominion will only last for seven years—after which divine judgment will fall.“Then I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was given to them. And I saw the souls ofthose who had been beheaded because of their testimony about Jesus and because of the word of God…”(Revelation 20:4)This verse prophetically describes thebeheading of Christians—a form of execution practiced and sanctioned in some Islamic traditions.6. Key Theological Questions RaisedThe following reflective questions arise when comparing Biblical truth to Islamic eschatology:Who on earth is most offended by the claim that Jesus is God?Which religion historically and currently practices beheading as punishment for religious dissent?What will Imam al-Mahdi, when he takes global leadership, do to those who profess Jesus as God?Jesus warned:“The time is coming when anyone who kills you will think they are offering a service to God. They will do such things because they have not known the Father or Me.”(John 16:2-3)7. Theological Implications and ConclusionThe Bible teaches that in the last days, adeceptive ruler will rise, ushering in a time of persecution and mass executions of believers in Christ. This Antichrist figure shares remarkable similarities with theIslamic Mahdias described in Hadith literature.While some denominations such asSeventh-Day Adventistshave traditionally associated the Antichrist with the Roman Papacy, the eschatological data within both Islamic and Christian textsstrongly point toward Islam's eschatological figure as the likely Antichrist.Thus, Christians must discern the times andstudy the true Word of God, so that they are not deceived by doctrines contrary to the Gospel of Christ.“You shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.”(John 8:32)BibliographyThe Holy Bible, Daniel 9, Revelation 20, John 16Hadith Sources:Sunan Abu DawudJami’ al-TirmidhiFusul al-MuhimmaUrbanDictionary.com definition of “Hashim”Scholarly commentaries on Islamic and Christian eschatology",

    "full_content": "Title: The Marital Transition of Muhammad After Khadijah: An Analytical and Theological InquiryBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaMax Shimba Ministries OrgAbstractThis article examines the marital life of Muhammad, specifically focusing on the sudden increase in his number of wives after the death of his first wife, Khadijah. By drawing from Islamic sources, particularlySahih Bukhari, and by analyzing historical and sociocultural dynamics of 7th-century Arabia, the article explores whether Muhammad's monogamous commitment to Khadijah stemmed from sincere affection, strategic necessity, or social constraint. The study also investigates what his post-Khadijah polygamy suggests about his personal inclinations and theological motivations.IntroductionThe marriage of Prophet Muhammad to Khadijah bint Khuwaylid stands as a significant point in the Prophet’s biography. It is often cited by Muslim scholars as an example of a faithful and noble marital relationship. However, an observable shift occurred after Khadijah’s death: Muhammad rapidly married multiple women. This article seeks to examine the possible motives behind that shift and to assess whether his early monogamy was due to genuine affection, social dependence, fear, or pragmatic survival.Key Questions for ConsiderationSeveral critical questions emerge from this marital transformation:Did Muhammad have a particular preference for older women?Was he initially against polygamous marriages?Did he fear Khadijah and thus refrain from taking other wives?Was his love for Khadijah genuine or conditional?Each of these inquiries opens a window into understanding Muhammad’s character, values, and strategic decisions in his formative years and prophetic mission.Historical Context: Poverty, Orphanhood, and SecurityMuhammad was an orphan who grew up under the care of various relatives. His early life was characterized by poverty and instability. At the age of 25, he married Khadijah, a wealthy merchant widow who was 15 years his senior. Importantly, it was Khadijah who proposed marriage, a fact that reverses traditional gender norms in Arab society of the time.This marriage offered Muhammad not only emotional companionship but also material security. It is plausible to argue that this union provided the first stable home he had ever known. In that light, his commitment to Khadijah may have stemmed from a deep sense of gratitude, economic dependency, and psychological comfort—factors that likely outweighed romantic or sexual interests.Hadith Evidence: The Desire for VirginsA telling hadith found inSahih Bukhari(Volume 3, Book 34, Number 310) sheds light on Muhammad's preferences:“The Prophet asked Jarir bin ‘Abdullah: ‘Have you got married?’ He replied, ‘Yes.’ The Prophet asked, ‘A virgin or a matron?’ He replied, ‘A matron.’ The Prophet said, ‘Why not a virgin so that you may play with her and she with you?’”This conversation suggests that Muhammad saw particular appeal in marrying virgins—indicative of a desire possibly unfulfilled during his marriage to Khadijah. It leads one to infer that abstaining from such desires during the earlier marriage may not have been due to disinterest but due to situational or emotional constraints.The Explosion of Polygamy Post-KhadijahAfter Khadijah’s death, Muhammad’s marriage pattern changed dramatically. Within a few years, he had married multiple women, many of whom were younger and from various tribes. This rapid shift may signify the lifting of a social or emotional constraint that was previously limiting him. The metaphor of \"a prison gate being broken\" is fitting: it implies that Khadijah’s presence possibly served as a moral, emotional, or strategic restraint on Muhammad’s polygamous desires.Additionally, these marriages had political, social, and religious functions: they were used to forge alliances, secure loyalty, and provide shelter to widows. However, the speed and volume of these marriages raise questions about personal motivations versus public duties.Conclusion: Was the Monogamy Tactical?It is reasonable to consider that Muhammad's monogamy during his marriage to Khadijah was not necessarily a lifelong conviction but perhaps a necessity rooted in his precarious social status and the power dynamic within that marriage. Once Khadijah—his primary source of security—was gone, Muhammad had the liberty and motivation to explore marital options that may have long appealed to him.This study does not claim to reduce Muhammad’s marriage to Khadijah to mere opportunism, but rather suggests a complex interplay of survival, gratitude, affection, and unfulfilled desires. The post-Khadijah polygamy, therefore, reveals a deeper aspect of his personality and provides scholars with fertile ground for examining the human side of the Prophet of Islam.ReferencesSahih Bukhari, Volume 3, Book 34, Hadith 310Guillaume, A.The Life of Muhammad: A Translation of Ibn Ishaq’s Sirat Rasul AllahWatt, W.

It evaluates the theological, moral, and metaphysical implications of this promise and draws comparative insights from biblical eschatology and demonological literature. The study further explores whether such a promise aligns with the broader framework of Abrahamic monotheism and suggests that these 'houris' and the 'inheritance from hell' reflect metaphors of demonic sensuality rather than divinely sanctioned gifts, proposing a provocative thesis: that these seventy beings represent the infernal rather than the celestial. The work concludes with implications for interfaith dialogue and eschatological anthropology.IntroductionIslamic eschatology, as derived from the Qur'an and Hadith, often emphasizes the sensual rewards awaiting the faithful in paradise. Among the most controversial narrations is the promise ofseventy-two virgins(houris) to male believers admitted to Jannah (Paradise). This motif has been especially highlighted in jihadist rhetoric and critiques of Islamic theology by non-Muslim scholars. A particularly revealing narration is found inSunan Ibn Majah 4337, which states:“There is no one whom Allah will admit to Paradise but Allah will marry him to seventy-two wives, two from houris and seventy from his inheritance from the people of Hell, all of whom will have desirable front passages and he will have a male member that never becomes flaccid.”—(Sunan Ibn Majah, Book 37, Hadith 238, English translation: Vol. 5, Book 37, Hadith 4337)This article evaluates the theological and moral implications of this narration and posits that these figures — referred to as 'inheritance from the people of Hell' — suggest an association with demonic entities rather than divine blessings.The Hadith Tradition and Its Eschatological PromisesHadith collections such asSahih al-Bukhari,Sahih Muslim,Sunan Abu Dawud, andSunan Ibn Majahrecord sayings attributed to Muhammad, forming the secondary source of Islamic jurisprudence and theology after the Qur'an. The notion ofhouris— beautiful, untouched, immortal women — is elaborated in Qur'anic passages such asSurah Al-Rahman 55:72andSurah Al-Waqi'ah 56:22-23. Yet, the addition of 'seventy from his inheritance from the people of Hell' raises unsettling theological and moral questions.What does it mean for a believer in Paradise to inherit individuals from Hell?Islamic theologians have struggled with this phrasing, as it seems incompatible with the nature of Paradise as a realm of purity and divine sanctity.Demonic Symbolism and Infernal InheritanceThe phrase'inheritance from the people of Hell'implicitly aligns these seventy entities with the infernal domain. In classical demonology, especially in Jewish and Christian traditions,demons were believed to inhabit Sheol (Hell) and were associated with sexual perversion, deception, and torment(cf.1 Enoch 15–16; Luke 8:30). The imagery of seventy beings, sexually available and sourced from Hell, suggests not a divine reward but aninfernal entrapment.Historically, the numberseventy-twohas mystical and demonic connotations. The medieval\"Lemegeton\" (The Lesser Key of Solomon), a grimoire of demonology, lists72 demons of the Ars Goetia, commanding legions of infernal spirits. Though predating Islamic tradition, this conceptual parallel is striking. It raises the speculative yet theologically pertinent question:Could Muhammad’s promise of seventy infernal companions inadvertently echo ancient Near Eastern demonology?Comparative Eschatology: The Bible vs. the HadithTheBiblical concept of the afterlifeoffers a stark contrast. InRevelation 21:4, Heaven is a realm where“there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain.”It lacks any description of carnal indulgences.Matthew 22:30explicitly states that“in the resurrection, people will neither marry nor be given in marriage, but will be like the angels in heaven.”This divergence reflects two fundamentally opposed theological anthropologies:The Islamic Hadith modelthat envisions Paradise as a place of corporeal and sensual gratification, even involving entities sourced from Hell.The Judeo-Christian modelthat conceives of the afterlife as a spiritual, incorruptible existence devoid of sexual desire or infernal influences.Moral and Theological ImplicationsThe idea of rewarding pious men with beings from Hell presents profound moral contradictions. If the inhabitants of Hell are condemned for their sins, how can they be elevated to reward the righteous? Furthermore, the text’s emphasis on perpetual male potency and sexual servitude objectifies these entities, reducing Paradise to a carnal fantasy rather than a realm of divine communion.From atheological anthropologyperspective, this reflects an anthropocentric, male-dominated eschatology inconsistent with monotheistic purity. The claim that such beings could inhabit Paradise undermines the very notion of Heaven as sanctified and untainted by sin.ConclusionThis analysis concludes that the promise recorded inSunan Ibn Majah 4337reflects not a divine revelation but a syncretic infusion ofpre-Islamic erotic mythology and demonological motifs. The figure of seventy infernal companions may symbolically correspond to ancient traditions of sexual demons and infernal spirits masquerading as houris.As such, theprophetic 'gift' attributed to Muhammad here appears less a reward from the One True God and more a lure rooted in the sensual and infernal imagination of Late Antiquity.For Christian scholars and interfaith theologians, this Hadith exemplifies the anthropomorphic tendencies of early Islamic eschatology and its occasional alignment with pagan, rather than Abrahamic, spiritual constructs.ReferencesSunan Ibn Majah 4337.In-book reference: Book 37, Hadith 238.

A Qur’anic and Theological AnalysisAuthor:Dr. Maxwell ShimbaAffiliation:Shimba Theological Institute & Max Shimba Ministries OrgAbstract:Muslim apologists often claim that Jesus Christ was sent only to the Jews, frequently citing Matthew 15:24 as evidence. However, a deeper examination of the Qur’an suggests that Muhammad’s mission was similarly limited—to the Arabs. This article offers a Qur’anic and theological exploration of ten key reasons derived from Islamic scripture to support the argument that Muhammad was a prophet specifically sent to the Arab people.IntroductionMuslims often assert that Jesus’ mission was restricted to the Jews, using Matthew 15:24:“I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel.”However, they seldom apply the same standard to Muhammad. A critical reading of the Qur’an reveals that Muhammad’s prophetic mission was confined to the Arabs. The Qur’an itself repeatedly emphasizes the cultural, linguistic, and geographic specificity of Muhammad’s mission. This paper presents ten Qur’anic reasons that substantiate this claim, structured for scholarly evaluation.1. Every Nation Has Its Own MessengerQur’anic Reference:Surah Yunus (10:47)\"And for every nation is a messenger. So when their messenger comes, it will be judged between them in justice, and they will not be wronged.\"Analysis:The verse clearly affirms that each nation (umma) receives its own specific messenger. If \"every nation\" means distinct people groups such as Africans, Indians, and Europeans, then Muhammad, as an Arab, was the messenger to Arabs alone.2. Messengers Are Sent in the Language of Their PeopleQur’anic Reference:Surah Ibrahim (14:4)\"And We did not send any messenger except [speaking] in the language of his people to state clearly for them.\"Analysis:This verse reinforces the idea that a prophet must share the linguistic and cultural context of his audience. Muhammad spoke Arabic and belonged to the Arab community; hence, his message was directed to Arabs.3. Every Nation Had Its Own Warning MessengerQur’anic Reference:Surah An-Nahl (16:36)\"And We certainly sent into every nation a messenger, [saying], 'Worship Allah and avoid Taghut.'\"Analysis:If God sent a messenger to every nation, then logically, Muhammad’s mission is localized to his own nation—the Arabs. Each messenger has a specific audience.4. Different Nations Receive Different LawsQur’anic Reference:Surah Al-Ma’idah (5:48)\"To each of you We prescribed a law and a method. Had Allah willed, He would have made you one nation...\"Analysis:This passage demonstrates theological pluralism within Islamic scripture, suggesting divine intent to give each nation its own laws and religious path. Thus, Muhammad’s Sharia was for his own people.5. Muhammad Was Sent to Warn a Nation Previously UnwarnedQur’anic Reference:Surah As-Sajda (32:2–3)\"It is a revelation from the Lord of the worlds. So that you may warn a people whose forefathers were not warned, so they are heedless.\"Analysis:This verse implies that Muhammad was sent to the Arabs, who had not previously received a prophet or scripture. The phrase “a people whose forefathers were not warned” cannot apply to Jews or Christians but to pagan Arabs.6. Muhammad Was One Among Many Prophets Sent to Their Own PeoplesQur’anic Reference:Surah Ya-Sin (36:2–6)\"Indeed, you are among the messengers, on a straight path... to warn a people whose forefathers were not warned.\"Analysis:Again, Muhammad is grouped among those messengers each sent to their own nations. The term “people whose fathers were not warned” aligns with the historical condition of the pre-Islamic Arabs.7. Arabs Were Given a Revelation to Avoid ExcusesQur’anic Reference:Surah Al-An'am (6:156–157)\"Lest you say: ‘The Scripture was only sent down to two groups before us...’\"Analysis:This implies that the Arabs could not claim ignorance, since a scripture (Qur’an) was now revealed to them, just as previous revelations were given to Jews and Christians. The message is clearly demarcated by ethnicity and geography.8. The Qur’an Was Revealed in Arabic for the ArabsQur’anic Reference:Surah Ash-Shu'ara (26:192–199)\"And indeed, it is the revelation of the Lord of the worlds... in a clear Arabic language... Had We revealed it to a non-Arab and he recited it to them, they would not have believed.\"Analysis:The Qur’an’s Arabic nature and its rejection by others if delivered in a different language confirm its intended audience was Arabs.9. The Qur’an Was Meant for Makkah and Its SurroundingsQur’anic Reference:Surah Al-An’am (6:92)\"This is a blessed Book which We have revealed, confirming what was before it, so that you may warn the Mother of Cities and those around it.\"Analysis:“Makkah” (the Mother of Cities) and its environs are explicitly mentioned. This limits the scope of Muhammad’s mission geographically to the Arabian Peninsula.10. Revelation in Arabic for the People Around MakkahQur’anic Reference:Surah Ash-Shura (42:7)\"And thus We have revealed to you an Arabic Qur’an that you may warn the Mother of Cities and those around it.\"Analysis:This verse confirms that the warning was for Makkah and its vicinity. The use of the Arabic language further limits the message to the region and people who spoke Arabic.ConclusionAccording to Islamic scripture itself, Muhammad was a prophet specifically sent to the Arab people. The Qur’an emphasizes his linguistic, cultural, and geographical connection to Arabia. It acknowledges a pattern in which each nation is given its own prophet, language, and divine law. Therefore, just as Muslims claim Jesus was sent only to the Jews, the Qur’an confirms that Muhammad was sent only to the Arabs. Any attempt to universalize Muhammad's mission contradicts the Qur’an's own repeated assertions.Keywords:Muhammad, Qur’an, Arabs, Prophethood, Sharia, Arabic language, Islamic theology, religious pluralism, Quranic interpretation, messenger to every nationCite as:Shimba, Maxwell.Was Muhammad Sent Only to the Arabs?

Drawing from Islamic hadith literature, Quranic interpretation, and Christian scripture, the article questions the logical and theological coherence of Islamic doctrines. It raises serious theological, philosophical, and soteriological concerns about the character of Allah and the practices around his worship, especially as they relate to salvation, divine justice, and eschatology. The paper culminates in a gospel-centered call to truth and freedom through Jesus Christ as the only way to salvation, referencing John 8:31 and John 14:6.IntroductionMuslims often find themselves in a difficult position when attempting to theologically defend Allah, especially when critical questions arise regarding the logic and coherence of Islamic doctrine. When faced with robust Christian arguments grounded in scripture and reason, many resort to mockery, deflection, or emotional outbursts rather than rational engagement. This paper aims to examine these critical points academically, particularly highlighting hidden inconsistencies in Islamic theology which are often obscured by Islamic clergy from their congregations. As Christians committed to sharing the truth in love, we must educate our Muslim brothers and sisters so they may come to know the truth, which, as Jesus promised, will set them free (John 8:31–32).Section I: The Paradox of Salawat – Praying for MuhammadAccording to Islamic hadith:“Whoever performs the ‘Asr prayer on Friday and says before standing up: ‘O Allah, send prayers upon Muhammad, the illiterate prophet, and upon his followers, and grant them eternal peace eighty times,’ he will be forgiven eighty years of sins.”—Al-Sadiqu Al-Amin, Vol. 1-2, Hadith No. 347, p. 160.Critical Questions:Who is worthy of intercession: the believer or the prophet?Why does the prophet demand salutation and blessings from the believers?Where in the Bible do we find Jesus asking for believers to pray for Him?Unlike Muhammad, Jesus never asked for such prayers. Instead, He prayed for His followers and offered Himself as the intercessor (John 17:9–26; Romans 8:34). The Islamic requirement to bless a deceased prophet raises theological concerns regarding the completeness and divinity of Muhammad’s mission.Furthermore, the idea that praying for Muhammad results in the forgiveness of 80 years of sin opens the door for moral abuse. Could this doctrine be behind the motivation of some extremists who believe that martyrdom or obedience to Muhammad’s traditions will earn them unearned righteousness?Section II: The Shocking Hadith – Will Allah Enter Hell?A major theological challenge arises from the following hadith:“Hell will continue saying, ‘Is there any more?’ until the Lord of Glory puts His Foot in it. Then it will say, ‘Enough! Enough! By Your Glory!’ and it will draw itself together.”—Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 8, Hadith No. 654This anthropomorphic description, where Allah physically places His foot in Hell to pacify it, presents numerous theological problems:Divine Vulnerability:A god who physically interacts with hell seems susceptible to spatial-temporal limitations.Theological Dissonance:The Christian God is the eternal Judge, distinct and separate from Hell, and will cast Satan and death itself into the lake of fire (Revelation 20:14).Deceptive Imagery:If Allah can enter Hell or interact with it materially, is he really distinct from creation? Or is this a mischaracterization of divinity?Section III: The Final Judgment – The Biblical View of Hell and God's SovereigntyThe Bible makes a clear distinction between the Creator and created realities, including Hell. In Matthew 25:41, Jesus says:“Then He will say to those on His left, ‘Depart from Me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.’”This verse establishes:Hell was never made for God or humanity but for the Devil and fallen angels.God is the supreme Judge who sends the wicked into Hell, not a being who interacts with Hell to calm it down.Likewise, in Revelation 20:11–15, we are told:The dead will be judged before God.Anyone whose name is not found in the Book of Life will be thrown into the lake of fire.Death and Hades (not God) are thrown into the lake of fire.There is no indication that God (Yahweh) ever steps into Hell or interacts with it as if it were alive.Section IV: A Call to Truth – The Real Identity of GodFrom the biblical evidence, the God revealed in Scripture (Yahweh) is holy, righteous, omnipotent, and transcendent. He is not confined by the limitations or anthropomorphic depictions found in certain Islamic texts. In fact, the idea that “Allah” enters Hell contradicts the very nature of divine transcendence and omnipotence.It therefore raises the possibility that the Islamic depiction of Allah is a counterfeit, a false deity masquerading as divine. This aligns with what Jesus said about false prophets and deceptions in the last days (Matthew 24:24; 2 Corinthians 11:14).Section V: The Way to Salvation – Jesus Christ AloneJesus Christ declares in John 14:6:“I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.”And in Revelation 3:20:“Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and dine with him, and he with Me.”Dear Muslim reader, Jesus Christ is calling you today. He does not ask you to pray for Him but instead invites you into a relationship with Him, where He intercedes for you. He is the only one whose name is written in the Book of Life, and through Him alone can your name also be written therein (Revelation 20:15).Conclusion: Choose Life TodayTo all seekers of truth: reflect deeply on these theological discrepancies. Question what you have been taught. Don’t settle for incomplete or inconsistent doctrines. True salvation and eternal life are found only in Jesus Christ.“You shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.” –John 8:32ReferencesThe Holy Bible, New King James Version (NKJV)Sahih al-Bukhari(Volume 8, Hadith 654)Al-Sadiqu Al-Amin, Vol. 1-2, Hadith No. 347Quranic interpretations (as referenced by Muslim scholars)Revelation 20:11–15, Matthew 25:41, John 3:16, John 14:6, Revelation 3:20Dr. Maxwell ShimbaFounder, Shimba Theological InstituteMax Shimba Ministries Org",

The verse asserts that those who manifest arrogance, even while outwardly engaging in worship, are destined for hell. This paper explores the semantic, theological, and exegetical dimensions of the term \"proud\" (Arabic:yastakbirūna) within Quranic theology, comparing it to biblical and Judaic views on pride. Furthermore, it challenges common contemporary Islamic narratives that assure salvation for Muslims merely on the basis of religious identity, highlighting Quranic and Hadith-based evidence that ultimate judgment is contingent on inner humility and submission to divine will rather than nominal affiliation. The paper concludes by reflecting on the universal theological principle that pride remains a damning sin across Abrahamic faith traditions.1. IntroductionReligious eschatology across Abrahamic traditions consistently condemns pride as a fundamental sin leading to damnation. In Islam, Quran 40:60 offers a particularly severe warning against arrogance, linking it directly with the fate of hellfire, even for those who engage in acts of worship. This text raises significant theological questions regarding the criteria for salvation in Islamic doctrine. Are professing Muslims exempt from condemnation due to their religious identity, or does the presence of pride negate the value of their worship and faith? This paper investigates these issues through an exegetical analysis of Quran 40:60 within its linguistic, contextual, and theological frameworks.2. Textual Analysis and TranslationThe verse in question, Quran 40:60, is rendered in several English translations as follows:“And your Lord says: ‘Call upon Me, and I will answer you. Indeed, those who are too proud to worship Me will enter Hell [rendered] humiliated.’”(Sahih International)In Arabic:وَقَالَ رَبُّكُمُ ادْعُونِي أَسْتَجِبْ لَكُمْ ۚ إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ عَنْ عِبَادَتِي سَيَدْخُلُونَ جَهَنَّمَ دَاخِرِينَKey terms for analysis:يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ (yastakbirūna): Those who act arrogantly, proudly, exalting themselves above.عِبَادَتِي (‘ibādatī): My worship, service, obedience.دَاخِرِينَ (dākhirīn): Abased, humiliated, in disgrace.The syntax unambiguously links arrogance with refusal or distortion of true worship, regardless of religious label or ritual participation.3. Exegetical and Theological InterpretationClassical exegetes like Ibn Kathir, Al-Qurtubi, and Al-Tabari concur thatyastakbirūna ‘an ‘ibādatīrefers to those whose arrogance prevents them from sincerely invoking and submitting to Allah. Notably, arrogance (kibr) is considered a severe inner sin, often hidden under external religiosity. Al-Ghazali inIhya Ulum al-Dinclassifies arrogance as an internal disease of the heart that invalidates acts of worship before God.Thus, a Muslim who outwardly prays, fasts, and performs rituals, but inwardly exalts themselves in pride, falls under this condemnation. This challenges popular Islamic soteriological claims that mere identity guarantees divine favor, and aligns with Quranic passages such as 4:123:“Paradise is not (obtained) by your wishful thinking nor by that of the People of the Scripture. Whoever does a wrong will be recompensed for it.”4. Comparative Theological ContextIn biblical theology, pride is also consistently condemned. Proverbs 16:18 declares:“Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.”Similarly, James 4:6 in the New Testament teaches:“God opposes the proud but shows favor to the humble.”Judaism’s Talmudic tradition (Avot 4:4) warns:“Be very, very humble, for the hope of man is the worm.”Thus, across Abrahamic faiths, pride acts as a moral and spiritual separator between man and God, leading to eschatological ruin.5. Implications for MuslimsQuran 40:60 stands as an unequivocal statement that no external religious affiliation immunizes one from hell if inner pride corrupts the heart. The verse demands that Muslims critically self-examine their spiritual posture, prioritizing humility over outward religiosity.It serves as a polemic against Islamic triumphalism — the presumption that Muslims are categorically destined for paradise. Muhammad himself warned:“No one who has an atom’s weight of pride in his heart will enter Paradise.”(Sahih Muslim 91)This authentic Hadith corroborates the Quranic position that pride is a salvific disqualifier.6. ConclusionQuran 40:60 profoundly asserts that pride nullifies worship and merits hellfire, regardless of one’s religious identity. This principle resonates with parallel teachings in biblical and Judaic theology, reaffirming the universal danger of arrogance before God. The verse demands a theology of humility, challenging both Muslims and adherents of other faiths to forsake spiritual pride and embrace sincere submission to the Creator. It refutes popularized Islamic exclusivism that assumes salvation based on mere confession without internal transformation.This analysis demonstrates that — according to the Quran itself — proud Muslims, like any other proud individual, are destined for hell unless redeemed by humility and repentance. It calls for honest interfaith dialogue on the nature of pride, worship, and divine judgment.ReferencesThe Quran (40:60; 4:123; 16:23)Sahih Muslim, Hadith 91Al-Ghazali,Ihya Ulum al-DinIbn Kathir,Tafsir al-Qur'an al-AzimAl-Tabari,Jami’ al-BayanAl-Qurtubi,Tafsir al-Jami' li-Ahkam al-Qur'anProverbs 16:18, Holy BibleJames 4:6, Holy BibleTalmud Bavli, Avot 4:4",

    "full_content": "The Relationship Between Muhammad and Khadija: Historical, Social, and Personal DynamicsBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba | Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis paper critically examines the early marital relationship between Muhammad and Khadija bint Khuwaylid within the context of 7th-century Arabian society. Using classical Islamic sources and historical reports, this study explores the circumstances that led to their marriage, the underlying personal and social motivations, and how these dynamics influenced Muhammad’s later marital decisions. Questions are raised regarding the sincerity of Muhammad’s affection toward Khadija, his interest in her wealth, and his post-Khadija marital behavior. The analysis also addresses whether Muhammad's later choices reflected earlier suppressed desires and whether his marriage to Khadija was driven more by circumstance than romantic conviction.IntroductionThe marriage between Muhammad, later the founder of Islam, and Khadija bint Khuwaylid has often been presented in Islamic tradition as a union of mutual respect and affection. However, closer textual and contextual scrutiny suggests nuanced socio-economic and personal motivations behind this relationship. Khadija, a wealthy merchant widow significantly older than Muhammad, proposed marriage to him under circumstances revealing both her admiration for his character and the societal challenges posed by her status as an aging, twice-widowed woman.This study presents a reconstructed narrative based on traditional Islamic historiography and hadith literature and then critically examines its implications.Narrative Account: Khadija's Proposal to MuhammadKhadija, described in this narrative as an elderly woman without teeth, wrestled internally with the thought:“Could Muhammad possibly agree to marry me?”After extensive deliberation, she resolved to convey her feelings to Muhammad. Despite considering the matter a fanciful dream, she acknowledged its feasibility, though she was troubled by doubts:\"Who could deliver my proposal? Would Muhammad, in his youth, accept an elderly woman like me?\"At that moment, a knock came at the door. It was her sister, Halah, who greeted her warmly. Halah, upon being welcomed, revealed she had experienced a disturbing dream where Khadija wandered in darkness, guided by a voice urging her forward. This prompted her visit to inquire about Khadija's well-being.Khadija admitted:\"To be honest, I have been consumed by thoughts of Muhammad, pondering his virtues and character unmatched among the Quraysh.\"Halah encouraged her:\"Then propose to him.\"But Khadija confessed her fears:\"I’m afraid he might reject me because of my age. I have been married twice, and he is a young man of twenty-five, yet to marry. How could he accept a woman as old as his mother, with children of her own?\"Halah advised:\"Who first introduced Muhammad to you for business?\"Khadija answered:\"My friend Nafisa.\"Halah responded:\"Then Nafisa should deliver your proposal.\"Thus, the groundwork for the marriage was set.Muhammad’s Social Position and Personal ConsiderationsAt the time, Muhammad was an orphan of modest means, having lived with various relatives throughout his youth. Life offered him little stability. From this position of social uncertainty, marriage to a wealthy, respected woman like Khadija presented an invaluable opportunity for security and social elevation.Textual Evidence: Muhammad’s Preference for Younger WivesA revealing passage fromSahih al-Bukhari, Volume 3, Book 34, Hadith 310offers insight into Muhammad’s personal inclinations. On one occasion, he asked Jarir ibn Abdullah:\"Have you married?\"Jarir replied affirmatively.Muhammad then asked:\"A virgin or a matron?\"Jarir responded:\"A matron.\"Muhammad remarked:\"Why didn’t you marry a virgin so that you may play with her and she with you?\"This explicit preference suggests that Muhammad may have favored younger brides, who would offer companionship and lighthearted interaction, raising questions about his emotional investment in Khadija.Analytical Questions and Critical ReflectionsBased on this narrative and supporting textual evidence, several critical inquiries emerge:Did Muhammad Truly Love Khadija?The text implies that Muhammad’s acceptance of Khadija’s proposal was driven more by socio-economic necessity than romantic affection. The hadith regarding his preference for virgins further suggests that his emotional fulfillment may not have been fully met in this marriage.Was Muhammad Primarily Attracted to Khadija’s Wealth?Khadija was a prominent businesswoman of Mecca. Her wealth and status offered Muhammad financial security, business opportunities, and social standing — factors arguably contributing to his consent.Did Muhammad Orchestrate Khadija’s Death to Pursue His Desires?While no historical record directly accuses Muhammad of causing Khadija’s death, the timing of his subsequent marriages, particularly to much younger brides like Aisha, raises speculative questions about suppressed desires and motivations possibly deferred during Khadija’s lifetime.Why Did Muhammad Marry Multiple Wives Only After Khadija’s Death?The immediate proliferation of marital unions following Khadija’s death might suggest that Muhammad, restrained during her lifetime — perhaps out of obligation or respect — seized the opportunity for personal freedom upon her passing.ConclusionThis critical examination of Muhammad’s marriage to Khadija, viewed through the lenses of socio-economic realities, personal desires, and textual evidence, reveals a complex interplay of duty, opportunity, and suppressed inclination. While Islamic tradition venerates this marriage as one of loyalty and partnership, historical scrutiny suggests it may have been more circumstantial than affection-driven. Muhammad’s later marital behavior, including his explicit preference for younger brides, reinforces the notion that his union with Khadija may not have aligned with his deeper personal desires.ReferencesSahih al-Bukhari, Volume 3, Book 34, Hadith 310.Ibn Ishaq.Sirat Rasul Allah(The Life of Muhammad), trans.

    "full_content": "Title:Who Introduced Islam? An Analytical Review of Islamic and Christian Historical ClaimsBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba | Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractA longstanding debate persists between Muslim and Christian communities regarding the origin of Islam. Muslims claim that Islam existed since the creation of the universe, practiced by all prophets from Adam to Muhammad. Conversely, Christians argue that Islam emerged four thousand years after Jesus Christ, with Muhammad as its founder. This paper examines Islamic sources—including the Qur’an, Sahih al-Bukhari, Sahih Muslim, and respected biographical literature on Muhammad—to determine whether Islam predates Muhammad or whether it was instituted by him in the 7th century. The study concludes by posing a reflective theological question on who truly became the first Muslim between Muhammad and his wife Khadija, based on documented Islamic traditions.IntroductionFor centuries, Islamic and Christian communities have debated the historical and theological origins of Islam. On one side, Muslim scholarship maintains that Islam is an eternal religion instituted by God since the creation of Adam, upheld by every prophet that followed. On the other hand, Christian theologians and historians contest this claim, asserting that Islam was established in the 7th century CE by Muhammad in Arabia. This study seeks to clarify these claims by analyzing both the Qur’anic texts and early Islamic historical records, focusing on the formation of Islam as an organized religious system and identifying its earliest adherents.Textual Analysis from Islamic SourcesTo ascertain the veracity of these claims, we turn first to the Qur’an and its exegesis. In the interpretation of Surah Yusuf (12:19–20) as found in the Kiswahili edition of the Qur’an (third edition, Juzuu 12, page 311), the commentary acknowledges that over 4000 years elapsed before the arrival of the religion brought by Prophet Muhammad. This indicates, within certain Islamic commentaries, that Islam, as an institutionalized religion, was introduced by Muhammad himself.Additionally, canonical hadith collections such asSahih al-BukhariandSahih Muslim, along with various writings by eminent Islamic scholars, affirm this understanding. A critical example is drawn from the biographical textMaisha ya Nabii Muhammad (Life of Prophet Muhammad)by the late Sheikh Abdullah Saleh Al-Farsy, the former Chief Kadhi of Zanzibar and later Kenya.On page 18 of this text, it is recorded that upon receiving his first revelation, Muhammad returned home and confided in his wife, Khadija bint Khuwaylid. She immediately believed in him, thereby becoming the first person to profess the Shahada (Islamic declaration of faith). The text explicitly states:\"She was the very first Muslim.\"The same book lists the earliest Muslims chronologically as follows:Khadija bint Khuwaylid— First person to embrace Islam upon Muhammad’s invitation.Ali ibn Abi Talib— Muhammad’s cousin, who initially hesitated but later declared his faith.Zayd ibn Haritha— Muhammad’s adopted son.Baraka bint Tha'laba (Umm Ayman)— Muhammad’s nursemaid.The historical record situates the formal beginning of Islam as a religious movement onMonday, the 17th of Ramadan, equivalent to27th December, 610 CE. Prior to this date, there existed no structured religious system identified as Islam.Historical and Theological ImplicationGiven these Islamic sources, it becomes clear that institutional Islam—characterized by specific rituals, beliefs, and the Shahada—originated with Muhammad. While Islamic theology retrospectively projects Islam onto earlier prophets, the organized practice labeled as Islam began in the 7th century.This reality prompts a reflective theological question:Who was truly the first Muslim—Muhammad or his wife Khadija?If Khadija accepted Islam the moment Muhammad shared his experience and professed the Shahada before him, then logically, based on Islamic tradition itself, Khadija would hold the distinction of being the first Muslim.ConclusionThis analysis reveals that, according to documented Islamic sources, the structured religion of Islam as it is known today was introduced by Prophet Muhammad in the 7th century CE. While Islamic theology maintains a belief in Islam’s primordial existence through earlier prophets, the practical and communal establishment of the faith began during Muhammad’s lifetime.The evidence further suggests that Khadija bint Khuwaylid was, by Islamic historical accounts, the first individual to accept Islam, even before Muhammad publicly proclaimed it to others. This raises a profound theological reflection within Islamic history about the origins of faith adherence in the early Muslim community.Keywords:Islamic history, Prophet Muhammad, Khadija bint Khuwaylid, Islam origin, Islamic theology, early Muslim converts, Qur’an, Sahih al-Bukhari, Abdullah Saleh Al-Farsy, 610 CE, religious origins, Islamic tradition.",

    "full_content": "Title:A Critical Theological and Historical Examination of Islamic Claims to Abrahamic Origins and the Primacy of the KaabaBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba | Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractIslamic tradition asserts that Islam is the original faith of the Prophet Abraham and that the Kaaba in Mecca is the first house of worship appointed for humanity. These claims, derived predominantly from the Qur'an and Islamic exegesis, are foundational to Muslim identity and belief. However, a critical examination of available historical, biblical, and theological records reveals significant inconsistencies and evidentiary gaps. This paper interrogates three core Islamic assertions: (1) that Islam was the religion of Abraham, (2) that the Kaaba was the first house of worship for humankind, and (3) that Muhammad was a true prophet of God in continuity with the biblical prophets. The study draws upon scriptural, historical, and logical critique to evaluate these claims, proposing that Islam's historical narrative concerning Abrahamic tradition is a constructed apologetic rather than a verifiable historical continuum.IntroductionIslam’s theological framework rests upon its asserted continuity with Abrahamic monotheism. The Qur'an frequently invokes Abraham (Ibrahim) as a monotheistic patriarch who predates Judaism and Christianity, claiming Islam to be the restoration of his original faith. Moreover, it attributes primordial religious significance to the Kaaba, declaring it the first house of worship appointed for mankind (Qur'an 3:96). These assertions, however, invite critical scrutiny, particularly regarding the absence of corroborating records predating the 7th century CE. This article rigorously examines these foundational claims through theological, scriptural, and historical lenses.I. Was Islam the Religion of Abraham?A. Absence of Historical Records Confirming Islamic Practice by AbrahamThe Qur'an claims inQur'an 3:95that Abraham followed the same religion as later Muslims, though neither the Hebrew Bible nor any pre-Islamic historical source records Abraham professing the Shahada, performing Salah, paying Zakat, fasting Ramadan, or making pilgrimage (Hajj) to the Kaaba. These are essential Islamic practices, yet no documentation exists in Jewish, Christian, or independent historical archives demonstrating Abraham's observance of these rites.Questions posed:Where are historical records verifying Islam as Abraham's religion?Where did Abraham declare Shahada or practice the five pillars of Islam?No credible pre-Qur'anic source substantiates these practices.B. Abraham's Descendants and the Absence of Islamic PracticeAbraham fathered eight sons: Ishmael, Isaac, Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah (Genesis 25:1-6). None are recorded in biblical, historical, or extra-biblical literature as practitioners of Islam. Notably:Israelite priesthood was established through the tribe of Levi, not through an Islamic framework (Exodus 28:1-3).Neither Ishmaelites nor Israelites practiced Shahada, Salah, Zakat, Ramadan fasting, or Hajj to Mecca.C. The Prophetic Lineage and Absence of Islamic RitualsFrom Adam, Noah, and Enoch to Jesus Christ, no record exists of Islamic practices among these figures. The consistent religious expression recorded in Hebrew Scriptures involves animal sacrifices, altar-building, and temple worship — all absent from Islamic ritual forms until their later codification by Muhammad.II. Is the Kaaba the First House of Worship for Humanity?A. Absence of Biblical or Historical Visits to the KaabaAccording toQur'an 3:96, the Kaaba is \"the first house of worship for mankind.\" Yet no biblical prophet, including Adam, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, David, Solomon, or Jesus, is recorded to have visited, worshipped at, or acknowledged the Kaaba.The Israelites, after leaving Egypt, constructed the Tabernacle at Mount Sinai as instructed by Yahweh (Exodus 25–27).God later commanded Solomon to build a temple in Jerusalem, not a pilgrimage to Mecca (1 Kings 6).Questions posed:Why did God never command Moses or Israel to worship at the Kaaba?Why is the Kaaba absent from all Hebrew and Christian canonical writings if it were of primordial significance?B. Israelite Worship CentersFrom the Tabernacle to Solomon’s Temple, biblical theology centered on Jerusalem, not Mecca. No command exists in Old Testament scriptures for Israelites to face or journey toward Mecca. This contradicts Islam’s claim of the Kaaba's primacy.III. Is Muhammad a True Prophet in Continuity with Biblical Prophets?A. Muhammad’s Pagan Origins and the Black StoneMuhammad was born into a polytheistic Quraysh society, which housed 360 idols at the Kaaba. Prior to Islam’s founding, he participated in the installation of the Black Stone in the Kaaba’s eastern corner (circa 605 CE). Even after Islam’s conquest of Mecca, Muhammad preserved the Black Stone, a relic of pre-Islamic Arabian paganism, contradicting biblical monotheism’s rejection of idolatrous objects (Deuteronomy 4:16-19).Questions posed:Why did Muhammad retain the Black Stone if Islam was pure monotheism?Why did no biblical prophet bow to or venerate a stone object?B. Theological Inconsistencies in Muhammad’s ClaimsInQur'an 6:76-78, Abraham momentarily recognizes a star, the moon, and the sun as possible deities before rejecting them. This depiction diverges from the biblical Abraham who, from the outset, recognizes the singular Yahweh (Genesis 12:1-8).The Qur'anic portrayal inadvertently paints Abraham as a temporary pagan — a theological flaw given Islam’s assertion that he was a pure monotheist from the beginning.Observation:If Abraham’s initial recognition of celestial objects as lords is polytheistic, how does Islam maintain that he was never a pagan, perQur'an 3:95?ConclusionA thorough historical-theological analysis reveals substantial evidentiary gaps and theological inconsistencies in Islam's claim to Abrahamic continuity. Neither Jewish nor Christian scriptures — nor any credible historical source — affirm that Abraham practiced Islam or that the Kaaba was the first house of worship. Furthermore, Muhammad’s personal history, his handling of pagan relics like the Black Stone, and his retroactive theological claims raise legitimate doubts about the authenticity of his prophetic office in the biblical tradition.Final Thought:Without external, pre-Islamic corroboration of Islam’s Abrahamic origins or the Kaaba’s primordial status, the Qur’anic narrative appears as a post hoc construct designed to grant theological legitimacy to Islam by appropriating Jewish and Christian figures and narratives. This, combined with Muhammad’s socio-religious context and theological divergences, positions Islam not as a restoration but as a reinterpretation and revision of Abrahamic monotheism.ReferencesThe Holy Bible (Genesis 12–25; Exodus 25–40; 1 Kings 6)The Qur'an (Surah 3:95-96; 6:75-79)Ibn Ishaq,Sirat Rasul AllahWatt, W.

    "full_content": "Who Is the Allah of Muhammad? A Theological and Ethical Analysis of Muhammad’s Relation to the Ten CommandmentsBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis article critically examines the identity of Allah as introduced by Muhammad in early Islam, in comparison to the God of Israel (YHWH) as revealed in the Hebrew Bible. It investigates whether Muhammad, as claimed by Muslims, was a prophet of the same God who sent Moses, or whether he invented a new deity and religious system that violated the foundational moral and spiritual laws revealed in the Ten Commandments. By analyzing Muhammad’s actions and teachings against the Decalogue, this study reveals significant theological and moral discrepancies between biblical prophetic standards and Muhammad’s life and practices.1. IntroductionIslamic theology posits Muhammad as the final prophet in a lineage that includes Moses, David, and Jesus, sent by Allah — a deity Muslims claim is the same as the God of the Bible. This assertion merits critical examination against the ethical and theological framework established in the Torah, specifically the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20:1–17). If Muhammad indeed operated under the authority of the God of Israel, his life and religious reforms should conform to the moral laws previously revealed. This study will analyze Muhammad’s actions against each commandment to assess these claims.2. The Ten Commandments and Muhammad: A Comparative Ethical Review2.1. The First Commandment“You shall have no other gods before Me.” (Exodus 20:3)Historical sources (Quran 27:91; Sahih al-Bukhari; Musnad Ahmad Hadith 2506) indicate that Muhammad’s early association with the Kaaba, which housed 360 idols, including the chief idolHubal, contradicts this commandment. Even after Islam’s emergence, the Black Stone (Hajar al-Aswad) remained an object of veneration (cf. Sahih al-Bukhari, Book 25). Unlike biblical prophets who worshipped YHWH exclusively, Muhammad’s theological innovations centered around a deity identified with pre-Islamic Arabian idolatry, contradicting monotheistic fidelity.2.2. The Second Commandment“You shall not make for yourself a carved image…” (Exodus 20:4)The erection and ritual veneration of the Black Stone at the eastern corner of the Kaaba violate this law. Islamic sources affirm Muhammad’s reverence for the Black Stone (Sahih al-Bukhari 2:667), a practice alien to biblical prophetic tradition. The Kaaba itself was a shrine for numerous idols before Islam, and the Black Stone remained a focal point of worship post-Islam.2.3. The Third Commandment“You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain.” (Exodus 20:7)By attributing divine authority to the deityAllah, whom he redefined from Arabian pagan tradition, Muhammad’s claim that this being was the God of Moses constitutes a theological misrepresentation. The Quran (e.g., 27:91) and Hadith sources demonstrate a theological divergence from YHWH, particularly in moral character and covenantal promises.2.4. The Fourth Commandment“Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.” (Exodus 20:8-11)The Quran and Hadith are devoid of any observance of the biblical Sabbath by Muhammad. Instead, he instituted Friday (Jumu'ah) prayers (Sahih al-Bukhari, Book 13), severing continuity with the Mosaic Law. Moreover, Islamic records do not document Muhammad honoring his mother Amina or his foster-father, an essential moral expectation within the Decalogue.2.5. The Fifth Commandment“Honor your father and your mother.” (Exodus 20:12)Historical accounts and Hadith literature record no explicit narrative of Muhammad honoring his deceased parents in a biblically consistent manner. This commandment, deeply embedded in Hebrew tradition and culture, appears neglected in the Prophet’s documented personal ethics.2.6. The Sixth Commandment“You shall not murder.” (Exodus 20:13)Islamic texts report multiple sanctioned killings under Muhammad’s command (Sunan Abu Dawud 2665; Quran 33:26-27), including executions of Jews in Medina (Banu Qurayza tribe) and assassinations of critics and poets. These actions starkly contrast with biblical prophetic conduct, where human life was sanctified and murder condemned.2.7. The Seventh Commandment“You shall not commit adultery.” (Exodus 20:14)Muhammad’s marital history includes multiple wives and concubines, alongside reported relationships with captive women post-battle (Sahih al-Bukhari, Book 62). The Quran itself (33:37) records the incident involving Zaynab, the wife of his adopted son Zayd, which led to divine approval for their marriage after Zayd’s divorce — a case of moral compromise by biblical standards.2.8. The Eighth Commandment“You shall not steal.” (Exodus 20:15)Raids on merchant caravans (e.g., the Nakhla raid) and the confiscation of property from Jewish tribes in Medina (Quran 33:27) contradict this commandment. These actions were justified as spoils of war but violate the biblical prohibition against theft.2.9. The Ninth Commandment“You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.” (Exodus 20:16)The Quran and Hadith record accusations against Jews, Christians, and earlier prophets, including claims inconsistent with biblical revelation. Muhammad’s re-narration of biblical history (e.g., the altered portrayal of Ishmael’s role in Abraham’s story) constitutes false testimony by Judeo-Christian canonical standards.2.10. The Tenth Commandment“You shall not covet…” (Exodus 20:17)The incident involving Muhammad’s desire for Zaynab (Quran 33:37) illustrates a direct breach of this commandment. His subsequent marriage to her, following her divorce from Zayd, signifies covetous behavior incompatible with prophetic holiness as modeled in the Hebrew Scriptures.3. ConclusionThe ethical and theological review presented herein evidences Muhammad’s consistent violations of the Ten Commandments as revealed through Moses. These findings challenge the Islamic assertion that Muhammad was a prophet in the same spiritual and moral lineage as Moses, David, and Jesus. Furthermore, this analysis raises critical questions about the origin and identity of Allah as worshipped in Islam, revealing significant divergences from YHWH, the God of Israel.Before Muslims challenge the integrity of the Bible, Christianity, or the Apostle Paul, it is imperative they first account for these fundamental ethical transgressions by Muhammad against the immutable moral law of the Decalogue.ReferencesThe Holy Bible, Exodus 20:1–17The Quran (various verses)Sahih al-Bukhari (multiple volumes)Sunan Abu Dawud, Hadith 2665Musnad Ahmad, Hadith 2506Ibn Ishaq’sSirat Rasul AllahAl-Tabari’sTarikh al-Rusul wa’l-Muluk",

    "full_content": "What Is Islam? A Critical Theological and Historical Analysis of Islam’s Origins and ClaimsBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba | Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis paper critically examines the theological claims of Islam as formulated by Muhammad, interrogating the Qur'anic, Hadithic, and historical evidences that Muslims often cite to authenticate their religion. It argues that the foundational constructs of Islam, including the identity of Allah, the authenticity of the Qur'an, the role of Jibril (Gabriel), and the prophetic status of Muhammad, are inventions rooted in Arabian paganism and distorted Judeo-Christian narratives. The study employs a comparative theological approach by juxtaposing Qur'anic claims with biblical scriptures, especially in examining Qur'an 48:29’s assertion of foreheads marked by prostration in the Law (Taurat) and Gospel (Injeel). The paper concludes by affirming the messianic work of Jesus Christ as prophesied in Isaiah 53, offering salvation in contrast to the theological constructs of Islam.IntroductionIslam, professed by over a billion adherents globally, claims divine origin through revelations allegedly given by Allah to Muhammad via the angel Jibril (Gabriel). Central to Islamic theology is the belief that Muhammad is the final prophet, the Qur'an is the literal word of God, and the Kaaba in Mecca is the holiest site ordained by divine decree. However, a closer examination of Islamic primary sources—specifically the Qur'an, Hadith collections, and early Islamic historiography—reveals significant theological, historical, and logical inconsistencies. This paper contends that Islam is a syncretic religion shaped by pre-Islamic Arabian paganism and borrowed Judeo-Christian elements, packaged under the authority of Muhammad.1. The Claim of Islam’s Divine Origin: An Internal ContradictionThe Qur'an claims that \"the religion before Allah is Islam\" (Qur'an 3:19), asserting Islam as the primordial faith of humanity. However, historical scrutiny reveals that the termIslamin the sense of a structured religion emerged only through Muhammad’s prophetic claims in 7th-century Arabia. The invocation of earlier scriptural communities (People of the Book) as having rejected Islam out of envy presupposes the prior existence of Islam, which no historical or biblical evidence substantiates.Qur'an 3:19\"The religion before Allah is Islam. Nor did the People of the Book refuse it except through envy, after knowledge had come to them.\"This suggests an anachronism, as neither Judaic nor Christian texts reference \"Islam\" as a divinely instituted faith preceding Muhammad.2. The Invention of Allah and the Idol of HubalPre-Islamic Mecca housed a pantheon of idols at the Kaaba, including the chief deity Hubal. Historical and archaeological evidence identifies Allah as a high god among Arabian deities, associated with the Moon. The Qur'an inadvertently preserves this legacy inQur'an 38:5–7, where critics of Muhammad accuse him of consolidating various gods into one:Qur'an 38:5–7\"Has he made the gods [only] one Allah? Indeed, this is a curious thing.\"The passage confirms the existence of polytheistic worship before Islam, contradicting the Qur'an's later monotheistic claims.3. The Fabrication of Jibril (Gabriel)The Qur'an frequently mentions Jibril as the angelic intermediary delivering Allah’s revelations to Muhammad (e.g.,Qur'an 2:97). However, the biblical Gabriel serves as a messenger to Daniel and Mary, never associated with delivering scripture. Muhammad’s Jibril is a reappropriation of Judeo-Christian angelology.Qur'an 2:97\"Whoever is an enemy to Jibril—it is [none but] he who has brought it [the Qur'an] down upon your heart by permission of Allah...\"This divergence points to a manufactured narrative, borrowing the name Gabriel to authenticate Muhammad’s revelations.4. The Qur'an’s Borrowing from Biblical TextsEarly Islamic historiography acknowledges that Muhammad was influenced by Waraqa ibn Nawfal, a Christian monk who allegedly taught him biblical stories.Qur'an 16:102–103admits accusations that a human source instructed Muhammad:Qur'an 16:103\"We know that they say, 'It is only a human being who teaches him.' The tongue of the one they refer to is foreign, yet this [Qur'an] is in clear Arabic language.\"Despite claiming divine origin, the Qur'an’s content reflects distorted and recontextualized biblical narratives.5. Muhammad’s Self-Investiture as ProphetInQur'an 48:29, Muhammad declares himself the Apostle of Allah, describing his followers as marked by their prostrations—a claim said to find precedent in the Torah and Gospel.Qur'an 48:29\"Muhammad is the Apostle of Allah, and those with him are severe against disbelievers, and merciful among themselves. You see them bowing and prostrating, seeking bounty from Allah... Their mark is on their faces from the traces of prostration. That is their likeness in the Torah and their likeness in the Gospel...\"This claim demands biblical evidence:Question 1:Where is the evidence in the Old Testament (Torah) that people have a mark on their foreheads from prostration?Answer: No Old Testament passage supports this. Marks in the Old Testament (e.g.,Ezekiel 9:4) signify divine protection from judgment, not physical traces from prayer.Question 2:Where is the evidence in the New Testament (Gospel) of such a mark?Answer: No New Testament passage attributes physical marks on foreheads from prayer. The Book of Revelation (7:3, 14:1) speaks of a symbolic seal of God on the foreheads of the righteous but unrelated to physical prostration marks.Question 3:If Muslims argue the Taurat and Injil are separate from the Bible, where are these texts?Answer: No independent, authenticated pre-Islamic texts titled \"Taurat\" and \"Injil\" exist outside the Bible. Islam itself acknowledges the Torah as revealed to Moses and the Gospel to Jesus, corresponding to the Old and New Testaments.6. Theological Synthesis: Muhammad as Allah, Jibril, and the Qur'anic AuthorIslamic narratives blur the distinction between Muhammad, Jibril, and Allah. Given Muhammad's exclusive claim to receive revelation through Jibril—whom no one else witnessed—the possibility arises of a constructed religious system where Muhammad functioned as prophet, angel, and deity figurehead.Further,Sahih al-Bukhari 5:58:206describes pre-Islamic Mecca’s idol worship centered around the Kaaba’s 360 idols, including the Black Stone—a practice Islam continues by venerating the Kaaba, which originally housed idols.7. Christ’s Redemptive Work: The Biblical AlternativeIn stark contrast, the Bible proclaims Jesus Christ as the divine Son of God, whose atoning death and resurrection fulfill the prophecy ofIsaiah 53:1–12. Unlike Muhammad’s militaristic and legalistic theology, Christ offers grace and salvation:Isaiah 53:5\"But he was wounded for our transgressions, bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes, we are healed.\"This Messianic prophecy underscores Christianity's emphasis on redemption through divine self-sacrifice rather than human works.ConclusionThis study demonstrates that Islam's theological foundation is rooted in pre-Islamic paganism, biblical distortions, and Muhammad's self-serving claims. It exposes the inconsistencies between Qur'anic assertions and both historical fact and biblical revelation. The paper calls readers to reconsider Islam’s claims in light of scriptural evidence and embrace the redemptive work of Jesus Christ as the only path to salvation.ReferencesQur'an 3:19; 38:5–7; 2:97; 16:102–103; 48:29Sahih al-Bukhari 5:58:206Holy Bible: Isaiah 53:1–12; Ezekiel 9:4; Revelation 7:3; 14:1",

Through a close exegetical analysis of the Qur'anic text, supported by classical Islamic commentaries and historical records, the paper demonstrates that the Qur'an recognizes the Jewish people's ancestral and divine claim to the Land of Israel. Furthermore, this study reveals that the termPalestinenever appears in the Qur'an, nor was such a political entity or ethno-national identity recognized during the time of Muhammad. This analysis corrects prevalent misconceptions and offers a scripturally grounded perspective on the issue of Israel’s legitimacy within Islamic thought.1. IntroductionThe ongoing geopolitical conflict between Israel and various regional actors has often been framed through religious and historical narratives. Among Muslims, the question of rightful ownership of the land commonly calledPalestineis frequently contested. However, a meticulous reading of Islamic scripture, particularlyQur'an 5:21, reveals a consistent acknowledgment of Jewish sovereignty over the Holy Land. This article aims to present a scholarly, text-based examination of this assertion, emphasizing that Allah Himself decreed the land to the Children of Israel. Furthermore, it argues that the modern concept ofPalestineas a national or ethnic entity did not exist during Muhammad’s lifetime, nor does it find mention in the Qur'anic text.2. Qur'an 5:21 and the Divine Grant to the Children of IsraelThe key passage for this study isQur'an 5:21, which reads:يَا قَوْمِ ادْخُلُوا الْأَرْضَ الْمُقَدَّسَةَ الَّتِي كَتَبَ اللَّهُ لَكُمْ وَلَا تَرْتَدُّوا عَلَى أَدْبَارِكُمْ فَتَنقَلِبُوا خَاسِرِينَ“O my people, enter the Holy Land which Allah has assigned to you and do not turn back, or you will become losers.”(Qur'an 5:21, Sahih International)In this verse, Moses addresses the Children of Israel, commanding them to enter the Holy Land (al-ard al-muqaddasah) which Allah hasassigned (kataba)to them. The Arabic termkatabaimplies a binding decree or divine ordinance, indicating that the land was granted to the Jewish people by divine will.Classical Islamic exegetessuch asIbn Kathir,Al-Tabari, andAl-Qurtubiconcur that this land refers to the region historically known as the Land of Canaan, later Judea and Israel. Ibn Kathir, in hisTafsir, explicitly states:“It is the land of Ash-Sham, specifically Bayt al-Maqdis (Jerusalem) and its surrounding areas, which Allah wrote for the Children of Israel.”Thus, according to both the Qur'anic text and authoritative Islamic exegesis, the Jewish people were divinely assigned this territory.3. Absence of \"Palestine\" in the Qur'an and Early Islamic HistoryNotably, the termPalestine(فلسطين) never appears in the Qur'an. At no point does the Islamic holy text refer to a nation, people, or territory by that name. During the Prophet Muhammad’s lifetime (570–632 CE), the area encompassing modern Israel was known in Greco-Roman usage asProvincia Syria Palaestina, a designation made by the Roman Emperor Hadrian in 135 CE following the suppression of the Bar Kokhba Jewish revolt.Islamic historiography, as documented in early texts such asAl-Baladhuri’s Futuh al-BuldanandIbn Ishaq’s Sirat Rasul Allah, references the region asBayt al-Maqdis,Iliya(from Aelia Capitolina, the Roman name for Jerusalem), orBilad al-Sham(Greater Syria). Nowhere is it calledPalestine, nor is there any recognition of a distinct Palestinian identity.The absence of this terminology in the Qur'an is significant, indicating that Islamic scripture recognizes territorial continuity associated with earlier Abrahamic traditions, particularly the Jewish claim to the land.4. Theological Implications and Modern MisinterpretationsModern Islamic political rhetoric often invokes religious sentiment against Israel by framing the conflict as a religiously mandated struggle overPalestinianland. However, this position lacks scriptural support within the Qur'an. On the contrary,Qur'an 5:21establishes a clear divine grant to the Jewish people.Even subsequent Qur'anic passages (e.g.,Qur'an 7:137andQur'an 17:104) reaffirm the idea that Allah favored the Children of Israel with this land:“And We caused the people who were oppressed to inherit the eastern and western parts of the land, which We had blessed.”(Qur'an 7:137)“And We said to the Children of Israel after Pharaoh: 'Dwell in the land, and when the promise of the Hereafter comes to pass, We shall bring you as a mixed gathering.’”(Qur'an 17:104)These verses confirm a Qur'anic pattern that associates Jewish people with the Holy Land, making contemporary claims of exclusive Muslim entitlement to the territory theologically untenable from a Qur'anic perspective.5. ConclusionA careful, text-based analysis of the Qur'an reveals that the Jewish people hold a divinely sanctioned claim to the Holy Land, as articulated inQur'an 5:21. Neither the termPalestinenor any Palestinian national or ethnic identity appears in the Qur'an or early Islamic sources. The Qur'anic position, corroborated by classical Islamic scholars, situates Jewish ownership of the land within a divine covenantal framework that modern political narratives cannot easily dismiss.This study calls for an honest, scripture-based discourse among Muslim and Jewish communities alike, recognizing the textual evidence within Islamic scripture itself.ReferencesThe Qur'an, Sahih International Translation.Ibn Kathir,Tafsir al-Qur'an al-Azim.Al-Tabari,Jami' al-Bayan fi Ta'wil al-Qur'an.Al-Qurtubi,Al-Jami' li-Ahkam al-Qur'an.Al-Baladhuri,Futuh al-Buldan.Ibn Ishaq,Sirat Rasul Allah.Wensinck, A.

    "full_content": "The Cultural Significance of Wanja (Kohl) and Lip Coloring in Ancient Arabian Traditions: A Critical Examination of Muhammad’s Use of CosmeticsBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba | Max Shimba Ministries OrgAbstractCosmetic practices such as the application ofwanja(kohl) and lip coloring have historically been associated with feminine beauty rituals and symbolic communication in various ancient cultures. This paper explores the historical roots of these practices in ancient Arabian society, their cultural meanings, and the implications of Prophet Muhammad’s personal use of cosmetics as recorded in Islamic traditions. The study critically examines the theological and anthropological consequences of these accounts for contemporary Islamic interpretations.1. IntroductionMany people today associate cosmetics — such aswanja(kohl), lip coloring, and skin lightening products — primarily with women. However, before forming assumptions about this, it is essential to trace the history of such beauty practices and when they began. Historical evidence indicates that these traditions originated centuries ago, particularly in ancient Arabian societies, with Egyptian women notably leading in the use of cosmetics for both beauty and cultural symbolism.This paper seeks to contextualize the use ofwanjain ancient Arabian traditions and critically analyze its significance, especially in light of recorded hadiths that report Prophet Muhammad’s personal use ofwanja. The question is raised: What meaning did such cosmetic application carry in the cultural context of Muhammad’s time, and what are the implications for contemporary Islamic thought?2. Historical Background of Wanja and Lip ColoringThe application ofwanjaand lip coloring was not merely for aesthetic purposes in ancient societies but carried significant cultural symbolism. For example, among African ethnic groups such as the Nyamwezi, Digo, and Bondei, a girl nearing puberty would traditionally be secluded, anointed with ashes, and later adorned withwanjaby elder women. This act signified her readiness for marriage and sexual maturity.Similarly, in ancient Arabian society, the application ofwanjaand red lip coloring conveyed explicit messages. A woman adorned in this way publicly signaled her sexual desire or readiness for marriage. The symbolism was deeply entrenched in communal customs, and such cosmetic choices were recognized as non-verbal cues within the cultural fabric.Prominent anthropologists and social scientists such as Deus Hans and Desmond Morris, in their nineteenth-century works, corroborated these interpretations. They noted that the reddening of a woman’s lips and the application ofwanjamirrored the physiological changes of the labia during sexual arousal. Consequently, these cosmetic practices had clear sexual connotations within traditional communities.3. Cosmetic Practices in the Time of MuhammadAlthough in modern times women apply cosmetics for various reasons, often unrelated to cultural signaling, in the era of Prophet Muhammad, such practices carried distinct meanings. A woman wearingwanjaor red lip color either signaled sexual availability or indicated her transition into marital eligibility following puberty.This context makes it important to interrogate Muhammad’s own reported cosmetic practices. According toSunan Ibn Majah, Hadith No. 309, it is recorded that:“Muhammad carried a mirror and a container of kohl (wanja) with him. He used a comb made from horn to groom his hair, applied oils, looked at himself in the mirror, and would applywanjato his eyes before sleeping. He also greatly loved perfumes.”This hadith, detailing Muhammad’s grooming routine, is significant given the cultural meanings attributed to these acts at the time.4. Theological and Anthropological ImplicationsGiven the Arabian cultural norms associated with cosmetic use, a pressing question arises: What was the Prophet Muhammad’s intention behind such practices? Within a society where applyingwanjaand lip coloring symbolized sexual desire or readiness for marriage, what did it signify when a man — and notably a religious leader — adorned himself in this way?This question demands careful theological reflection and honest anthropological inquiry. It presents a serious challenge for Islamic scholarship to reconcile prophetic practices with the prevailing cultural codes of the time, especially when those codes are laden with connotations that contradict Islamic modesty prescriptions in later jurisprudence.To dismiss this inquiry is to surrender intellectual integrity and reveal the limits of critical reasoning. Theological reasoning must not shy away from difficult questions but should confront them transparently.5. ConclusionThe history of cosmetics such aswanjaand lip coloring reveals their deep cultural significance in ancient Arabian society. When understood in this context, Prophet Muhammad’s reported use of these items raises important questions about his conformity to or divergence from societal norms laden with sexual and marital symbolism.This investigation calls for a nuanced, historically grounded, and theologically responsible engagement with early Islamic texts and cultural practices. Ignoring such matters or labeling them as irrelevant undermines intellectual honesty and religious integrity.A tragedy for Islam lies not in asking difficult questions but in refusing to answer them.Keywords:Muhammad and cosmetics, Arabian cultural traditions, wanja (kohl), Sunan Ibn Majah, Islamic anthropology, sexual symbolism, ancient beauty rituals, religious grooming practices.",

However, not all traditions within sacred texts or religious histories align with contemporary ethical standards. This article examines narratives from early Islamic Hadith literature that describe the Prophet Muhammad’s marriage to A’isha when she was a minor and the consummation of this marriage at an age modern ethics would consider deeply problematic. It invites a theological and moral evaluation of these accounts and raises critical questions for contemporary Muslim believers and apologists.2. Historical Context: Child Marriage in AntiquityIt is acknowledged that child marriage existed in various ancient cultures. Tertullian, a Christian theologian writing between 200–240 AD, observed that even \"barbarians\" refrained from giving their daughters in marriage before the age of 12 and their sons before 14 (On the Veiling of Virgins, Chapter 11, p. 34). Despite such practices, the marriage of girls below puberty was not a universal norm, and caution against such unions existed even among pagan cultures.3. Child Marriage and Muhammad: Analysis of Hadith SourcesSeveral authentic Islamic Hadiths, especially those fromSahih al-Bukhari,Sahih Muslim, andSunan Abu Dawud, describe Muhammad’s marriage to A’isha and the consummation of that marriage when she was 9 years old.For example:Sunan Abu Dawud, Volume 3, Book 36, Chapter 1769 (Hadith 4913, p. 1379)records that A’isha would play with dolls, and at times Muhammad would enter while she played with her friends. The children would leave when he entered and return afterward, implying that intimate marital relations occurred during those visits.The marriage of young girls continues in certain Muslim communities today, often justified by citing Muhammad’s precedent.A shocking case is reported fromIvory Coast, where a 12-year-old girl was burned with a hot iron by her father, imprisoned for three days without food, and married off to a 40-year-old man—all justified by the claim of preserving cultural and religious traditions (Source:Sauti Ttokea Nyuma ya Mtando, pp. 136-137).According toSahih Muslim, even Imam Shafi’i expressed reservations about child marriages, suggesting that such unions were viewed critically by some early Muslims themselves (Sahih Muslim Reference 1958, p. 715; Translator’s Note 1960, p. 716).Additionally, historical narratives record that Layla’s relatives warned her about Muhammad’s reputation for excessive lust toward women, advising her to seek annulment of a proposed union with him. Layla agreed, and Muhammad accepted the annulment (Al-Tabari, Volume 9, p. 139).4. Ethical and Theological ReflectionsThese historical accounts raise serious ethical and theological concerns:Can a prophet of God engage in practices considered abusive or morally reprehensible by both ancient and modern standards?Is it appropriate for religious communities to continue justifying harmful practices under the guise of prophetic precedent?The Qur’an itself describes Allah as a \"master schemer\" (Surah 3:54)—a verse raising complex theological questions about divine moral nature in Islam.It is essential for sincere believers to critically examine inherited traditions, especially when they contradict universal human rights and the teachings of other religious traditions, such as Christianity, which upholds the dignity of children and opposes child exploitation.5. Critical Questions for Islamic ApologeticsThis study poses the following direct questions to Muslim apologists and believers:Is Muhammad morally superior to the so-called ‘barbarians’of his time, who refrained from marrying off girls under 12?When Muslims claim Muhammad was sinless, does this imply that all his actions—including child marriage—must be endorsed without moral scrutiny?Is there any act of sexual abuse or coercion one would be willing to condemn even if Muhammad allegedly practiced or permitted it?Why do many modern, especially Western-educated Muslims distance themselves from these Hadith traditions?What truths are they recognizing that traditionalists overlook?Why did Muhammad consummate a marriage with a child incapable of consent?Would any father today, Muslim or not, allow his 8- or 9-year-old daughter to be taken by Muhammad under the same circumstances?6. ConclusionIt is evident that certain Hadiths and traditions, even if historically authentic within Islamic historiography, promote harmful practices that contradict both ancient wisdom and modern ethics. It is the moral duty of every believer and honest scholar to question these narratives, reevaluate inherited doctrines, and seek alignment with universal principles of justice, human dignity, and child protection. The contrast between the moral example of Jesus Christ and these accounts of Muhammad is stark and invites a critical reassessment of religious loyalties and moral reasoning.Max Shimba Ministries Orgcalls upon all readers, Muslims and non-Muslims alike, to critically examine religious traditions, reject harmful cultural practices, and embrace ethical monotheism grounded in the teachings of Christ.BibliographySahih al-BukhariSahih MuslimSunan Abu DawudAl-Tabari,History of the Prophets and Kings, Volume 9Tertullian,On the Veiling of VirginsSauti Ttokea Nyuma ya MtandoThe Qur’an",

While Muslim tradition venerates Muhammad as a sinless, elevated figure, the Qur’anic text contains verses in which Allah addresses him with stern language. This article juxtaposes these passages with Qur’anic descriptions of Jesus (Isa) — who is consistently spoken of in honorable terms — and compares this dynamic to the consistent dignity afforded to Jesus Christ within the Christian Scriptures. The reflection raises theological and doctrinal questions about Islamic eschatology, prophetic authority, and divine justice within the Qur’anic worldview.IntroductionMuhammad is deeply revered within Islamic tradition as the final prophet and the “Seal of the Prophets.” He is considered a figure of impeccable character and divine appointment. Yet, a critical reading of the Qur’an reveals passages where Allah issues direct reprimands, harsh statements, and even public humiliation of Muhammad. These verses challenge the popular perception of his spiritual status. More so, the Qur’an paradoxically addresses Jesus (Isa) in consistently honorable terms, raising further theological curiosity.This article examines these specific Qur’anic passages and raises essential questions:Why would Allah address his final messenger in such a disparaging manner?What do these passages imply about Muhammad’s spiritual standing?How do these interactions compare to the way God addresses Jesus in both the Qur’an and the Bible?What implications do these revelations hold for Muslim theology regarding heaven, hell, and prophetic authority?Textual Evidence and AnalysisA series of Qur’anic verses form the foundation for this inquiry:Mortality of Muhammad“Indeed, you (Muhammad) will die, and indeed, they too will die.”(Qur’an, Az-Zumar 39:30)And again:“Then on the Day of Resurrection you all will dispute before your Lord.”(Qur’an, Az-Zumar 39:31)Here, Allah bluntly declares the mortality of Muhammad, placing him on equal footing with his followers, which disrupts notions of prophetic transcendence.Muhammad as an Ordinary Man“Say: I am only a man like you…”(Qur’an, Al-Kahf 18:110)The Qur’an commands Muhammad to publicly identify himself as merely human, despite Islamic tradition that elevates him far beyond ordinariness.Muhammad's Sinfulness and Need for Forgiveness“So know that there is no deity except Allah and ask forgiveness for your sin and for the believing men and believing women.”(Qur’an, Muhammad 47:19)Nowhere does the Qur’an confirm Muhammad’s sins were forgiven — a troubling matter given his prophetic role.Inability to Guide Loved Ones“Indeed, you (Muhammad) do not guide whom you like, but Allah guides whom He wills.”(Qur’an, Al-Qasas 28:56)This passage portrays Muhammad as powerless in matters of salvation, contrary to the perception of a prophet interceding for his followers.Pointless Intercession for the Damned“Whether you (Muhammad) ask forgiveness for them seventy times — Allah will never forgive them.”(Qur’an, At-Tawbah 9:80)The verse renders Muhammad’s intercession ineffective, even repetitive and futile.Demand for Angels as Proof of Prophethood“And they say: O you upon whom the message has been sent down, indeed you are mad. Why do you not bring us the angels if you should be among the truthful?”(Qur’an, Al-Hijr 15:6-7)The absence of heavenly signs to support Muhammad’s claims undermines his credibility in the eyes of his opponents.Disparagement in Daily Life“And they say: What is this Messenger who eats food and walks in the markets? Why has an angel not been sent down to be a warner with him?”(Qur’an, Al-Furqan 25:7-8)The verse questions Muhammad’s prophetic legitimacy based on his mundane lifestyle.All Souls, Including Believers, Must Enter Hell“And there is none of you except he will come to it (Hell). This is upon your Lord an inevitability decreed.”(Qur’an, Maryam 19:71)And:“Then We will save those who feared Allah and leave the wrongdoers within it, on their knees.”(Qur’an, Maryam 19:72)This raises difficult soteriological questions about the fate of the righteous and whether paradise in Islamic theology is accessible without passing through Hell.Theological Questions and ReflectionsThese passages generate profound theological dilemmas:Who Are ‘We’ Who Will Save the God-Fearing?In Maryam 19:72, Allah refers to “We” saving the pious. Islamic theology traditionally asserts Allah alone saves. The plural raises questions about divine agency and authority.Why Must the Pious Enter Hell?The assertion that all — including believers — must experience Hell challenges conventional eschatological narratives of immediate paradise for the faithful. It suggests a grim universal judgment before redemption.Why Does Allah Rebuke His Own Messenger?It is troubling that Allah would publicly admonish and humiliate Muhammad, labeling him sinful, powerless, and ineffective. By contrast, Jesus in the Qur’an receives consistent honor and affirmation.In the Bible, God never speaks ill of Jesus Christ. On the contrary, He declares:“This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”(Matthew 3:17)The Qur’anic tone toward Muhammad stands in stark contrast to the biblical relationship between God and Christ, exposing a unique inconsistency in Islamic prophetic theology.ConclusionThis theological reflection challenges the Islamic portrayal of Muhammad’s spiritual perfection and unassailable authority. The Qur’anic text itself introduces narratives of rebuke, limitation, and humiliation that are absent from the divine treatment of Jesus both in the Qur’an and the Bible. It calls for a deeper inquiry into the authenticity of Muhammad’s prophetic claims, the nature of divine justice in Islam, and the ultimate fate of believers within Qur’anic eschatology.Max Shimba Ministries OrgKeywords:Qur’an, Muhammad, Jesus, rebuke, prophecy, Islamic theology, eschatology, divine justice, soteriology, prophetic authority, comparative religion.",

The paper questions the moral and theological implications of specific Qur’anic verses, Hadith narrations, and Islamic jurisprudence, particularly concerning women’s rights, female genital mutilation (FGM), legal punishments for adultery, and the depiction of paradise.IntroductionThe role and value of women within Islamic theology, both in this life and in the hereafter, has been a subject of ongoing debate and scrutiny. This article seeks to interrogate whether women truly have an equitable place in the Islamic paradise (Jannah) and examines Muhammad’s statements regarding women’s intellectual and spiritual status, as well as broader legalistic frameworks affecting Muslim women.Women in Islamic Teachings: A Review of TextsThe Prophet Muhammad, inSahih al-Bukhari, Book 2:541, is reported to have said:\"I have not seen anyone more deficient in intelligence and religion than women.\"Additionally, inSahih al-Bukhari, Book 7:33, Muhammad stated:\"I have not left behind me any affliction more harmful to men than women.\"Further,Sahih al-Bukhari, Book 7, Chapter 88:124, records Muhammad as saying:\"I stood at the gate of Hell and saw that the majority of its inhabitants were women.\"The Qur'an permits men to beat their wives inSurah An-Nisa 4:34. It also reduces women to objects of pleasure, likening them to fertile fields:*\"Your wives are a tilth for you, so go to your tilth as you will\" (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:223).In contrast, the Bible states:\"He who finds a wife finds a good thing and obtains favor from the Lord.\"(Proverbs 18:22)Additionally, Christian scriptures permit women to preach (1 Corinthians 11:1-5) and affirm Mary Magdalene as the first to witness and proclaim the risen Christ (John 20:16-18).Legal Punishments for Adultery: Whips or Stones?Although adultery in Islamic law was traditionally punished by stoning,Surah An-Nur 24:2prescribes one hundred lashes for both male and female adulterers, to be carried out in the presence of a community of believers. However, no distinction is made in this verse between married and unmarried offenders. This discrepancy arises because the practice of stoning is found not in the Qur’an, but in Hadith literature — notablySahih al-Bukhari, Book 8, No. 805.Notably, many modern Qur’anic translations place the phrase \"stoning to death\" within brackets inSurah An-Nur 24:2, indicating its absence from the original Arabic text. This raises a critical question: which law holds ultimate authority — that of Allah in the Qur'an or Muhammad's rulings in the Hadith?Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) in IslamThough globally condemned, female genital mutilation persists in many Islamic-majority countries. Muhammad’s position is preserved inSunan Abu Dawud, Book 41, Hadith 5251, where FGM is referred to as an honorable practice.Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal 5:75andAbu Dawud Adab 167similarly record approvals for female circumcision.In July 2014, the newly declared Islamic State of Iraq decreed that all women aged 11–46 undergo FGM, citing Islamic Sharia law. Notably, neither the Islamic State nor prominent Muslim clerics globally have officially refuted this mandate.Women in Islamic Paradise (Jannah)The Qur'an presents a sensual depiction of paradise, particularly tailored for men.Surah Al-Waqi’ah 56:10-40describes heavenly delights — wine, fruits, and specially created virgin companions. Yet, there is no explicit mention of what awaits Muslim women in Jannah.WhileSurah Az-Zukhruf 43:70states:\"Enter Paradise, you and your wives, in happiness,\"this raises a theological dilemma: What about Muslim women who remain unmarried in this life? Additionally, if Muslim men are promised heavenly companions of particular beauty and form, how will earthly couples remain united in the afterlife?A further paradox is posed bySurah Maryam 19:71-72, which declares that all people, including Muhammad and his followers, will pass through Hell before reaching Paradise. This adds tension to the portrayal of Islamic paradise as an immediate reward.Christian Conception of HeavenIn contrast, Christianity portrays heaven as a place for all believers — men and women alike.Matthew 22:30asserts that in the resurrection, people will neither marry nor be given in marriage. Instead, they will be like angels in heaven. Christ promises inJohn 14:1-3that believers will dwell with Him and the Father, and1 Thessalonians 4:17affirms that believers will eternally be with the Lord.Key Questions for Theological ReflectionWhy did Allah permit female genital mutilation (FGM) while globally it is denounced as a human rights violation?What is the true source of the punishment of stoning for adultery — the Qur’an or Muhammad’s Hadith?Does Muhammad’s Hadith override Allah’s commandments in the Qur’an?Why was the punishment of one hundred lashes, as stated inSurah An-Nur 24:2, seemingly abrogated by the practice of stoning?Will unmarried Muslim women in Jannah be given seventy-two male companions as Muslim men are promised female virgins?ConclusionThis inquiry invites both Muslim and non-Muslim scholars to critically evaluate these scriptural inconsistencies and theological injustices, particularly in matters concerning women. Where Islam’s paradise appears to promise sensual and gendered pleasures for men, Christianity affirms an eternal, spiritual union with God for all believers. It challenges the reader to question the moral foundation of eschatological rewards and urges individuals to seek Christ, in whom there is neither male nor female, but all are one (Galatians 3:28).Call to Reflection:Examine these matters diligently. Seek truth beyond tradition. Come to Jesus Christ.",

    "full_content": "By:Max Shimba Ministries OrgAbstractThis article investigates the identity of 'Allah' — whether He is the true God or a deceptive entity, often identified in Christian polemics as Satan. Through a historical-linguistic and theological analysis, the article explores how the term 'Allah' originated, its pre-Islamic pagan context, and its adoption into Islam. It emphasizes the importance of seeking verified religious truth over inherited beliefs and offers a reasoned Christian critique of the Islamic conception of God.IntroductionThere are two significant, widely misunderstood, and hotly contested perspectives regarding the question,“Who is Allah?”Around this issue, numerous unverified claims, deep-seated biases, and sometimes even baseless hostility circulate, which cloud objective discussion. While some people feel peace when they hear the nameAllah, believing He is the Creator God, others firmly maintain thatAllahis not God but rather Satan — the great deceiver, a false god. These conflicting sentiments evoke strong emotions in people’s hearts, which can obstruct our ability to objectively seek and recognize truth in this matter.This article invites readers to momentarily suspend their rigid positions and religious preconceptions, and instead ask themselves some crucial questions. Before evaluating evidence that might prove whetherAllahis the true God or not, I openly affirm the existence of the true Creator God of heaven and earth. However, it is essential to acknowledge how often we accept religious claims simply because they are passed down to us by others — through oral traditions, public sermons, or media broadcasts.While faith itself is not inherently harmful, it bears a considerable risk: that our goodwill and religious sincerity might be exploited by those with self-serving motives. Thus, it becomes vitally important to seek evidence and continuously test our beliefs, lest we discover too late that we’ve been misguided when it is no longer possible to amend our course.The Necessity of Verifying Religious ClaimsIn matters of faith, it is crucial to discern precisely what God commands — whether one identifies as a Muslim or a Christian. Each person must acquire firsthand understanding of God’s word so they can test everything presented to them in the name of divine authority. Otherwise, people of ill intent might preach false doctrines under the guise of God’s instructions, and sincere individuals might accept these teachings in good faith, mistakenly believing them to be divine.Muslims, for example, display commendable zeal in seeking and serving God. It is remarkable for a person to visit a house of worship five times a day, including at dawn when physical rest still beckons. Such dedication indicates a sincere intention to know and serve God.We have often heard of people sacrificing their lives for their faith. While I do not personally endorse such acts, putting aside the question of whether these deeds are right or wrong, one must admit that this level of devotion testifies to a genuine longing for God. The crucial question, however, is this:“Is this truly what God commands?”It seems almost unthinkable that a loving father with ten children would commend one of them for killing his siblings simply because he was ordered to do so. Or that such a father would declare,“Whoever kills his brothers will receive my love more abundantly.”Believing in the wrong thing — however sincerely — ultimately leads to disaster.The Etymology and Historical Origins of the Name 'Allah'The nameAllahoriginates fromal-Ilah. The prefixalfunctions much like the English definite article“the”, whileilahmeans“god”. Thus,al-Ilahtranslates to“the god”. Over time, linguistic evolution caused this compound to contract intoAllah. This kind of linguistic transformation is common. In Swahili, for example, one might hear someone say‘ndo ivo’, a shortened form of‘ndiyo hivyo’. It is conceivable that a century from now, people might not even realize the origin of‘ndo ivo’.Historically,Allahwas not originally the name of the monotheistic God of Abraham but was instead the title of a moon god in pre-Islamic Arabia. This moon deity had a wife believed to be the sun and daughters known asal-Lat,al-Uzza, andManat. These three goddesses were revered as high deities among the pantheon of gods worshipped by the Arabs before the advent of Islam — a period Muslims refer to asJahiliyyah(the age of ignorance).The termAllahwas masculine in form, which is evident since one of his daughters was calledal-Lat, a feminine variant. Just asFrancisis masculine andFranciscais feminine in European languages, so it was withAllahandal-Lat. Both names share the same root, differing only by gender.One of the communities that ardently worshippedAllahwas the Quraysh tribe, from which the Prophet Muhammad himself emerged.Was ‘Allah’ Known in Abrahamic Tradition Before Islam?There is a widespread misconception among many who assume thatAllahwas an unknown entity until Muhammad introduced him. Others claim thatAllahwas already known during Abraham’s time in the same sense as today. If that were true, one must then ask:How did the God of Abraham disappear, only for a pagan ‘Allah’ to emerge in his place?The historical evidence points clearly to the fact that theAllahof pre-Islamic Arabia was a pagan deity, one of many worshipped in a polytheistic society. Therefore, it cannot be logically consistent to conflate this paganAllahwith the monotheistic Creator of heaven and earth revealed in the Bible.ConclusionBased on this evidence — etymological, historical, and theological — I openly affirm thatAllahis not the true God of the Bible, but rather a pagan deity later appropriated into Islam. In Christian theological understanding, any entity that presents itself as God but is not the true God of Scripture operates under satanic deception. Hence, I conclude, with conviction, thatAllah, as presented in Islam, aligns more closely with the biblical concept of Satan than with the Holy God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.Max Shimba Ministries Org",

Among certain radical Islamic factions, the destruction of religious imagery associated with other traditions has been justified as a defense of monotheism and a rejection of idolatry. However, a closer examination of ritual practices within Islam—particularly those associated with the Kaaba in Mecca—reveals paradoxical elements that mirror the very behaviors these groups condemn. This paper critically explores the contradictions inherent in religious enforcement ideologies and practices, highlighting the sociological and theological implications of ritual object veneration within contemporary Islam.IntroductionReligious iconoclasm—the deliberate destruction of religious icons, statues, and sacred sites—has been a recurrent phenomenon across civilizations. In the modern era, certain radicalized Islamic movements have claimed exclusive authority to police the boundaries of monotheism through violent iconoclasm. From the demolition of ancient Buddhist statues in Afghanistan to the destruction of Christian crosses in parts of Europe and the vandalizing of Hindu and Shinto shrines in South and East Asia, these acts are publicly justified as a defense against idolatry (shirk). However, a critical investigation into the concept of idolatry within Islam and the ritualistic practices surrounding the Kaaba and the Black Stone (al-Ḥajar al-Aswad) reveals significant theological contradictions that merit closer scholarly scrutiny.Iconoclasm and Its Historical Rationale in Islamic ThoughtIslamic theology, especially in its early development, positioned itself against what it perceived as the polytheism and idolatry of pre-Islamic Arabia. The Prophet Muhammad’s reported cleansing of the Kaaba from its pre-Islamic idols is frequently cited as a foundational moment in Islamic monotheism (taḥwīd). Classical jurisprudence and theological texts have maintained a firm stance against any form of object-veneration that could potentially rival devotion to God. Yet, the distinction between reverence and idolatry has often been a subject of interpretative flexibility, allowing for ritualistic practices that, while officially monotheistic, bear striking resemblance to the customs condemned elsewhere.The Paradox of the Kaaba and Ritual Object VenerationCentral to Islamic worship is the Kaaba in Mecca, a cube-shaped structure believed by Muslims to have been constructed by Abraham and Ishmael. During daily prayers (ṣalāh), Muslims worldwide face the Kaaba, and the annual Hajj pilgrimage centers around ritual acts performed in its vicinity. Among these is the veneration of the Black Stone, which pilgrims traditionally attempt to kiss or touch. Additionally, the symbolic stoning of three pillars representing Satan, head-shaving, and circumambulation (ṭawāf) around the Kaaba during Hajj bear ritualistic similarities to practices in other religious traditions historically denounced by Islamic theologians.Comparative religious studies note parallels between these practices and the symbolic rituals of other faith systems, such as the Kumbh Mela pilgrimage in Hinduism, which involves mass bathing and ritual purification rites. Furthermore, the persistent emphasis on the physical Kaaba as the geographic and spiritual axis of the Muslim world introduces complexities into Islamic claims of aniconism and strict anti-idolatry, as it effectively sacralizes a particular object and location.The Irony of Religious Enforcement and Theological ExclusivismThe aggressive iconoclasm perpetrated by certain radical Islamist groups illustrates a theological inconsistency: while these groups denounce the veneration of religious images and objects in other faiths, they simultaneously participate in rituals that confer sacred status upon specific objects and spaces within their own tradition. This suggests that their iconoclasm is not purely driven by theological principle, but often by political and cultural motivations aimed at asserting religious dominance and cultural hegemony.The sacralization of the Kaaba and the Black Stone functions as a rebranded form of religious symbolism, maintained through ritual and theological justification rather than through consistent doctrinal application. As such, the claim of monotheistic purity becomes problematic when juxtaposed with ritual practices that exhibit clear parallels to the object-veneration behaviors they seek to eradicate elsewhere.ConclusionThe paradox inherent in Islamic iconoclasm, wherein idol-breakers become inadvertent idolaters, underscores the complexity of religious enforcement ideologies. The conflation of theological purity with cultural supremacy has led to selective interpretations of what constitutes idolatry, permitting ritual practices within Islam that mirror those condemned in other faiths. This reveals a profound irony at the heart of religious enforcement movements: while claiming to dismantle idolatry, they perpetuate it through alternative symbols, rituals, and sacred geographies.A nuanced, historically and theologically informed approach is necessary to unpack these contradictions and foster interfaith dialogue that acknowledges the shared human impulse towards sacred symbolism, rather than condemning it selectively. Future scholarship might benefit from comparative analyses between Islamic rituals and those of other traditions, illuminating the universal patterns of sacred object veneration beneath the rhetoric of religious exclusivity.Keywords:Iconoclasm, Islamic theology, Kaaba, Black Stone, idolatry, religious ritual, monotheism, Hajj, religious enforcement, religious symbolism",

Theologians have long interpreted this as the foundation for a spiritual dichotomy within humanity: one lineage aligned with divine purpose and moral order, the other with rebellion and disorder (Hamilton, 1990; Sailhamer, 1996). This polarity is echoed in the teachings of Jesus Christ, particularly in the parable of the wheat and tares (Matthew 13:24–30, 36–43), where the world is depicted as a field containing both the children of the Kingdom and the children of the evil one.This article aims to examine how this biblical framework informs Christian theological anthropology and ethical expectations, and to evaluate critically the anthropological and ethical constructs within Islamic thought and praxis. The argument is made that while Christianity upholds a vision of humanity rooted in imago Dei, moral conscience, and redemptive potential, certain elements within Islamic jurisprudence and ritual practice betray a theological anthropology that is incompatible with these values, lacking both a coherent moral compass and a spiritually life-affirming ethic.Biblical Foundations: Two Lineages in Genesis and MatthewGenesis 3:15 serves as a pivotal theological text in the Judeo-Christian tradition, often regarded as theprotoevangelium, the first announcement of redemption (Wenham, 1987). The 'seed of the woman' and the 'seed of the serpent' symbolize two antithetical orientations of human existence: one towards God and righteousness, the other towards rebellion and destruction. This dichotomy recurs throughout Scripture—in narratives such as Cain and Abel (Genesis 4), the sons of God and daughters of men (Genesis 6), and ultimately in Jesus' teachings.InMatthew 13:24–30, Jesus elaborates on this division through the parable of the wheat and tares, illustrating how, within the same human field, two types of people coexist: those belonging to God and those aligned with evil. The eschatological resolution will separate the two, yet until then, discernment is necessary as appearances often deceive. This theme reinforces the biblical warning that not all who appear human bear the divine image in a redemptive sense (John 8:44).Anthropological and Ethical Critique of IslamWhen this biblical framework is applied to the comparative study of world religions, particularly Islam, significant anthropological and ethical divergences emerge. Islamic theology, while monotheistic, structures its anthropological vision and ethical system around jurisprudential legality rather than moral conscience shaped by divine love. Classical Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) has historically sanctioned practices such as child marriage, concubinage of war captives, and severe penalties for apostasy (Lewis, 2002; Ibn Rushd,Bidayat al-Mujtahid). These permissions stand in stark contrast to the biblical ethic, which grounds human dignity in the imago Dei and demands compassion and justice as reflections of divine character (Genesis 1:26–27; Micah 6:8).Furthermore, Islamic ritual practice, particularly the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, exemplifies a mechanistic religiosity devoid of the relational intimacy emphasized in biblical faith. The circumambulation of the Kaaba, a central rite, has been critiqued by scholars for its symbolic disconnect from a personal, covenantal relationship with God, reducing spirituality to ritual performance (Peters, 1994). While Christianity demands moral transformation through regeneration (John 3:3–6) and relational love (1 John 4:7–12), Islam frequently privileges external submission (Islamitself meaning ‘submission’) to divine command, often at the expense of inward ethical renewal.The Quranic portrayal of God asal-Mutakabbir(The Supreme) andal-Qahhar(The Subduer) frames divine-human interaction in terms of absolute authority and legal obligation, with limited space for grace-based, relational encounter (Nasr, 2003). This theological structure has, in various contexts, underpinned a religio-political culture where acts such as honor killings, forced conversions, and religiously sanctioned violence have found legal or social justification (Ali, 2015). Such practices reflect an anthropology that diminishes the intrinsic value of the individual and suppresses moral conscience in favor of juridical conformity.ConclusionThe biblical narrative posits a fundamental spiritual distinction within humanity: those who pursue God’s justice, mercy, and relational love, and those who align with chaos and moral nihilism. When applied to religious systems, this framework invites rigorous ethical and anthropological critique. While Islam shares superficial theological parallels with biblical monotheism, its juridicalism, depersonalized spirituality, and problematic moral allowances situate it within the lineage of structures that, in biblical terms, perpetuate spiritual death rather than life.This theological critique does not dismiss the dignity of individual Muslims, many of whom seek moral good within their cultural context. Rather, it underscores the necessity of evaluating religious systems not merely by their professions of faith but by the fruits they produce in human dignity, justice, and compassion (Matthew 7:16–20). In this, Christianity’s insistence on love, conscience, and imago Dei remains an unparalleled foundation for human flourishing.ReferencesAli, Ayaan Hirsi.Heretic: Why Islam Needs a Reformation Now.

While the Christian West ventured into transoceanic exploration, industrialization, and space travel, the Islamic world, dominated by the Ottoman Empire and other Muslim polities, often remained preoccupied with internal power dynamics and religious orthodoxy. The study explores key historical moments—from Columbus’ 1492 voyage to the 1969 Moon landing—and investigates the cultural, theological, and institutional factors contributing to the disparities in scientific and technological advancement between these civilizations. The paper argues for a nuanced understanding of civilizational progress, recognizing both periods of brilliance and stagnation within each tradition, and calls for a balanced historiographical approach in comparative civilizational studies.Keywords:Western Christendom, Islamic Civilization, Ottoman Empire, Scientific Innovation, Industrial Revolution, Space Exploration, Comparative History, Religion and Modernity, Technological AdvancementIntroductionThe historical interaction between Western Christendom and the Islamic world has shaped much of the modern global order. From military conquests and theological disputes to cultural exchanges and economic rivalries, these two great civilizations have profoundly influenced one another and the broader course of human history. However, the trajectories of their development, particularly regarding scientific innovation and technological progress, diverged markedly from the late 15th century onward.This paper seeks to trace that divergence through a comparative analysis of key historical milestones, examining how religious worldviews, political institutions, and socio-cultural priorities shaped the capacity of each civilization to embrace innovation and exploration. Rather than adopting a polemical stance, this study employs a historical-critical methodology to contextualize periods of civilizational ascendancy and decline within their appropriate socio-religious frameworks.1. 1492 and the Dawn of Global ExplorationThe year 1492 is a watershed moment in global history. As Christopher Columbus, under the commission of the Catholic Monarchs of Spain, embarked on his transatlantic voyage, the Christian West was undergoing the Renaissance—a period marked by rediscovery of classical knowledge and renewed emphasis on human agency and empirical inquiry. In contrast, the Islamic world, under the leadership of the Ottoman Empire, was consolidating its control over Southeastern Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa.While the Ottomans were a formidable military and cultural force, their focus remained largely inward, emphasizing religious orthodoxy, dynastic consolidation, and control of existing trade routes rather than maritime exploration. The comparative lack of Islamic participation in the Age of Exploration is indicative of differing civilizational priorities during this period.2. The Industrial Revolution and Technological ModernityBy the early 18th century, the Industrial Revolution began to reshape Western societies. The invention of the steam engine in 1712 by Thomas Newcomen—and later improved by James Watt—marked the beginning of mechanized industry and a new phase of economic and technological expansion. This period saw Christian Europe transform its societies through innovations in transportation, manufacturing, and communications.Conversely, many parts of the Islamic world struggled to adapt to these changes. The Ottoman Empire, beset by internal power struggles and administrative conservatism, resisted widespread industrialization. Theological constraints and the prioritization of religious orthodoxy over empirical inquiry contributed to a comparative stagnation in scientific development.3. The 20th Century: Flight, Space, and Modern CivilizationThe 20th century further amplified this divergence. In 1903, the Wright brothers—sons of a Christian minister—achieved the first powered human flight, marking the dawn of modern aviation. This event symbolized the culmination of centuries of scientific inquiry and mechanical innovation in the Christian West.By mid-century, the United States achieved another historic milestone with the Apollo 11 Moon landing in 1969, carrying both technological achievement and religious symbolism. While Western nations engaged in a space race emblematic of Cold War rivalries, much of the Islamic world grappled with post-colonial nation-building, political instability, and ongoing theological debates.4. Contemporary Reflections: Demographics, Religion, and InnovationIn the contemporary era, while Western nations explore Mars and harness advanced digital technologies, many Islamic-majority societies continue to navigate tensions between religious tradition and modernity. Islam’s rapid demographic growth has been frequently cited as a sign of global vitality; however, critics note the relative scarcity of globally recognized scientific and technological breakthroughs from these regions.It would be reductive, however, to attribute this solely to religious doctrine. A complex interplay of colonial legacies, geopolitical conflicts, and institutional constraints also accounts for these disparities. As such, both Western and Islamic civilizations have experienced alternating periods of intellectual brilliance and stagnation.ConclusionThis study underscores the necessity for balanced historical analysis in assessing the comparative development of civilizations. While the Christian West forged paths in scientific and technological innovation from the Age of Exploration to the Space Age, the Islamic world’s priorities often lay elsewhere, shaped by internal religious, political, and social imperatives.Recognizing these differences without resorting to cultural essentialism allows for a more nuanced understanding of how civilizations rise, flourish, and falter. Future studies should further explore how both religious and secular ideologies influence patterns of innovation and the complex ways in which historical memory shapes contemporary identity and progress.",

    "full_content": "A Comparative Analysis with Biblical EthicsBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThroughout history, religious texts have been subject to scrutiny, interpretation, and comparative analysis to assess their claims of divine origin and moral authority. One of the most debated issues in Islamic theology concerns the unique privileges granted to Muhammad in the Qur'an — privileges not extended to his followers, and which conspicuously coincide with moments of personal desire or scandal in his life. This paper offers a critical examination of these verses within the Qur’an, comparing them to Biblical narratives of patriarchal moral failure, and evaluating the theological implications for the concept of divine impartiality and holiness.Muhammad’s Exclusive Privileges in the Qur’anSeveral Qur'anic passages reveal peculiar concessions made specifically for Muhammad. A closer analysis of these texts suggests an unsettling pattern where divine revelations seem tailored to accommodate his personal interests, particularly in matters of marriage, sexual access, and household affairs.Surah 33:50provides Muhammad with an exclusive list of women he is permitted to marry or engage with sexually — including wives, cousins, slave girls, and any believing woman who offers herself to him. Notably, these allowances are restricted to the Prophet alone:“O Prophet, indeed We have made lawful to you your wives, those your right hand possesses… and a believing woman if she gives herself to the Prophet — if the Prophet wishes to marry her — [this is] only for you, excluding the [other] believers.”(Qur’an 33:50)InSurah 33:51, Allah grants Muhammad discretionary authority to favor certain wives and postpone others without consequence:“You may defer [the turn of] any of them you wish and take to yourself whomever you wish, and any that you desire of those whom you had set aside, there is no blame upon you.”Surah 66:1–2addresses an incident where Muhammad vowed to cease relations with his slave concubine, Maria the Copt, to appease his wives’ jealousy. Rather than uphold his word, a new revelation appears, rebuking him for forbidding what Allah made lawful:“O Prophet, why do you prohibit [yourself from] what Allah has made lawful for you, seeking to please your wives? And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.”Perhaps most controversially,Surah 33:37records Muhammad’s attraction to his adopted son Zayd’s wife, Zaynab bint Jahsh. Subsequently, a revelation arrives permitting the marriage:“And when Zayd had no longer any need for her, We married her to you so that there would not be upon the believers any discomfort concerning the wives of their adopted sons.”Even household etiquette is managed by divine decree.Surah 33:53advises guests not to linger in Muhammad’s home after meals to avoid infringing on his personal time:“When you are invited, enter; and when you have eaten, disperse without seeking to remain for conversation. Indeed, that was troubling the Prophet, and he is shy of [dismissing] you.”The consistent pattern suggests that revelations often served to resolve Muhammad's immediate domestic and personal predicaments, rather than addressing timeless, universal moral or theological concerns.Comparative Reflection: The Bible and Prophetic Moral FailureIn the Biblical tradition, figures such as Abraham, David, and Solomon indeed took multiple wives and concubines. However, unlike the Qur’an’s treatment of Muhammad, the Bible neither condones nor grants divine approval for these actions. Instead, the Hebrew Scriptures record such behaviors as moral failings with clear negative consequences:David’s adultery with Bathshebaand arranged murder of her husband resulted in severe judgment, including the death of their child (2 Samuel 12:9–14).Solomon’s polygamyand idolatry led to the division of the Israelite kingdom (1 Kings 11:1–13).The absence of divine endorsement for these acts underscores the Bible’s commitment to the principle that all humans, including prophets, are accountable to God’s moral law. Their failings serve as cautionary tales rather than precedents.Theological ImplicationsThe divergence between the Qur’an’s accommodation of Muhammad’s personal life and the Bible’s portrayal of prophetic fallibility raises significant theological questions. If a deity is truly holy, impartial, and transcendent, the expectation would be for moral consistency and justice — qualities compromised if divine revelation appears selectively self-serving. The Qur’an’s repeated intervention in Muhammad’s private affairs under the guise of revelation challenges the integrity of its claim to be a universal, immutable word of God.Moreover, the preferential treatment granted to Muhammad contradicts the Islamic assertion of his being a \"mercy to all worlds\" (Qur’an 21:107) and a model of moral perfection. If the sacred text reinforces inequitable privileges rather than holding its prophet accountable, it not only undermines its ethical credibility but invites the conclusion that the deity of the Qur’an functions more as a personal agent of the prophet’s will than as a sovereign, righteous God.ConclusionA careful, contextual, and comparative reading of the Qur’an alongside the Bible reveals marked differences in how prophetic misconduct is treated. The Biblical God remains morally consistent, rebuking even His chosen servants when they sin. In contrast, the Qur’anic Allah frequently appears as an enabler of Muhammad’s desires, issuing timely revelations that address his personal concerns, particularly in matters of marriage and social convenience.Such a pattern casts serious doubt upon the claim of divine impartiality in the Qur’anic message. It invites modern scholars and theologians to reevaluate the theological foundations of Islam, particularly where prophetic conduct and divine holiness intersect. It is the duty of any sincere seeker of truth to discern whether a religious system elevates human desire above moral law or upholds a transcendent, holy standard for all — prophets included.By Dr. Maxwell Shimba,Shimba Theological Institute",

Drawing directly from the Qur’an, this study explores the unique relationship between Allah and Isa Ibn Maryam as expressed in the sacred Islamic text and presents an argument for Isa’s divinity within this context.The Nature of God and SpiritScripture affirms thatGod is Spirit(John 4:24), just as human beings possess a spirit, a soul, and dwell in a body. The intrinsic nature of spirit cannot be separated from its identity. A person’s spirit is fundamentally themselves — inseparable and essential. This theological principle applies universally: one cannot detach the essence of a being from its spirit.Qur'anic Testimony of Isa Ibn MaryamUpon examining the Qur’an, I discovered a consistent declaration that Isa Ibn Maryam uniquely shares in the Spirit of Allah in a way no other prophet or human being does. Consider the following verses:Al-Tahrim 66:12:“And Mary, daughter of Imran, who guarded her chastity, and We breathed into her of Our Spirit. She believed in the words of her Lord and His scriptures and was of the devoutly obedient.”Here, the Qur’an states that what entered Mary’s womb wasthe Spirit of Allah, not a created spirit butOur Spirit, referring to Allah’s own essence.Al-Nisa 4:171:“The Messiah, Isa son of Mary, was only a Messenger of Allah and His Word which He conveyed to Mary, and a Spirit from Him…”Notably, Isa is called boththe Word of Allahanda Spirit from Him, placing him in a unique ontological category distinct from any other prophet.Al-Anbiya 21:91:“And she who guarded her chastity, so We breathed into her of Our Spirit and made her and her son a sign for all peoples.”Again, Isa’s conception is directly linked tothe Spirit of Allah, not a created spirit or angel.Theological Reasoning: The Spirit of Allah Is AllahNo other human being — neither prophets, messengers, nor ordinary people — is ever described in the Qur’an asthe Spirit of Allah. This distinction reserved for Isa signifies a unique divine relationship. Simple reflective reasoning leads to a powerful conclusion:Is my spirit and I two different beings?No. My spirit is essentially myself.Is the Spirit of God not God Himself?Indeed, the Spirit of God is inseparable from His essence.Thus, ifthe Spirit of Allahentered Mary and became Isa, how can Isa not be Allah, since the Spirit of Allah is Allah Himself?If Allah affirms Isa to be“Our Spirit”, then Isa bears the divine essence and identity.ConclusionThe Qur'an, a book declared to be without doubt by Muslims (Al-Baqarah 2:2), explicitly teaches that Isa Ibn Maryam isthe Spirit of Allah. By following both the Qur’anic declarations and theological logic — thatthe Spirit of Allah is Allah Himself— one must conclude that Isa partakes in the divine nature.Such a conclusion aligns perfectly with Christian theology as revealed in Titus 2:13, where Jesus is called“our Great God and Savior.”Final ReflectionThis theological reflection invites both Muslim and Christian scholars to re-examine the identity of Isa Ibn Maryam within their respective scriptures. If the Qur’an indeed testifies that Isa isthe Spirit of Allah, and the Spirit of Allah is Allah Himself, then Isa’s divinity is affirmed, not merely within Christian doctrine but within the textual witness of the Qur’an itself.",

An Examination of Biblical and Historical EvidenceAuthor: Dr. Maxwell ShimbaInstitution: Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionMuslims frequently pose the question:Is the prophet mentioned in Deuteronomy 18:17–18, 33:1–2, and 34:10–11 referring to Muhammad or Jesus?This article endeavors to provide a clear, biblical, and historical response to this inquiry.Deuteronomy 18:15-18 and the Prophet Like MosesDeuteronomy 18:15-18 states that God would raise up a prophet like Moses from among the Israelites’ own brethren, and the people were commanded to listen to him. The primary considerations are:Was Jesus a prophet?Did most Jews hear Jesus?Was Jesus one of the Israelites?The biblical record affirms that Jesus was indeed a prophet (Luke 24:19), that He was heard by many (John 7:46; Matthew 7:28-29), and that He was a Jew from the tribe of Judah (Matthew 1:1-17; Hebrews 7:14). Historically, early Christian scholars affirmed that this prophecy more appropriately describes Jesus rather than Muhammad.Historical TestimonyAs a historical note, long before the Council of Nicaea (325 AD), Archelaus (262–278 AD) affirmed that Deuteronomy 18:15 could refer to no other person than Jesus Christ, as recorded inDisputation with Manes, chapter 43, p. 219.Further Considerations:a.Deuteronomy 33:1-2mentions “the Lord” coming with ten thousand of saints. Muslims do not call Muhammad their Lord. While some minor sects like the Alawites and other Ghulat sects have deified Muhammad, this is not mainstream Islamic belief.b.Deuteronomy 34:10records, “Since then, no prophet has risen in Israel like Moses.” This description, likely written by Joshua long before Jesus' advent, was still ultimately fulfilled in Jesus according to Christian testimony.c.Deuteronomy 34:10also emphasizes Moses’ unique communication with God “face to face.” Muhammad did not claim direct communication with God but rather via the angel Gabriel (Qur’an 2:97). In contrast, Jesus directly communicated with God the Father (John 1:18).d.Deuteronomy 34:11highlights Moses' mighty signs and wonders. Muhammad, according to the Qur’an (17:90–93), did not perform miracles of this magnitude, whereas Jesus performed numerous miraculous signs (John 20:30-31).e.Qur’anic ConfirmationQur’an 29:27 affirms that prophecy was bestowed through Isaac and Jacob, Abraham’s descendants. The Yusuf Ali translation states, “And We gave him Isaac and Jacob, and ordained among his progeny Prophethood and Revelation.” Interestingly, the Arabic text does not include the word \"Abraham,\" but Yusuf Ali inserted it for clarity. This implies that Muhammad, being a descendant of Ishmael and not Isaac, falls outside this prophetic lineage according to the Qur’an itself.f.Apostolic WitnessThe Apostle Peter declared in Acts 3:22–26 that this prophecy in Deuteronomy was fulfilled in Jesus. Either:Jesus erred by allowing Peter to mislead people for nearly 2,000 years without divine correction,Jesus deliberately appointed Peter, knowing he spoke truthfully,Or Peter never made such claims, and the book of Acts was corrupted before external textual evidence from as early as 138 AD could affirm the opposite.Patristic TestimonyEarly church fathers consistently identified Jesus as the fulfillment of Deuteronomy 18:15-18:Justin Martyr (114–165 AD),First ApologyIrenaeus (182–188 AD)Tertullian (c. 220 AD)Origen (225–254 AD)John Chrysostom (407 AD)Justin Martyr, writing between 138 and 165 AD, evidently engaged with this prophecy before composing his works.Textual Integrity of the New TestamentA Muslim might argue that Justin Martyr was mistaken, and all New Testament manuscripts misquoted Peter. However, early translations and manuscript traditions, independently transmitted across regions (Africa, Asia, Europe), consistently preserve Peter's declaration concerning Jesus in Acts 3:22–26.For Further Reading:Geisler, N.

From a Christian theological perspective, this narration appears to imply a deity whose mercy is actualized and perpetuated through the continued moral failure of His creation. It suggests a transactional dynamic where sin is, in some sense, necessary for the manifestation of divine forgiveness.Such a notion stands in sharp contrast with the biblical portrayal of God's holiness and human sanctification. In the New Testament, particularly in Romans 6:1–2, the Apostle Paul firmly addresses a similar issue:“What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?”Here, Paul repudiates any suggestion that sin should be tolerated or perpetuated for the purpose of magnifying divine grace. In Pauline theology, the redemptive work of Christ delivers believers from both the penalty and dominion of sin. Grace is not a license to persist in wrongdoing, but a transformative power that enables believers to live in righteousness.The Problem of Divine Mercy Dependent on SinFrom a classical theistic perspective, the idea that God wouldcreate people to sin so He might forgive thempresents serious theological difficulties. It implies a deity whose mercy is reactive rather than essential to His immutable nature. In Christian doctrine, God’s mercy is an inherent attribute of His being (Exodus 34:6-7), not contingent upon the moral failure of His creatures. The forgiveness extended through Christ’s atonement is a redemptive response to human sin, but it does not necessitate the continuous presence of sin to validate God's merciful character.Furthermore, classical Christian theology, as formulated by Augustine, Aquinas, and others, affirms that while God permits sin within the framework of human free will, He neither causes sin nor requires it to manifest His attributes. To suggest otherwise, as the hadith seems to do, would risk aligning the divine will with the perpetuation of moral evil — a notion that borders on theological fatalism.The Satanic Parallel: The Role of the TempterTheologically, one could argue that the logic of this hadith resembles the role traditionally ascribed to Satan in both biblical and Qur'anic narratives — namely, to entice humanity into sin. In Christian theology, Satan is depicted asthe tempter(Matthew 4:3), whose purpose is to alienate humanity from God through sin. The notion of a deity who would actively will the creation of sinners for the purpose of exercising forgiveness appears incompatible with the biblical depiction of a holy God who abhors sin (Habakkuk 1:13) and desires the sanctification of His people (1 Thessalonians 4:3).ConclusionIn summary, this hadith, when juxtaposed with the biblical testimony, reveals a fundamental theological divergence between Islamic and Christian conceptions of divine holiness, mercy, and the purpose of human moral agency. Where Christianity emphasizes deliverance from sin through the transformative power of grace, Islam, at least as represented in this narration, appears to accommodate a cyclical relationship between sin and forgiveness, potentially undermining the finality and efficacy of divine grace.From a Christian apologetic standpoint, such a portrayal might be interpreted as compromising the moral transcendence of God and inadvertently attributing to Him a role closer to that of the tempter — a role universally condemned in biblical theology. This distinction underscores the importance of a coherent and morally consistent doctrine of God in religious thought.",

    "full_content": "The Echoes of Baal and Molech in Islamic Theology: A Comparative Analysis of Child Death Traditions in Islam and Ancient Near Eastern ReligionBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaAbstractThis paper explores theological and ritualistic parallels between ancient Semitic deities—specifically Baal and Molech—and Islamic theology as preserved in early hadith literature. Particular focus is given to narrations concerning the death of children and their eschatological utility in Islam, drawing comparisons with the cultic child sacrifices historically offered to Baal and Molech for divine favor. This comparative analysis raises ethical and theological questions about the character of Allah within Islamic tradition and suggests a pattern of religious syncretism that merits careful scholarly scrutiny.1. IntroductionReligious belief systems often emerge within cultural environments steeped in myth, ritual, and inherited theological frameworks. Islam, though claiming to be a pure monotheistic revelation, arose in a seventh-century Arabian context saturated with diverse polytheistic traditions and vestiges of ancient Near Eastern religious practices. This paper investigates one unsettling theological parallel: the way the death of children is portrayed as spiritually advantageous in both Islamic eschatology and ancient Semitic fertility cults.2. Islamic Hadith on Child Death and ParadiseThe hadith collections of Islam contain numerous narrations where Muhammad addresses the fate of children who die before reaching puberty. Two notable examples include:Al-Adab Al-Mufrad 148“There is no woman among you who has three children die, resigning them to Allah, who will not enter the Garden.” A woman asked, “And if it is two?” He replied, “And if it is two.”(Source)Sunan an-Nasa’i 1873“There is no Muslim, three of whose children die before reaching puberty, but Allah will admit him to Paradise by virtue of His mercy towards them.”(Source)In these traditions, child death becomes a conduit for the parent's guaranteed admittance into Paradise, portraying death as a transactionally beneficial event rather than a tragedy to be lamented. This view introduces complex ethical and theological questions, particularly when juxtaposed with the explicit biblical prohibitions against child sacrifice and transactional suffering.3. The Cult of Baal and Molech: Historical ContextThe ancient Near East was rife with deities demanding human sacrifice, particularly of children.Baal, a Canaanite storm and fertility god, was often worshiped through rituals seeking rain and harvest, sometimes including the offering of children during times of drought or crisis.Molech(also spelled Moloch), a god of the Ammonites, is infamously associated with child immolation:“They built the high places of Baal in the Valley of Ben Hinnom to sacrifice their sons and daughters to Molech, though I never commanded—nor did it enter my mind—that they should do such a detestable thing.”—Jeremiah 32:35 (NIV)The practice involved offering children in fiery sacrifices to secure divine intervention or blessing. Scholars such as John Day (Molech: A God of Human Sacrifice in the Old Testament, 1989) have argued convincingly that this practice was widespread in the ancient Levant and directly condemned by Yahweh through the Hebrew prophets.4. Theological Parallels and Ethical ImplicationsWhile Islam categorically forbids literal human sacrifice, thetheological economyfound in these hadith—where a child’s death translates into spiritual profit for the parent—reflects atransactional relationship between human suffering and divine favorremarkably similar to the cultic patterns of Baal and Molech.The distinction is technical rather than conceptual: whereas Baal and Molech demanded the child's life as an offering, Allah is portrayed as rewarding the parent for the passive loss of the child. Yet in both frameworks, the death of the innocent becomes an instrument for achieving divine benefit.From a biblical-Christian ethical standpoint, this theological structure is profoundly problematic. The God of the Bible abhors child sacrifice (cf.Leviticus 18:21, 20:2–5) and portrays children as blessings to be cherished (cf.Psalm 127:3–5), not as instruments for transactional spiritual gain.5. Historical Syncretism and the Origins of AllahMultiple scholars have noted thatpre-Islamic Arabian religionfeatured a high god namedAllahworshiped alongside lesser deities (known as thedaughters of Allah: al-Lat, al-Uzza, and Manat). Arthur Jeffery, inThe Foreign Vocabulary of the Qur'an(1938), documented that many Quranic terms and concepts were borrowed from Syriac, Hebrew, and pre-Islamic Arab paganism.The Kaaba in Mecca, Islam's holiest site, housed360 idolsbefore being claimed by Muhammad. It functioned as a religious hub for various pagan Arab tribes — many of whom offered sacrifices (animal and occasionally human) to secure favor from their gods, including Allah. The transactional theology of death and divine favor in Islam thus appears as a theologicalresidue of pagan religious economy, refined within a monotheistic framework.6. ConclusionWhile Islam positions itself as a pure, uncorrupted monotheism, critical examination of its hadith traditions reveals theological structures eerily reminiscent of ancient pagan practices. The transactional view of child death as a means of securing Paradise bears disturbing parallels to the sacrificial economies of Baal and Molech.This theological overlap, coupled with historical evidence of syncretism in early Islam, suggests thatAllah's character in certain Islamic traditions reflects echoes of older Semitic deitiesrepurposed within a monotheistic framework. From a biblical and ethical standpoint, this raises significant challenges to the Islamic claim of theological continuity with the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.BibliographyArthur Jeffery,The Foreign Vocabulary of the Qur'an.

It has long been suggested by Christian apologists and historians that certain theological and ritualistic aspects of Islam bear a striking resemblance to pre-Islamic pagan practices and to ancient Semitic deities such asBaal,Molech, and representations ofSatanin the biblical tradition. In this study, we will explore one such correlation: the handling of child death in Islam and its theological implications in comparison to the cultic practices of Baal and Molech.1. Islamic Traditions on the Death of ChildrenIslamic hadith literature contains several narrations concerning the fate of children who die young. Among these, the Prophet Muhammad is reported to have said:“There is no woman among you who has three children die, resigning them to Allah, who will not enter the Garden.”—Al-Adab Al-Mufrad 148(sunnah.com)Similarly, another hadith states:“There is no Muslim, three of whose children die before reaching puberty, but Allah will admit him to Paradise by virtue of His mercy towards them.”—Sunan an-Nasa’i 1873(sunnah.com)These traditions underscore a theological economy wherein the death of innocent children serves as a means of spiritual benefit for the bereaved, almost functioning transactionally: the child dies, and the parent is promised Paradise.2. Parallels to Ancient Baal and Molech WorshipIn the Hebrew Bible,BaalandMolechare depicted as Canaanite deities associated withchild sacrifice. The worship of Baal often involved fertility rituals, including child offerings in times of crisis to appease the god and secure blessings. Molech, specifically, was known for the gruesome practice of child immolation:“They built the high places of Baal in the Valley of Ben Hinnom to sacrifice their sons and daughters to Molech, though I never commanded—nor did it enter my mind—that they should do such a detestable thing.”—Jeremiah 32:35 (NIV)Both Baal and Molech demanded the lives of children under the premise of securing divine favor, blessing, or deliverance — a theological framework strikingly echoed in these Islamic hadiths where the death of children guarantees eternal reward.While Islam explicitly forbids human sacrifice, the underlying theological structure of associating the death of innocent children with divine reward appears hauntingly familiar to the transactional relationship ancient Near Eastern deities maintained with their worshipers.3. Theological Implications and Satanic ParallelsIn biblical theology,Satanis characterized as a destroyer, a deceiver, and the one who delights in the destruction of innocence (cf.John 8:44; Revelation 12:9–10). Any religious system that frames the death of innocent children as divinely beneficial raises profound ethical and theological concerns. From a Christian theological perspective, the god who benefits from or rewards human suffering — particularly the death of innocent children — reflects not the character of the God revealed in Christ, but one more akin to the adversarial nature of Satan himself.The Quran and hadith's positioning of Allah as one who promises Paradise in exchange for the deaths of children arguably aligns him more with the ancient images of Baal and Molech than with the benevolent, life-affirming God of the Bible. Notably, both Baal and Molech were regional deities of the pre-Islamic Arabian Peninsula and greater Levant, cultures with which early Islam was in continuous contact.4. Historical Syncretism and the Identity of AllahScholars such as Arthur Jeffery (The Foreign Vocabulary of the Qur'an, 1938) and others have argued thatAllahas worshiped by Muhammad was a transformation of a pre-Islamic moon deity of Mecca, linguistically and theologically intertwined with earlier Semitic deities. The semantic overlaps, cultic practices (including the pilgrimage to the Kaaba, which housed 360 idols before Islam), and transactional theology concerning death and divine favor point to asyncretic inheritancerather than a unique monotheistic revelation.ConclusionWhen viewed through a historical-theological lens, the depiction of Allah in certain hadith traditions—particularly those concerning the spiritual utility of child deaths—shares unsettling similarities with the cultic practices of Baal and Molech. Such parallels warrant rigorous comparative theological inquiry. The transactional view of child death in Islamic eschatology resonates far more with ancient Semitic paganism than with the compassionate, life-giving God of biblical Christianity.Thus, from a scholarly perspective, these hadiths serve not only as a window into the religious worldview of early Islam but also as a potential echo of older, darker religious traditions repackaged in monotheistic terminology.",

O you who believe! Send your Salat on him, and greet him with the Islamic way of greeting.”(Qur’an 33:56)Other translations, such as that of Qaribullah, render the phrase as:“Allah and His angels praise and venerate the Prophet. Believers, praise and venerate him.”This raises a profound theological question:what does it mean for Allah — the supreme, self-sufficient, transcendent deity of Islamic monotheism — to performsalat(prayer, blessings, or praise) upon a created being, namely Muhammad?1.The Lexical and Theological Tension: What is Salat?The Arabic wordsalat(صلاة) typically refers to prayer or ritual supplication. In Islamic theology,salatis the prescribed act of worship offered by human beings to God five times daily. However, when attributed to Allah Himself in this verse, it generates a semantic and theological challenge: ifsalatis understood as prayer or invocation, then upon whom does Allah pray? To whom does the Almighty direct His act ofsalat?Islamic exegetes such as Al-Tabari and Al-Qurtubi have grappled with this issue. Many have attempted to resolve the dilemma by redefiningsalatin this context assending blessings,mercy, orhonour. Yet, the consistency of the word’s usage elsewhere in the Qur’an — particularly when referring to acts performed by creatures toward God — leaves open the question of how it could signify something categorically different when ascribed to Allah.2.Does Allah Engage in Worship or Intercessory Acts?Ifsalatfundamentally denotes worship, praise, or supplication, then attributing it to Allah suggests a form of veneration or communicative act directed toward another. This poses a theological problem for Islamic tawhid (absolute monotheism), which asserts that Allah is utterly self-sufficient (Al-Samad, Qur’an 112:2) and dependent on no one.Thus, the critical question emerges:If Allah is offeringsalat, then to whom is this act directed?Is Allah engaging in an act akin to worship or intercession, and if so, to what or to whom?If the meaning ofsalatchanges contextually when attributed to Allah, does this not risk semantic equivocation within divine speech?3.The Elevation of Muhammad in Islamic DevotionThe same verse commands believers to likewise sendsalatupon Muhammad, effectively placing the Prophet in a unique position of continual veneration, both by the Creator and His creation. This has led some scholars, both Muslim and non-Muslim, to question whether this form of praise and exaltation of Muhammad blurs the strict Creator-creation distinction foundational to Islamic theology.It has also fueled polemical critiques from Christian and Jewish theologians throughout history, suggesting that Islamic practice risks elevating Muhammad to a quasi-divine status, effectively incorporating an intermediary figure between humanity and God, much like saints or demi-gods in other religious traditions.4.Conclusion: A Theological DilemmaThis verse, when read plainly, suggests that Allah performs an act —salat— toward Muhammad, alongside His angels, and then commands His followers to do the same. This raises unavoidable theological and philosophical questions:Does Allah, the utterly transcendent Being, engage in acts of praise or veneration?If so, to what higher reality is this act directed?Ifsalatmeans different things when performed by Allah versus when performed by His creatures, what grounds this difference linguistically and theologically?And does this continual exaltation of Muhammad suggest a mediating role that potentially conflicts with the strict monotheism claimed by Islamic doctrine?Such questions invite further critical reflection within Islamic theology, Qur’anic hermeneutics, and comparative religious studies. They also underscore the importance of precise definitions and consistency in attributing actions to the divine within any monotheistic framework.",

The Qur'an asserts:\"And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me.\"(Qur’an 51:56)While this passage establishes the intended purpose for both human and jinn existence, it leaves unanswered a critical question:On which day of creation were the jinn created?This is a fundamental theological issue that deserves close examination because it reveals significant gaps and ambiguities within Islamic cosmology — especially when compared to the detailed, orderly chronology of creation provided in the Bible.The Order of Creation in Islamic Tradition: A Missing ElementIslamic scripture, notably the Qur'an, mentions the creation of the heavens, the earth, and all that is in between insix days:\"Indeed, your Lord is Allah, who created the heavens and the earth in six days...\"(Qur'an 7:54)However, what is conspicuously absent in the Qur'an is a clear, sequential account of what was created on each of those six days — unlike the Genesis narrative in the Bible (Genesis 1:1–31), which meticulously records each day's creative acts.This leads to the following pressing question for Muslim scholars and apologists:On which specific day did Allah create the jinn?While hadith literature and tafsir (commentaries) offer varying opinions, none present a definitive, consistent, or universally accepted day within the six-day framework. Some Islamic scholars suggest the jinn were created before mankind, citing passages such as:\"And the jinn We created before from scorching fire.\"(Qur’an 15:27)Yet even here, the exact timing remains ambiguous. Was it on the first day, second day, or sometime before the six days of creation began? The Qur’an remains silent on this matter.The Biblical Contrast: A Clear ChronologyIn stark contrast, the Bible presents a coherent, day-by-day account of creation. Genesis 1 details the order of creation from light, the firmament, dry land, vegetation, celestial bodies, animals, and finally mankind on the sixth day. There is no mention of beings such as jinn, since such a category does not exist in Biblical theology — only angels and humans are recognized as sentient, moral beings.This contrast underscores a theological deficiency in the Qur'an’s creation narrative. While the Bible provides believers with a structured, understandable cosmology, the Qur'an leaves its adherents with unresolved ambiguities, raising questions about the consistency and completeness of its account.A Challenge to Muslim ScholarsTherefore, we respectfully challenge our Muslim counterparts:Provide us with a definitive, Qur'an-based account specifying on which day of the six-day creation Allah created the jinn.If the Qur'an is, as it claims, a clear and detailed book of guidance (Qur’an 16:89), why does it omit such a crucial element of its cosmology? Is it reasonable to believe in a text that establishes the purpose of a created being (worship) without establishing when that being came into existence within its cosmological framework?This theological inconsistency invites further scrutiny into the reliability of Islamic cosmology and raises broader questions about the internal coherence of Qur'anic revelation.Shalom,Dr. Maxwell ShimbaMax Shimba Ministries Org",

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaMax Shimba Ministries OrgAbstractThis paper critically examines the Qur’anic assertion in Surah 6:101 regarding the impossibility of God having a son without a consort and juxtaposes it against the Christian doctrine of the divine Sonship of Jesus Christ. The article interrogates the conceptual limitations within the Qur’anic anthropomorphic framing of divine procreation and contrasts it with the biblical understanding of the incarnation, where the miraculous birth of Jesus Christ from the Virgin Mary was an act of divine sovereignty unbound by human biological requirements. Through exegetical, theological, and philosophical inquiry, this work challenges the Islamic contention and offers a robust defense of the divinity and sonship of Jesus Christ within Christian thought.IntroductionThe identity and nature of God, and the concept of divine sonship, have been central points of divergence between Christianity and Islam. The Qur’an explicitly rejects the notion of God begetting a son, employing human analogies of procreation to argue against Christian claims of Jesus’ divine sonship. One of the clearest articulations of this is found in Surah 6:101:“[He is] the Originator of the heavens and the earth. How could He have a son when He does not have a companion and He created all things? And He is, of all things, Knowing.”This rhetorical question presupposes that for God (Allah) to have a son, He would need a female consort. This anthropomorphic limitation reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of the Christian doctrine of the eternal Sonship of Jesus Christ. This paper aims to unpack this Qur’anic presumption and contrast it with the theological reality of the incarnation and divine sonship in biblical theology.The Qur’anic Argument Against Divine SonshipIn several passages, the Qur’an vehemently denies that God can have a son (cf. Surah 4:171; 5:72-73; 19:88-92). The underlying argument in 6:101 is predicated on an anthropocentric understanding of begetting: that begetting necessitates a sexual partner, implying biological procreation.This anthropomorphism is problematic for several reasons:Conceptual Limitation:The Qur’anic assertion limits the capacity of divine action to human biological frameworks. It fails to account for the possibility that a sovereign, omnipotent God could bring forth a Son in a non-sexual, transcendent manner.Inconsistency with Islamic Belief in the Virgin Birth:The Qur’an affirms the virgin birth of Jesus (Surah 3:45-47; 19:16-21). In Surah 19:20, Mary asks,“How can I have a son when no man has touched me?”and is told that it is a decree from Allah. If God can cause a virgin to conceive without a man, then by the Qur’an’s own standards, it is possible for God to bring forth a Son without a consort.This presents a theological inconsistency: on the one hand, denying divine sonship on the grounds of no consort (6:101), while on the other affirming a miraculous birth without a male counterpart.Category Error:The Qur’an conflatesbegettingin the human, physical sense withgenerationin the eternal, metaphysical sense. Christian theology never teaches that God the Father begot Jesus through physical intercourse. Rather, it asserts theeternal generation of the Son— that the Son is eternally begotten of the Father, a relationship existing outside of time, space, and physical process.The Christian Doctrine of the Eternal Sonship of ChristIn Christian theology, the titleSon of Godis not indicative of biological descent but denotes the unique and eternal relationship between the Father and the Son within the Trinity. As articulated in the Nicene Creed (325 AD):“We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only Son of God, eternally begotten of the Father, Light from Light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, of one being with the Father.”This doctrine maintains:Eternal Generation:The Son’s origin is from the Father, but not in a temporal or physical sense.Consistent with Divine Nature:God is spirit (John 4:24) and does not procreate as humans do.Incarnation by Divine Fiat:The conception of Jesus in the womb of Mary was by the power of the Holy Spirit (Luke 1:35), not through physical union.Thus, the Christian claim is metaphysical and relational, not biological. The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit exist in an eternal relationship of mutual indwelling and love.The Problem of Qur’anic AnthropomorphismThe Qur’an frequently anthropomorphizes divine action to fit human paradigms — a practice that leads to theological inconsistencies:Creation without Means:Allah is described as creating by command,“Be, and it is”(Surah 3:47). If God can create ex nihilo (from nothing) by mere will, why impose human limitations regarding sonship?Virgin Birth of Jesus:If Mary can conceive Jesus without a husband by divine decree, it is illogical to deny God’s capacity to have a Son simply due to a lack of a consort.The Qur’anic reasoning in 6:101 thus exposes a theological inconsistency within Islamic thought: asserting divine omnipotence in some cases while denying it in others based on anthropocentric assumptions.A Philosophical Perspective on Divine SonshipFrom a philosophical standpoint, the Christian concept of divine sonship reflects a metaphysical relationship rather than a physical act. The notion ofeternal generationsignifies:Ontological Equality:The Son shares the same divine essence (homoousios) as the Father.Relational Distinction:The Father begets, the Son is begotten, and the Spirit proceeds — relationships within the Trinity reflecting roles, not inequality or temporality.Transcendent Causality:The begetting of the Son is an eternal act of divine self-revelation, unbounded by time, space, or material processes.ConclusionThe Qur’anic objection in Surah 6:101 against God having a Son without a consort reflects a misunderstanding of the Christian doctrine of the eternal Sonship of Christ. By imposing human biological categories upon divine action, the Qur’an inadvertently limits the omnipotence it elsewhere ascribes to God.Christian theology asserts that Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God, was not begotten through a consort but exists eternally in relation to the Father. His incarnation through the Virgin Mary was a miraculous act of divine will, consistent with the omnipotence and transcendence of God.The inconsistency within Islamic theology, affirming the virgin birth while denying the possibility of divine sonship on biological grounds, highlights the inadequacy of the Qur’anic critique. A proper understanding of divine nature necessitates moving beyond anthropomorphic limitations to grasp the metaphysical depth of the Christian claim: that in Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God entered human history for the salvation of mankind.ReferencesThe Qur’an, Surah 6:101; 3:45-47; 19:16-21.The Holy Bible, Luke 1:35; John 1:1-14; John 4:24.The Nicene Creed (325 AD).Anselm of Canterbury,Cur Deus Homo.Thomas Aquinas,Summa Theologiae, Part I, Question 33.Gerald O’Collins,Christology: A Biblical, Historical, and Systematic Study of Jesus.William Lane Craig,Reasonable Faith: Christian Truth and Apologetics.",

This apologetic strategy, often termedscientific apologetics, attempts to validate the divine origin of the Quran by aligning its verses with contemporary scientific understanding. However, upon closer inspection, these claims frequently fall short under historical, textual, and scientific scrutiny. In this segment, I will critically examine one such claim regarding geological knowledge in the Quran, compare it with antecedent biblical literature, and then briefly outline a framework for categorizing the Quran’s so-called scientific statements — many of which either reflect pre-existing beliefs, are misinterpreted, or are scientifically erroneous.The ‘Mountains as Pegs’ Claim in the QuranA frequently cited example of “miraculous science” in the Quran is found inSurah 78:6–7:\"Have We not made the earth as a wide expanse, and the mountains as pegs?\"(Surah An-Naba, 78:6–7)Muslim apologists assert that this verse reflects advanced geological knowledge, suggesting that mountains possess deep roots beneath the surface of the earth, thus stabilizing it — a notion compatible with the modern understanding of isostasy and tectonic plates. However, this interpretation demands scrutiny on several grounds.1. The Idea Was Not Unique to the QuranThe concept of mountains having roots was neither novel nor miraculous at the time of the Quran’s compilation. The Hebrew Bible, written centuries before Muhammad, contains similar imagery. Consider the following examples:Job 28:9 (NIV):“People assault the flinty rock with their hands and lay bare the roots of the mountains.”Jonah 2:6 (NIV):“To the roots of the mountains I sank down; the earth beneath barred me in forever.”In these passages, the metaphorical concept of mountains having roots was already well-established within the biblical tradition. These references predate the Quran by over a millennium and suggest that such imagery was part of the wider ancient Near Eastern cosmology rather than an instance of divine revelation unique to Muhammad.2. The Misapplication of Modern GeologyWhile modern geology indeed confirms that mountain ranges have subterranean roots, this should not be retroactively read into ancient texts unless those texts explicitly articulate such a concept in scientific terms. The Quran’s use ofpegs (awtād)is metaphorical, in line with prevailing ancient worldviews where mountains were imagined as stakes or tent pegs holding down the earth’s flat expanse — a cosmological motif common in pre-Islamic Arab poetry and folklore.Moreover, early tafsir (commentaries) by Muslim scholars such asIbn KathirandAl-Tabariinterpreted these verses metaphorically as well, seeing mountains as stabilizing features but not offering scientific explanations akin to plate tectonics or geological isostasy.Categories of Alleged Scientific Knowledge in the QuranWhen reviewing the full corpus of alleged scientific miracles in the Quran, we find that these claims fall into three distinct categories:Category 1: Verses Misinterpreted to Align with Modern ScienceMany Quranic verses are made to say things they do not explicitly state through forced or selective interpretation. A well-known example is the claim that the Quran describes theBig BanginSurah 21:30:“Do not those who disbelieve see that the heavens and the earth were joined together, then We split them apart?”Islamic apologists interpret this as a description of the Big Bang, despite the text’s original intent likely referring to the separation of the earth and heavens in the ancient Near Eastern cosmology of a flat earth covered by a solid firmament.Category 2: Knowledge Widely Known Prior to the QuranNumerous scientific facts attributed to the Quran were already well known in surrounding cultures and civilizations before the 7th century CE. For instance, notions aboutembryology, which Muslims often cite as a Quranic miracle, can be traced to earlier Greek medical authorities such asHippocrates(c. 460–370 BCE) andGalen(c. 129–210 CE). The embryological sequence mentioned inSurah 23:12–14mirrors concepts in Galenic medicine more closely than any revelation from an omniscient source.Category 3: Scientifically Erroneous StatementsA number of Quranic verses make claims that are flatly contradicted by modern scientific knowledge. Among these:Surah 18:86claims the sun sets in a muddy spring:“Until, when he reached the setting of the sun, he found it setting in a spring of black muddy water...”Scientifically, the sun neither sets in any earthly body of water nor is the sun’s setting a local event.Surah 67:5equates stars with meteorites:“And We have certainly beautified the nearest heaven with lamps (stars) and have made from them what is thrown at the devils...”This suggests that stars (billions of light years away) serve as projectiles against devils, a notion incompatible with contemporary astrophysics.Surah 86:7locates the origin of semen “between the backbone and the ribs”:“Emitted from between the backbone and the ribs.”Human semen is produced in the testes, which anatomically reside in the scrotum, and not between the spine and ribs. Even accounting for poetic language, this description misrepresents human reproductive anatomy.ConclusionUpon careful textual, historical, and scientific analysis, the claim that the Quran contains miraculous scientific knowledge does not withstand academic scrutiny. Not only do purported scientific verses either reflect ideas already present in earlier biblical or Greco-Roman texts, but many are also forced reinterpretations or scientifically erroneous. As such, these apologetic arguments fail to provide compelling evidence for the Quran’s divine origin.A genuinely divine text would be expected to transcend the limitations of its historical and cultural milieu, offering knowledge demonstrably inaccessible to its contemporaries. The Quran, by contrast, mirrors the cosmology, anthropology, and embryology of the 7th-century Arabian world — a clear indication of its human authorship.The conversation about science and scripture must remain honest, historically grounded, and free from anachronistic projections of modern knowledge onto ancient texts. In light of these observations, the assertion that the Quran contains scientifically miraculous knowledge remains unsupported.Dr. Maxwell ShimbaFounder & Director, Shimba Theological InstituteOrlando, Florida",

    "full_content": "There Is No Scientific Knowledge in the Quran – Part Two: A Critical Examination of Embryology in Surah 23:12–14By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractClaims regarding miraculous scientific foreknowledge in the Quran have long been propagated by Islamic apologists, with embryology often presented as a key example. This paper critically evaluates the embryological claims in Surah 23:12–14, contextualizing them within the framework of ancient Greek embryological knowledge and comparing them with established modern scientific evidence. The study demonstrates that not only are the Quranic descriptions of embryological development derivative of pre-Islamic sources such as Aristotle and Galen, but they also contain scientifically inaccurate statements inconsistent with contemporary embryological understanding.IntroductionIn modern Islamic apologetics, much has been made of the assertion that the Quran contains prescient scientific facts unknown in the 7th century CE, which allegedly confirm its divine origin. Among the most frequently cited examples is its supposed description of human embryological development in Surah 23:12–14. Muslim scholars and popular preachers assert that the Quran’s account mirrors modern embryology in remarkable detail. However, a careful examination of both the historical and scientific context reveals that these claims are unfounded.This paper seeks to situate the Quranic text within the historical continuum of ancient embryological theories and juxtapose its content against current embryological knowledge, thereby dispelling the notion of its miraculous scientific accuracy.Textual Analysis of Surah 23:12–14The passage in question reads:“And indeed We created man from an essence of clay; then We placed him as a drop in a secure lodging; then We made the drop into a hanging thing (alaqah), then We made the hanging thing into a chewed lump (mudghah), then We made out of the chewed lump bones, then We clothed the bones with flesh, then We developed it into another creation. So blessed be Allah, the best of creators.”(Quran 23:12–14)Proponents of Quranic scientific miracles typically focus on two key features:The assertion of development instages.The depiction of the embryo attaching to the uterus (a safe lodging).However, as this analysis will demonstrate, these concepts were neither novel in the 7th century nor scientifically precise by contemporary standards.Historical Context: Embryological Knowledge Before IslamAristotle (384–322 BCE)InOn the Generation of Animals, Aristotle presents a systematic explanation of embryological development. He identified sequential stages of formation and growth, observing that certain organs and structures arise before others. In Book IV, 734a, Aristotle describes how the heart forms first, followed by other vital organs and tissues. He also noted the importance of a safe environment within the mother’s womb for the developing embryo.Aristotle’s observations, though not fully accurate by modern standards, demonstrate an advanced awareness of staged development and uterine attachment, concepts widely circulated in Greco-Roman medicine centuries before the Quran.Galen (129–c. 200 CE)Perhaps more directly influential was the Greek physician Galen, whose treatiseOn the Natural FacultiesandOn the Formation of the Fetusdetail human development stages. Galen described the embryo as initially a formless substance, subsequently developing into a form resembling a chewed lump and later solidifying into bones. Crucially, Galen maintained that bones form first and are then “clothed” in flesh — an idea echoed verbatim in the Quranic text.Given the transmission of Greco-Roman medical texts through Syriac and Persian intermediaries, it is historically plausible that Muhammad or his contemporaries encountered Galenic embryology either directly or indirectly through oral tradition.Scientific Inaccuracies in the Quranic AccountModern embryology, based on centuries of anatomical and genetic research, has demonstrated that:Themesoderm— a primary germ layer — gives rise to both bone and muscle tissues simultaneously, not sequentially as suggested in the Quran.Bones do not initially form and then acquire flesh. Instead,cartilaginous modelsof bones and muscle masses develop in parallel during embryogenesis, with ossification (bone hardening) occurring later.Moreover, the termmudghah(chewed lump) is anatomically imprecise and does not reflect any scientifically identifiable stage of human embryonic development. While it might subjectively resemble the visual appearance of somite segmentation, this is an imprecise and primitive description, inconsistent with modern embryological classification.The Quranic account's reliance on visually and texturally based analogies (hanging thing, chewed lump, clothed bones) reflects observational limitations of pre-scientific cultures rather than inspired or miraculous knowledge.Derivation, Not Revelation: The Greek Medical Legacy in the QuranThe linguistic and conceptual parallels between Galen’s embryological model and the Quranic text have led several historians of medicine to conclude that the Quran’s account was derived from pre-existing medical traditions. Scholars such as Edward Gibbon and W. Montgomery Watt note the extensive cross-cultural interactions between Arabian, Persian, and Byzantine societies, particularly through the translation movements in the pre-Islamic Near East.It is historically implausible to assert that Muhammad, operating within a milieu already influenced by Hellenistic medicine, could produce a unique or divinely inspired account of embryology when the same concepts — including the sequential formation of bones and flesh — appear in Galenic writings composed centuries earlier.ConclusionThe claim that the Quran contains miraculous scientific knowledge regarding embryology is not substantiated upon critical examination. The description in Surah 23:12–14 reflects the rudimentary and derivative understanding of human development available in Greco-Roman antiquity. Far from being divinely revealed insights into biological science, the Quranic embryological narrative appears to be a rearticulation of ideas previously established by figures such as Aristotle and Galen.Additionally, the Quranic sequence of embryonic development is scientifically inaccurate, particularly in its assertion that bones form before flesh. Modern embryology, grounded in detailed anatomical observation and molecular biology, has decisively demonstrated that musculoskeletal structures develop concurrently from the mesoderm.Consequently, the embryological descriptions in the Quran do not offer evidence of miraculous foreknowledge but rather reveal the limitations of 7th-century Arabian knowledge and its dependence on earlier Hellenistic medical traditions.ReferencesAristotle.On the Generation of Animals, Book IV.Galen.On the Natural Faculties, trans.

A Critical Examination of the Islamic Claim of Muhammad’s Illiteracy and Its Use as Evidence for the Divine Origin of the Qur’anDr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteAbstractMany Muslims argue that the Prophet Muhammad’s alleged illiteracy serves as proof that the Qur’an must be divinely inspired, claiming that it would be impossible for an illiterate man to produce a text of such literary and rhetorical sophistication. However, both internal Islamic sources and linguistic evidence raise significant questions about whether Muhammad was truly illiterate. This paper critically examines the Islamic claim of Muhammad’s illiteracy, the meaning of the Arabic termummiyun, and considers historical hadith evidence that suggests Muhammad may have possessed reading and writing skills. Ultimately, this study argues that Muhammad’s literacy or illiteracy is irrelevant to claims of divine authorship, as the Qur’an was compiled in written form only after his death.IntroductionThe claim of Muhammad’s illiteracy is one of the traditional apologetic positions used by Muslim scholars to affirm the miraculous nature of the Qur’an. The popular reasoning posits:how could an unlettered man produce a literary masterpiece such as the Qur’an unless aided by divine revelation?(Nasr, 2003). This belief is largely built upon the interpretation of certain Qur’anic verses and early Islamic traditions. However, closer examination of primary sources and linguistic evidence problematizes this assertion.The Qur’an’s Compilation and the Irrelevance of Muhammad’s LiteracyIt is universally acknowledged within Islamic historiography that the Qur’an was revealed orally to Muhammad and memorized by his followers before it was compiled into a written codex after his death during the caliphate of Abu Bakr and completed under Uthman (al-Bukhari, Hadith 4986). Therefore, whether Muhammad was literate has no direct bearing on the production of the Qur’anic text. As Denny (2006) observes, \"The Qur'an itself was a product of oral tradition long before it became a book.\"Thus, even if Muhammad had been illiterate, it would not automatically prove divine authorship of the Qur'an, as the text's preservation and composition were human activities undertaken by literate companions.The Linguistic Ambiguity of the TermUmmiyunOne of the primary textual bases for the claim of Muhammad’s illiteracy is found inSurah 7:157, where Muhammad is referred to asal-nabiyy al-ummiy(ٱلنَّبِىَّ ٱلْأُمِّىَّ). Traditionally,ummiyis translated asunletteredorilliterate. However, authoritative lexicographical works, such as Edward Lane’sArabic-English Lexicon, reveal thatummiyalso meansgentile, or one not belonging to the People of the Book (Lane, 1863, p. 92).This understanding is contextually supported bySurah 62:2, which speaks of Muhammad being sent to theummiyun(ٱلْأُمِّيِّينَ), conventionally rendered asthe unlettered, but which can reasonably be read asthe gentiles, contrasting them with Jews and Christians. Watt (1953) notes that in pre-Islamic usage,ummiyunoften denoted those outside the Judeo-Christian scriptural tradition.Therefore, the evidence does not conclusively affirm that Muhammad was illiterate, but rather may simply identify him as a non-Jewish, non-Christian Arab.Hadith Evidence Suggesting Muhammad’s LiteracyIn addition to linguistic analysis, several authentic hadith reports imply Muhammad possessed at least basic literacy:The Treaty of Hudaybiyyah (Sahih al-Bukhari 2699)When negotiating with the Meccans, Muhammad is reported to have taken a treaty document and altered its text himself after a dispute about his prophetic title. The hadith records:\"Allah’s Messenger took the document and wrote: 'This is what Muhammad bin Abdullah has agreed upon…'\"(al-Bukhari, 2699).If accurate, this account directly contradicts the claim that Muhammad was incapable of writing.The Event of the Pen and Paper Before His Death (Sahih al-Bukhari 114; Sahih Muslim 1637a)Before his death, Muhammad reportedly asked for writing materials to write a statement to prevent the community from going astray:\"Bring me paper so that I may write for you a statement after which you will never go astray.\"(al-Bukhari, 114).The wording here implies his capacity to write, undermining claims of complete illiteracy.ConclusionThe claim of Muhammad’s illiteracy as a miraculous proof for the divine origin of the Qur’an is both theologically and historically problematic. First, Muhammad’s literacy status is irrelevant since the Qur’an was compiled as a written book only after his death. Second, linguistic evidence reveals thatummiyunmore appropriately refers to a gentile, not necessarily an illiterate person. Third, credible hadith traditions suggest Muhammad was at least capable of reading and writing.Therefore, the argument from illiteracy is neither a reliable proof of the Qur'an’s divine origin nor a historically uncontested fact. Rather, it is a theological assertion unsupported by conclusive textual or historical evidence.Referencesal-Bukhari, M. I. (n.d.).Sahih al-Bukhari. Hadith No. 114, 2699, 4986.Denny, F. M.

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractMuslim apologists often claim the Qur'an is a flawless, divinely authored scripture without contradictions, inconsistencies, or discrepancies. This assertion is rooted in Surah 4:82 and reiterated by classical Islamic scholars such as Ibn Kathir and contemporary translators like Yusuf Ali. However, a closer critical textual analysis reveals internal inconsistencies within the Qur'an’s narrative framework. This study focuses on one category of such contradictions: the identity of the 'first Muslim' according to different passages, which reveals a significant inconsistency within the text.1. IntroductionThe Qur'an, revered by Muslims as the final, unaltered word of God, explicitly claims to be free from contradiction. Surah 4:82 states:\"Do they not consider the Qur'an (with care)? Had it been from other than Allah, they would surely have found therein much discrepancy.\"(Surah 4:82, Yusuf Ali Translation)Classical exegeteIbn Kathirasserts that this verse establishes the Qur'an’s divine origin, claiming it contains no inconsistencies, conflicting statements, or discrepancies because it is a revelation from theMost-Wise, Most-Praised. Similarly,Yusuf Aliin his commentary emphasizes the Qur’an’s claim of textual coherence as a testament to its divine authorship.This study examines this claim by evaluating a notable contradiction within the Qur'an: the conflicting identification of who was the first Muslim.2. The Claim of Consistency in the Qur'anBoth classical and modern Islamic scholars affirm the Qur'an's consistency based on Surah 4:82. Yusuf Ali states:“The Qur'an claims to be a revelation from Allah, and the challenge is that if it were from any other source, it would contain many inconsistencies and contradictions, which no one can deny exist in any human composition. But in the Qur'an, no such inconsistencies exist. It is the perfect and coherent Book of Allah, remaining free from any contradiction, regardless of how many years it was revealed or the diverse subjects it covers.”This view represents the majority position in classical Islamic thought.3. Contradictory Claims About the First MuslimDespite the claims of consistency, a careful reading of the Qur'an reveals conflicting statements regarding who was thefirst Muslim. Several verses appear to assign this title to different figures:MuhammadSurah 39:12“And I (Muhammad) am commanded to be the first of those who submit (as Muslims).”Surah 6:163“No partner has He; this am I commanded, and I am the first of those who submit.”MosesSurah 7:143“When Moses came at the appointed time and place, and his Lord spoke to him, he said, ‘O my Lord, show Yourself to me, so I may look at You.’ … when he recovered, he said: ‘Glory be to You! I turn to You in repentance, and I am the first to believe.’”AbrahamSurah 2:132“And this was the legacy that Abraham left to his sons, and so did Jacob; ‘O my sons! Allah has chosen the Faith for you; so do not die except in the Faith of Islam.’”Each verse proclaims the subject as the 'first Muslim' or the first to submit to God’s will in Islam. This creates a theological and textual contradiction, as it is logically impossible for multiple, historically sequential figures to each bethe firstMuslim.4. Analysis of the ContradictionThis inconsistency raises critical questions about the claim made inSurah 4:82. If the Qur'an is entirely free from discrepancy, how can it declare multiple individuals, separated by centuries in Islamic tradition, as the ‘first’ Muslim?One may attempt to harmonize these verses by suggesting the phrase ‘first Muslim’ is metaphorical, contextual, or refers to a particular community or event. However, the straightforward reading in each passage indicates a definitive and literal first claim, making such reconciliations appear forced and exegetically weak.Moreover, the Qur’an portrays Islam not as a religion founded by Muhammad, but as the primordial faith of submission to God (as practiced by Abraham, Moses, and others). While this theological perspective could allow for contextual uses of 'first Muslim' in specific situations, the verses lack the necessary qualifiers, leading to an unavoidable tension within the text.5. Implications for the Qur’an’s Claim of ConsistencyIf, according toSurah 4:82, the presence of discrepancies would disqualify the Qur'an’s divine authorship, then these conflicting declarations undermine the very standard it sets for itself. As the Qur’an itself provides multiple claimants for the title offirst Muslim, it contradicts its claim of perfect internal consistency.This issue is not merely a matter of hermeneutics but strikes at the heart of the Qur'an’s self-authenticating claim of inerrancy.6. ConclusionThis analysis demonstrates that, contrary to the Qur'an’s claim inSurah 4:82and the assertions of classical and modern Islamic scholarship, internal contradictions do exist within the text. The case of multiple figures being designated as thefirst Muslimillustrates a clear textual inconsistency.As such, the Qur'an’s claim to be entirely free of contradiction must be reconsidered in light of these findings. This study represents the first installment in a broader critical examination of Qur'anic consistency, which will continue in subsequent analyses.Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

    "full_content": "Muhammad and Satanic Influence in Islamic Texts: A Critical ExaminationDr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis paper critically examines key Islamic primary sources and early biographical materials that suggest episodes of satanic influence upon Muhammad, the prophet of Islam. By analyzing authenticated hadith collections, classical biographies, and relevant Qur'anic verses, this study investigates claims of satanic intervention in the prophetic experiences of Muhammad, contrasting these accounts with Biblical theology. The study also draws theological parallels between the character of Allah in the Qur'an and the Biblical description of Satan, providing a foundation for further interfaith apologetic dialogue.A. The Nature of Muhammad’s Revelations1. Divine Inspiration as a Ringing BellInSahih Al-Bukhari(Vol. 4, Book 54, Hadith no. 438), Aisha narrates how Muhammad described the mechanism of divine inspiration. He confessed that sometimes it resembled the sound of a ringing bell — a description of supernatural communication that finds no parallel in Biblical prophetic tradition:“The Angel sometimes comes to me with a voice which resembles the sound of a ringing bell, and when this state abandons me, I remember what the Angel has said, and this type of Divine Inspiration is the hardest on me…”This peculiar phenomenon warrants scrutiny, particularly in light of Muhammad’s own aversion to bells elsewhere in Islamic tradition.B. Bells and Satanic AssociationsInSunan Abu Dawud(Book 34, Hadith no. 4218), Muhammad explicitly condemns the use of bells, claiming:“Women cannot wear bells on their legs. There is a devil along with each bell.”The contradiction between the medium of Muhammad’s claimed revelation and his own assertion of bells’ satanic association raises a critical theological dilemma.C. Satanic Revelation in Early Islam1. Satan as the Source of RevelationAccording toUmdah al-Ahkam(Vol. 3, Hadith no. 460), a disturbing tradition suggests:“Allah was Satan in the form of an angel that revealed to me the verses and his book the Quran and I am his prophet.”Though this narration is contested in isnād authenticity by many Muslim scholars, its very circulation within early Islamic discourse reveals theological anxieties about the source of Muhammad’s revelations.2. The Incident of the Satanic VersesThe most infamous episode appears inThe Life of Muhammadby Ibn Ishaq (pp. 165–167) and is corroborated byal-Tabariand others. Muhammad, while recitingSurah an-Najm(Qur'an 53:1-20), allegedly spoke favorably of pagan deities al-Lāt, al-‘Uzzā, and Manāt:“These are the exalted cranes (gharānīq) whose intercession is to be hoped for.”This utterance, later acknowledged by Gabriel as satanic interpolation, profoundly impacted early Islam. Qur'an 22:52 later attempted to theologically sanitize the event:“Never did We send a Messenger or a Prophet before you, but when he did recite the revelation, Satan threw some (falsehood) in it. But Allah abolishes that which Satan throws in…”Theologically, this episode undermines the Islamic claim of incorruptible prophetic transmission.D. Paradoxical Marriages in ParadiseInSunan Ibn Majah(Zuhd 39), Muhammad claimed:“Everyone that Allah admits into Paradise will be married to seventy-two wives: two of them houris and seventy of his inheritance from the dwellers of Hell…”This disturbing eschatological teaching suggests sexual relations between Paradise dwellers and women from Hell, challenging the moral coherence of Islamic paradise and further implicating a potential collusion between Hell and Heaven.E. Allah as “The Best of Deceivers”InQur'an 3:54, Allah is described as:“The best of deceivers (makireena).”Biblical theology reserves the title of deceiver for Satan alone (Revelation 12:9):“And the great dragon was hurled down — that ancient serpent called the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world.”The moral character of a deity self-described as a deceiver starkly contrasts with the immutable, holy nature of the God of the Bible.F. Muhammad’s Encounter with a Possessed WomanAccording toSunan Al Daraqutni(Vol. 1, p. 739):“A woman possessed by the devil claimed, ‘I am Allah,’ and Muhammad, frightened, fled from her.”The prophet’s reaction to demonic possession, coupled with the entity’s claim of divinity, raises disturbing implications about Muhammad's perception of the supernatural.G. Muhammad’s “Satan” Abandoning HimInSahih Bukhari(Vol. 6, Book 60, Hadith no. 475), it is recorded:“O Muhammad! I think that your Satan has forsaken you, for I have not seen him with you for two or three nights.”This was in reference to the temporary lapse in Muhammad’s revelations, leading to the subsequent Qur'anic reassurance (Qur'an 93:1-3). The accusation that Muhammad was accompanied by a personal Satan was not refuted, but instead dismissed by an appeal to revelation — a weak apologetic defense.ConclusionThe Islamic primary sources themselves, when examined critically and comparatively, demonstrate troubling accounts of satanic influence on Muhammad's prophetic claims. The contradictions within Islamic tradition, particularly regarding divine communication, the Satanic verses incident, and the moral attributes ascribed to Allah, call into question the reliability of Muhammad’s prophethood. The Biblical standard of prophetic consistency, moral holiness, and unassailable divine nature stands in sharp contrast to the theological inconsistencies evident in early Islam.ReferencesSahih Al-Bukhari, Vol. 4, Book 54, Hadith no. 438Sunan Abu Dawud, Book 34, Hadith no. 4218Umdah al-Ahkam, Vol. 3, Hadith no. 460Ibn Ishaq,The Life of Muhammad, pp. 165-167Qur'an 22:52,The Noble Qur’anSunan Ibn Majah, Zuhd 39Qur'an 3:54,The Noble Qur’anRevelation 12:9,The Holy BibleSunan Al Daraqutni, Vol. 1, p. 739Sahih Bukhari, Vol. 6, Book 60, Hadith no. 475",

    "full_content": "Allah and Muhammad Declared That the Bible Is Truth: A Theological ExaminationBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteAbstractMuslim apologists often claim that the Bible has been corrupted over time. However, a careful examination of the Qur'an and early Islamic traditions reveals that both Allah and Muhammad acknowledged the Torah and the Gospel (Injeel) as divine revelations and sources of truth. This paper presents a systematic compilation of Qur'anic verses and Hadith references affirming the authenticity of the earlier Scriptures, thereby challenging the popular claim of biblical corruption within Islamic polemics.1. Affirmation of Earlier Revelations in the Qur'anThe Qur'an repeatedly emphasizes the continuity of divine revelation, placing the Torah, Psalms, and Gospel within the same sacred lineage as the Qur'an. Several passages explicitly command belief in the Scriptures given to previous prophets.Qur'an 2:136“Say [O believers], ‘We have believed in Allah and what has been revealed to us and what has been revealed to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the Descendants and what was given to Moses and Jesus and what was given to the prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and we are Muslims [in submission] to Him.’”Qur'an 2:4“And who believe in what has been sent down to you [Muhammad], and in what was sent down before you, and they believe with certainty in the Hereafter.”These verses affirm the revealed status of the earlier Scriptures and command Muslims to believe in them without distinction.2. Qur'anic Testimony to the Validity of the Torah and GospelThe Qur'an not only acknowledges the previous Scriptures but also presents them as ongoing authorities for the People of the Book.Qur'an 3:2–3“Allah – there is no deity except Him, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of existence. He has sent down upon you [O Muhammad], the Book in truth, confirming what was before it. And He revealed the Torah and the Gospel.”Qur'an 4:136“O you who have believed, believe in Allah and His Messenger and the Book that He sent down upon His Messenger and the Scripture which He sent down before.”These passages confirm both the Qur'an and the prior Scriptures as authoritative revelations from the same divine source.3. Command to Judge by the Torah and GospelIn a striking affirmation, the Qur'an instructs the People of the Book to judge by their Scriptures, implying their reliability and authority at the time of Muhammad.Qur'an 5:47“And let the People of the Gospel judge by what Allah has revealed therein. And whoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed – then it is those who are the defiantly disobedient.”Qur'an 5:68“Say, ‘O People of the Scripture, you have no ground to stand upon unless you uphold the Torah, the Gospel, and what has been revealed to you from your Lord.’”These verses would have been meaningless if the Scriptures had been corrupted, for no Prophet of God would command judgment by a falsified text.4. The Qur'an’s Recognition of the People of the BookSeveral Qur'anic passages acknowledge the People of the Book and recognize the unity of God worshipped by both communities.Qur'an 29:46“And do not argue with the People of the Scripture except in a way that is best… and say, ‘We believe in that which has been revealed to us and revealed to you. And our God and your God is one; and we are Muslims [in submission] to Him.’”This intertextual acknowledgment presumes the Scriptures of the People of the Book retained their validity.5. Confirmation of the Torah by MuhammadThe Hadith literature provides a remarkable episode where Muhammad personally affirmed the truth of the Torah.Sunan Abu Dawud, Book 38, Number 4434“A group of Jews came and invited the Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) to Quff. They said: AbulQasim, one of our men has committed fornication. They placed a cushion for the Apostle of Allah who sat on it and said: ‘Bring the Torah.’ It was then brought. He then withdrew the cushion from beneath him and placed the Torah on it saying: ‘I believed in thee and in Him Who revealed thee.’”This authentic narration affirms Muhammad’s recognition of the Torah’s authority.6. Waraqa bin Nawfal and the GospelAnother significant testimony comes from the early Islamic tradition, which records the involvement of Waraqa bin Nawfal, a Christian relative of Khadijah, in translating the Gospel into Arabic.Sahih al-Bukhari 4953“Waraqa had been converted to Christianity in the pre-Islamic period and used to write the Gospel in Arabic as much as Allah wished him to write.”The reverence shown to the Gospel here reflects its perceived sacred status in early Islamic narratives.7. Jesus’ Confirmation of the TorahEven within the Qur'anic portrayal of Jesus, he is presented as confirming the Torah and announcing further divine guidance.Qur'an 61:6“And when Jesus son of Mary said: ‘O Children of Israel! Lo! I am the messenger of Allah unto you, confirming that which was before me in the Torah, and bringing good tidings of a messenger who shall come after me, whose name is Ahmad.’”This testimony reflects continuity, not corruption, of the previous Scriptures.ConclusionThe Qur'anic affirmations and early Islamic traditions reveal a consistent acknowledgment of the Torah and Gospel as authentic, divine revelations. These texts are portrayed as valid during the lifetime of Muhammad and even commanded as legal authorities for their respective communities. This evidence fundamentally challenges the later Islamic polemic that the Bible has been irredeemably corrupted. A faithful reading of the Qur'an and Hadith requires acknowledging the Torah and Gospel as reliable Scriptures within the Islamic prophetic tradition.ReferencesThe Qur'an: Surahs 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 21, 29, 61Sahih al-Bukhari, Hadith 4953Sunan Abu Dawud, Book 38, Number 4434",

    "full_content": "The Missing Baptism: A Critical Theological Challenge to the Qur'anic Representation of Yahya (John the Baptist)By Dr. Maxwell Shimba | Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractWhile the Qur'an claims to affirm the Torah, the Psalms, and the Gospel, significant theological practices such as baptism — foundational in the biblical narrative through the ministry of John the Baptist — are conspicuously absent from the Islamic scripture and practice. This article critically examines the portrayal of Yahya (John the Baptist) in the Qur'an, his omission as a baptizer, and the broader Islamic rejection of baptism, exposing this as a fundamental failure of the Qur'an to substantiate its claim as a confirmation of prior divine revelation. Moreover, it interrogates the credibility of Muhammad’s prophethood against the biblical and prophetic tradition, highlighting Islam’s theological gaps and inconsistencies.IntroductionIslam asserts that the Qur'an was sent as a confirmation of the scriptures before it — namely the Torah (Tawrat), Psalms (Zabur), and Gospel (Injil). However, one of the profound practices attested to in both the Old and New Testaments —baptism— finds no place in the Qur'an nor in the practice of Prophet Muhammad. Even more perplexing is the Qur'anic mention of Yahya (John the Baptist), a figure known exclusively in biblical history for his ministry of baptism, without a single reference to his baptizing mission. This theological inconsistency raises critical questions about the reliability of the Qur'anic narrative and its authenticity as divine revelation.The Absence of Baptism in the Qur'anThe Bible unmistakably records John the Baptist as “the voice of one crying in the wilderness” (Isaiah 40:3; Matthew 3:3), who baptized multitudes and notably Jesus Christ himself (Matthew 3:13-17). Baptism was a profound symbol of repentance and spiritual renewal, central to John’s prophetic office.Yet, the Qur'an — despite mentioning Yahya multiple times (Qur'an 19:7-15; 3:39) — is entirely silent on his role as a baptizer. This omission is deeply problematic. If the Qur'an is truly a confirmation of the Gospel, why does it fail to affirm one of the most public, prophetic, and messianic acts in Christian theology: the baptism of Jesus by John?Furthermore,baptism is absent as a religious rite in Islam. No command, narrative, or practice of baptism exists in the Qur'an, nor was Muhammad himself baptized, a stark divergence from the prophetic pattern in which Jesus partook of baptism, and His disciples continued the practice (Acts 2:38-41).This silence leads to a series of theological and historical questions:Why does Yahya not baptize in the Qur'an if he is the same historical person as John the Baptist?Why is baptism neither preserved nor practiced in Islam if the Qur'an claims to affirm the Gospel?Why did Muhammad, whom Muslims claim to be the seal of prophets, not undergo baptism?Why is there no record of baptism among Muhammad’s followers in the earliest Islamic community?These questions reveal severe discontinuity between the biblical and Qur'anic narratives, undermining the Qur'an’s claim to authenticate prior revelations.The Puzzling Name ‘Yahya’ — A Non-Historical AnomalyAnother significant concern is the name‘Yahya’itself. The Qur'an names John the Baptist asYahya, a designationabsent from the Hebrew Bible, Jewish historical records, or even Christian texts. The biblical and historical name isYochananin Hebrew, translatedJohnin English, andYuhannain Arabic — a name preserved in the Arabic Bible to this day.This anomaly raises pressing historical and philological questions:What is the origin of the name Yahya?Why is it unknown in Jewish and Christian records, including ancient Aramaic, Hebrew, Greek, and even early Arabic Christian writings?Why did the Qur'an introduce a non-historical name while claiming to recount the same prophetic history?Such discrepancies suggest that the Qur'anic authors may have lacked direct knowledge of biblical texts or relied on altered oral traditions, further casting doubt on the Qur'an's claim of confirming prior scripture.Theological Incoherence: If Yahya Was a Muslim, Why No Baptism in Islam?Muslim exegetes claim all biblical prophets were Muslims, including Yahya. If so, why was Yahya’s defining prophetic act — baptism — neither continued nor affirmed in Islam? Why did Prophet Muhammad, regarded as the seal of the prophets, not institute baptism as part of Islamic ritual, especially when he claimed to follow the prophetic traditions?The Qur'an’s failure to even acknowledge baptism exposes a theological inconsistency:If Yahya was a Muslim prophet, as Islam claims, why did he baptize while other Muslim prophets allegedly did not?Why did this practice, supposedly divinely sanctioned, vanish entirely by the time of Muhammad?How does the absence of baptism reconcile with Islam’s claim of confirming the Gospel when baptism was central to Jesus’s ministry (Mark 1:9-11) and commanded to His disciples (Matthew 28:19)?This theological incoherence suggests either a historical break between Islam and authentic biblical tradition or that Islam emerged independently, borrowing selectively from biblical narratives without preserving their core theological meanings.Conclusion: An Unsubstantiated Claim of ContinuityThe absence of baptism in Islam — both in scripture and practice — alongside the historically untraceable name ‘Yahya’ and the omission of John the Baptist’s defining ministry, exposes a fatal flaw in the Qur'an’s claim to confirm previous revelations. Muhammad’s prophetic credentials further suffer when contrasted against biblical standards, as he neither underwent baptism nor acknowledged it as a divine ordinance.This glaring omission reveals thatthe Qur'an is neither a faithful confirmation of the Gospel nor a continuation of the authentic prophetic tradition. Instead, it selectively appropriates biblical figures while detaching them from their historical and theological contexts.In this light, the Qur'an’s claim to divine origin becomes increasingly untenable. It fails to meet the very standards it sets for itself — to affirm the prior books — and thereby exposes itself, and Muhammad, as inconsistent with the tradition it professes to uphold.ReferencesThe Holy Bible, New International Version.The Qur'an (Translations by Yusuf Ali, Pickthall, and Sahih International)Encyclopaedia Judaica, “John the Baptist”Geisler, Norman L. & Saleeb, Abdul.Answering Islam: The Crescent in Light of the CrossGuillaume, A.The Life of Muhammad: A Translation of Ibn Ishaq's Sirat Rasul Allah",

    "full_content": "The Incompleteness and Unreliability of the Quran: A Critical Analysis of Textual Gaps and Hadith DependencyBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThe Quran, revered by Muslims as the final and perfect revelation of Allah, asserts itself as a complete, clear, and detailed book for guidance. However, a closer academic analysis exposes significant textual gaps, ambiguities, and the need for external sources — primarily the Hadith — to clarify essential doctrines, laws, and historical narratives. This paper critically examines one such case: the narrative of Adam’s sons, their identities, actions, and familial relations, as well as the Quran’s silence on critical details. Furthermore, it interrogates whether the Quran itself mandates the use of Hadith, concluding it does not. This article contends that the Quran is incomplete for doctrinal and historical instruction and ultimately unreliable as a self-sufficient religious text.IntroductionThe Islamic tradition holds that the Quran is“a book wherein there is no doubt, a guidance for the righteous”(Quran 2:2). It frequently claims to confirm prior scriptures (Torah, Psalms, Gospel) and asserts to be a comprehensive record of divine will. Yet, modern and classical scholars have long debated its sufficiency and clarity when detached from the Hadith corpus. Among the most glaring examples of these deficiencies is the narrative ofAdam's sons. Unlike the Bible, which clearly identifies them asCain and Abel (Genesis 4:1-8), the Quran omits their names and key contextual details.The Case of Adam’s Sons: Missing Names and DetailsIn the Quran, the story of Adam's sons is briefly mentioned inSurah Al-Ma'idah (5:27-31):“And recite to them the story of Adam's two sons, in truth, when they both offered a sacrifice, and it was accepted from one of them but not from the other. Said (the latter), ‘I will surely kill you.’ Said (the former), ‘Indeed, Allah only accepts from the righteous.’”(5:27)This passage confirms neither the names of these sons nor their mother’s identity. By contrast, in theBible— considered part of the prior revelations Islam claims to affirm — their names areCain and Abel, and their mother isEve(Genesis 4:1-2).The Quran fails to mention:The names of Adam’s sons.The identity of their mother.The specific type of sacrifices offered.The motive behind the rejection and murder.The actual act of killing.These vital details are instead supplied byHadithliterature and theTafsir (commentaries), drawn largely fromBiblical narrativesandJewish oral traditions (Isra'iliyyat). This dependence suggests the Quran alone is insufficient for understanding even basic historical events it mentions.Who Killed Whom? According to the QuranWithinSurah 5:27-31, it’s indicated that one son killed the other due to jealousy after a sacrifice was accepted by Allah from one but rejected from the other. However, thenames of the perpetrator and victim are entirely absent. Islamic exegetes universally agree, based onHadith and Biblical borrowing, thatQabil (Cain)killedHabil (Abel).But importantly —the Quran itself never names them. This silence is critical. A supposedly clear and detailed book (Quran 12:111; 16:89) leaves out core identifiers in a pivotal moral narrative.The Identity of Their Mother in the QuranSimilarly, the Quran does not mentionEve (Hawwa)by nameanywhere. She is only indirectly referred to as Adam’s \"mate\" (Quran 7:19, 20:117). This contrasts sharply with the Bible’s clarity in Genesis 3:20. Islamic scholars compensate for this by relying on Hadith and Jewish traditions.Is the Use of Hadith Authorized by the Quran?Despite the indispensable role ofHadithin explaining Quranic ambiguities, the Quran itselfnever instructs Muslims to refer to Hadith for religious or legal authority. The Quran insists it is“fully detailed”(6:114, 12:111) and “complete” (5:3).Yet, Islamic jurisprudence and theology lean heavily onHadith collections(e.g., Sahih al-Bukhari, Sahih Muslim) for:Details on daily prayers (number, method, timings)Ritual acts like Hajj and ZakatCriminal lawHistorical narratives like Adam’s sonsThis reliance reveals a contradiction: a text claiming completeness yet requiring supplementary literature for interpretation and application.Nowhere in the Quran does Allah command Muslims to read, follow, or preserve Hadith literature.The word‘Hadith’in the Quran typically refers to a “narration” or “story” and is even warned against in several verses when it distracts from Allah’s revelations (e.g., 31:6).Quran’s Claim to Affirm Prior Books and Its FailureThe Quran claims to affirm and confirm the Torah, Psalms, and Gospel (e.g., 5:46, 5:48). Yet, it diverges significantly in both narrative details and theological conclusions. The Adam’s sons narrative is a prime example — lacking names and details found clearly in Genesis 4.Further, the Quran denounces the Bible as corrupted (e.g., 2:79), while simultaneously claiming to confirm it. This creates a theological inconsistency: affirming a revelation it accuses of being unreliable, while depending on it indirectly throughHadithandIsra'iliyyattraditions.ConclusionThis academic review of the Quran’s handling of the Adam’s sons narrative demonstrates a broader issue: the Quran is incomplete as a self-sufficient religious text. Its gaps necessitate external sources, especially Hadith, for clarification. Moreover, nowhere does the Quran command the preservation or authority of Hadith literature.The logical conclusion is that Islam’s foundational text cannot stand independently. It is neither a fully detailed account nor a consistent confirmation of prior scriptures, as it claims. This renders the Quran anunreliable and incomplete source for comprehensive theological, legal, or historical guidance.ReferencesQuran 2:2, 5:3, 5:27-31, 6:114, 12:111, 16:89, 31:6Genesis 4:1-8, 3:20Sahih al-Bukhari, Sahih MuslimAl-Tabari,Tafsir al-TabariAl-Qurtubi,Tafsir al-QurtubiGoldziher, Ignác.Muhammedanische Studien(1889)Wansbrough, John.Quranic Studies: Sources and Methods of Scriptural Interpretation(1977)",

    "full_content": "A Contradiction Within the QuranBy Dr. Max ShimbaMax Shimba MinistriesIntroductionThis issue represents a significant theological discrepancy within Islamic scripture — a contradiction between the historical record preserved in the Hebrew Bible and the later narrative presented in the Quran. The core question is simple yet deeply consequential for scriptural integrity:Who rescued Moses from the Nile — Pharaoh’s daughter or Pharaoh’s wife?The Biblical AccountAccording to the Holy Bible, when Pharaoh sought to kill all Hebrew male infants, God intervened to save Moses by causing Pharaoh’sdaughterto adopt the child and raise him as her own. The account is clearly detailed in the book of Exodus:\"And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi. And the woman conceived, and bore a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months. And when she could no longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river’s brink. And his sister stood afar off, to see what would be done to him. And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river’s side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it. And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, 'This is one of the Hebrews' children.' Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, 'Shall I go and call thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?' And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, 'Go.' And the maid went and called the child’s mother. And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, 'Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages.' And the woman took the child, and nursed it. And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, 'Because I drew him out of the water.'\"—Exodus 2:1–10 (KJV)This is affirmed again in the New Testament:\"And when he was cast out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son.\"—Acts 7:21 (KJV)The Quranic AccountOver two millennia later, the Quran presents a conflicting version of this historical episode, asserting that it wasPharaoh's wife— not his daughter — who rescued and adopted Moses. The Quran states:\"And We inspired the mother of Moses, saying: 'Suckle him, and when thou fearest for him, then cast him into the river and fear not, nor grieve. Lo! We shall bring him back unto thee, and shall make him (one) of Our messengers.' And the family of Pharaoh took him up, that he might become for them an enemy and a sorrow. Lo! Pharaoh and Haman and their hosts were ever sinning. And the wife of Pharaoh said: 'A comfort for me and for thee! Kill him not. He may be of use to us, or we may adopt him as a son.' And they perceived not.\"—Surah 28:7–9 (Pickthall Translation)Here, it is explicitly Pharaoh'swifewho intervenes and claims the infant Moses.Evaluating the ContradictionGiven that the Hebrew Bible, authored by Moses himself (according to longstanding Jewish and Christian tradition), was written far closer to the time of these events, it would logically hold greater historical reliability. The Israelites, as direct participants and custodians of their national history, would certainly have accurately preserved the identity of Moses' rescuer.Additionally, the Quran itself instructs Muslims to consult the People of the Book (Jews and Christians) regarding earlier revelations and sacred history:\"And if you (Muhammad) are in doubt concerning that which We reveal unto you, then ask those who read the Scripture (that was) before you. Verily the Truth from your Lord has come unto you. So be not of the doubters.\"—Surah 10:94 (Pickthall)\"And verily We gave unto Moses nine clear signs. Ask the Children of Israel how he came unto them, and Pharaoh said unto him: 'Lo! I deem thee one bewitched, O Moses.'\"—Surah 17:101 (Shakir)Further, the Quran claims that Jesus himself confirmed the authority of the Hebrew Torah available in his day:\"He will teach him the Scripture and wisdom, and the Torah and the Gospel.\" ... \"'And (I have come) confirming that which was before me of the Torah and to make lawful for you some of what was forbidden to you. I have come to you with a sign from your Lord. So fear God and obey me.'\"—Surah 3:47, 49 (Khalifa)\"And in their footsteps, We sent Jesus son of Mary, confirming the Torah that came before him; and We gave him the Gospel, wherein is guidance and light, and confirming the Torah that preceded it, a guidance and an admonition for the righteous.\"—Surah 5:46 (Khalifa)ConclusionGiven the corroborative testimony of the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament, and even Quranic endorsements of these scriptures, it becomes clear that the biblical account — which identifies Pharaoh’sdaughteras Moses' rescuer — is historically and theologically sound.In contrast, the Quran’s claim that it was Pharaoh’swiferepresents a critical historical error, undermining its claim to confirm previous scriptures.As a result, we must conclude that:The Holy Bible remains historically consistent and theologically reliable.The Quran’s contradiction on this matter reveals its fallibility as a later historical source.Shalom.Dr. Max ShimbaMax Shimba Ministries",

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaMax Shimba MinistriesIntroductionIt is often observed that Muslims criticize Christians for praying while wearing shoes inside their churches. The question arises — did the Prophet of Islam, Muhammad, himself pray with his shoes on while inside the mosque? In this paper, we examine this issue using primary Islamic sources and authenticated Hadith compilations to evaluate the practice of the Prophet and the instruction he gave regarding footwear during prayer.Prophet Muhammad’s Practice of Praying with ShoesAccording to several Hadith reports, Prophet Muhammad indeed prayed with his shoes on inside the mosque. This is evident in the narration found in the bookAl-Ulu wal-Marjan:“Permission to pray with shoes.”Anas bin Malik (R.A) narrated from Sa‘id bin Yazid Al-Azdi (R.A), who said:“I asked Anas bin Malik (R.A), ‘Did the Prophet (S.A.W) pray while wearing his shoes?’ He replied, ‘Yes.’”—(Al-Bukhari, Hadith No. 383, Vol. 1)This narration explicitly indicates that Prophet Muhammad performed prayers while wearing his shoes, and a specific chapter title in this collection grants permission for such a practice.Instructions Regarding Cleanliness of ShoesThe Prophet not only prayed with his shoes on but also gave instructions to his followers concerning the cleanliness of their footwear before prayer. This is recorded inBulugh al-Maram min Jam’i Adillatil Ahkam:Hadith No. 171:Abu Sa‘id Al-Khudri (R.A) reported that the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) said:“When any one of you comes to the mosque, let him look at his shoes. If he finds filth (najasah) on them, let him wipe them off and then pray in them.”—(Reported by Abu Dawood, Ibn Khuzaymah graded it Sahih)The commentary explains that if someone steps on filth with their shoes, they can purify them by rubbing them against the ground or soil until the impurity is removed.Further Instruction Regarding Shoes and Safety in the MosqueAn additional narration shows that Prophet Muhammad expected worshippers to have their shoes available during prayer for practical reasons. In a situation involving a scorpion inside the mosque, the Prophet instructed:“Whoever amongst you sees a scorpion while praying should kill it with his left shoe.”—(Mkweli Mwaminifu, Vol. 1-2, Hadith No. 188, p. 88)This command implies that Muslims would have their shoes on or immediately accessible even while engaged in prayer.DiscussionThe consistent theme from these narrations is that the Prophet of Islam not only allowed but also performed prayer while wearing shoes, as long as they were clean. The practice of removing shoes before prayer was a later custom influenced by differing cultural and environmental factors, particularly as mosques began using rugs and carpets.Consequently, it appears inconsistent when Muslims criticize Christians for praying while wearing shoes in church buildings, especially when the founder of their own faith engaged in the practice and instructed others to do so.The critique here is not merely about footwear etiquette but about the double standards in religious polemics. If the Prophet prayed in shoes and permitted it conditionally, it undermines the argument that Christian practices of praying with shoes are impure or disrespectful.ConclusionThis study of primary Islamic texts confirms that Prophet Muhammad did pray in his shoes within the mosque and allowed his followers to do the same, provided their shoes were clean. Thus, the polemic against Christians praying with shoes appears to be unfounded, especially in light of these authenticated narrations.ReferencesAl-Bukhari, Muhammad ibn Ismail.Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 1, Hadith No. 383.Ibn Hajar Al-Asqalani.Bulugh al-Maram min Jam’i Adillatil Ahkam.

All Rights ReservedIntroductionEvery religious adherent believes in the existence of a supreme being responsible for the creation of humanity, animals, the visible and invisible worlds. However, it is worth examining what both Yehovah, the God of the Bible, and Allah, the deity described in the Qur’an, claim about creation. Do their statements align or conflict? Whose image was man created in?This paper aims to provide a comparative theological examination between the Biblical and Qur’anic declarations regarding the Creator, presenting a scholarly analysis of both sources to ascertain the nature of the divine being responsible for creation.Allah’s Declaration about HimselfThe Qur’an makes the following assertion:Qur’an 112:1-4 (Suratul Al-Ikhlas)“Say: He is Allah, the One and Only. Allah, the Eternal, Absolute. He begets not, nor is He begotten. And there is none like unto Him.”According to this passage, Allah affirms that he neither begets nor is begotten and explicitly states that no one is like him.Yehovah’s Declaration about HimselfConversely, the Bible records:Genesis 1:26-27 (KJV)\"And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.\"Here, Yehovah declares that mankind was made in His image and likeness. This sharply contrasts with the Qur’anic claim where Allah declares that no one is like him.Additional Biblical Texts Affirming Man’s Divine LikenessGenesis 5:1-2Genesis 9:61 Corinthians 11:7Colossians 1:15; 3:10Acts 17:28-29James 3:9While some might inquire how God resembles humanity, the Scriptures clarify that God is spirit (John 4:24), and He breathed into man the breath of life (Genesis 2:7). He is also the Father of our spirits (Hebrews 12:9) and claims ownership over all souls (Ezekiel 18:4; Numbers 16:22).Swearing by Creation: Allah versus YehovahAllah’s OathsThe Qur’an records several instances of Allah swearing by His creation:Qur’an 91:1-7 (Suratul Ash-Shams)“By the sun and its brightness, by the moon as it follows it, by the day as it displays it, by the night as it covers it, by the heaven and Him who built it, by the earth and Him who spread it out, and by the soul and Him who perfected it.”Qur’an 92:1-3 (Suratul Al-Layl)“By the night as it envelops, by the day as it appears, and by Him who created male and female.”Here, Allah swears by the created order, something foreign to the Biblical God, Yehovah.Yehovah’s Solemn OathsIsaiah 45:22-23 (KJV)“Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else.I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, That unto me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.”Hebrews 6:13-16 (KJV)“For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself,Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife.”Unlike Allah, Yehovah swears solely by Himself, as He alone is supreme and uncreated (see also Isaiah 14:24; Genesis 22:16).Creator of the Heavens and the Earth: Allah’s and Yehovah’s ClaimsQur’an 45:22 (Surat Al-Jathiyah)“And Allah created the heavens and the earth with truth…”Qur’an 44:7-8 (Surat Ad-Dukhan)“The Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them, if you should be convinced. There is no deity except Him; He gives life and causes death — your Lord and the Lord of your first forefathers.”Isaiah 44:24 (KJV)“Thus saith the LORD, thy redeemer, and he that formed thee from the womb, I am the LORD that maketh all things; that stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself.”Isaiah 45:6-7, 11-12; Jeremiah 27:5Further affirmations declare Yehovah as the sole Creator of heaven and earth.ConclusionThe theological distinctions between the Biblical Yehovah and the Qur’anic Allah are significant. While both claim to be the Creator, their nature, method of swearing, and relationship to humanity fundamentally differ. Yehovah creates man in His image, swears by Himself alone, and consistently affirms His personal involvement in creation. Allah, conversely, denies resemblance to His creation and swears by created things, marking a clear divergence in divine nature and theology.ReferencesThe Holy Bible, King James Version (KJV)The Qur’an, Abdullah Yusuf Ali TranslationJohn 4:24Genesis 1:26-27; 2:7; 5:1-2; 9:6Isaiah 44:24; 45:6-7, 11-12; 14:24Hebrews 6:13-16; 12:9Ezekiel 18:4Numbers 16:221 Corinthians 11:7Colossians 1:15; 3:10Acts 17:28-29James 3:9In His Service,Dr. Maxwell ShimbaMax Shimba Ministries Org ©2015",

Utilizing primary Islamic sources, notably the Hadith literature, and biblical texts, this study explores the doctrinal implications of the afterlife in both traditions. The article concludes by highlighting the divergent eschatological promises of Allah and Elohim (Yahweh) and discusses their theological and soteriological consequences.IntroductionThe concept of life after death is central to both Islamic and Christian theology. However, the respective eschatological promises presented by the Qur’anic Allah and the Biblical Elohim exhibit significant doctrinal divergences. While Christian theology affirms immediate assurance of salvation and eternal life upon faith in Jesus Christ (John 5:24; 1 John 5:11-13), Islamic traditions, particularly Hadith literature, depict a complex and uncertain postmortem journey even for devout Muslims, including Muhammad himself.This study examines key Hadith narratives to evaluate Muhammad’s eschatological expectations and contrasts them with the Biblical assurance of eternal life, drawing a theological distinction between Allah and Elohim.Islamic Eschatology in Hadith LiteratureOne of the most revealing Hadiths concerning the eschatological destiny of Muhammad is found inSahih al-Bukhari(Vol. 1, Book 12, Hadith 770):“Then Allah will come to them again and say, ‘I am your Lord.’ They will say, ‘You are our Lord.’ Allah will call them, and As-Sirat (a bridge) will be laid across Hell and I (Muhammad) shall be the first amongst the Apostles to cross it with my followers... and some of them will fall and stay in Hell forever.” (Al-Bukhari, 1997)This Hadith explicitly states that Muhammad himself awaits the Day of Judgment to cross As-Sirat into Paradise, a fate that contrasts sharply with Biblical prophets who, according to Scripture, secured their eternal destinies during their earthly lives (Psalm 23:6; Isaiah 38:17-18).Furthermore,Sahih al-Bukhari(Vol. 1, Book 8, Hadith 345) narrates Muhammad’s claim of a visionary ascent into heaven where he allegedly encountered Adam, Moses, Jesus, and Abraham while still alive. Yet, paradoxically, Islamic eschatology postpones his final admission into Paradise until the Day of Judgment.Biblical Theology of Salvation and Eternal LifeIn contrast, the Bible emphasizes the immediacy and certainty of salvation for believers. Isaiah 38:17-18 and Psalm 51:12 articulate Old Testament assurances of forgiveness and eternal life within one’s earthly existence. The New Testament expands on this doctrine:\"Most assuredly, I say to you, he who hears My word and believes in Him who sent Me has everlasting life and shall not come into judgment but has passed from death into life.\" (John 5:24, NKJV)Jesus' declaration underscores the immediacy of eternal life for believers without the intermediary of hellfire or a postmortem bridge. Moreover, in John 4:10 and John 7:38, Jesus promises the 'living water' (Holy Spirit) to believers in their earthly lives, affirming salvation as a present reality.Doctrinal Contradictions and Theological ImplicationsThe cited Hadiths suggest that even monotheistic Muslims are consigned to Hell temporarily, to be identified and rescued by angels based on the marks of prostration (sujud).Sahih al-Bukharistates:\"He will order the angels to take out of Hell those who worshipped none but Him alone… So they will come out of the Fire as mere skeletons. The Water of Life will be poured on them.\" (Al-Bukhari, 1997)This conditional posthumous mercy starkly contrasts with Christian soteriology, which offers the assurance of immediate postmortem communion with God (Luke 23:43). The theological implication is clear: the Qur’anic Allah provides no definitive assurance of eternal life before death, unlike the Biblical Elohim.ConclusionThis comparative analysis reveals a profound theological and eschatological divergence between Islamic and Christian doctrines of the afterlife. The Hadith literature portrays a precarious postmortem future for even the most devout Muslims, including Muhammad. In contrast, the Bible guarantees eternal life and salvation in the present life for those who accept Jesus Christ. This doctrinal contrast necessitates a critical reflection on the nature of divine promises and their implications for believers.ReferencesAl-Bukhari, M. I. (1997).Sahih al-Bukhari(Vol. 1).

Today, I intend to provide several examples as evidence that Allah, as portrayed in Islamic texts, possesses anthropomorphic attributes akin to those of human beings. Let us embark on this inquiry together, examining this matter through the Quran, Hadith, and classical Islamic literature.1. Allah Acknowledges Having a Face (Wajh)The Quran explicitly refers to the 'face' of Allah:\"To Allah belong the East and the West. So wherever you turn, there is the Face of Allah. Indeed, Allah is all-Encompassing and Knowing.\" (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:115)In this verse, Allah is said to possess a 'face' (Arabic:wajh), which implies an anthropomorphic feature. Is having a 'face' not a characteristic of created beings?Additionally:\"Everything will perish except His Face.\" (Surah Al-Qasas 28:88)Again, Allah claims that only His 'face' will remain after the annihilation of all else. This explicit claim implies that Allah has a literal face.2. Allah’s Eyes and TearsClassical Islamic literature also attributes eyes and tears to Allah. InAl-Milal wa al-Nihal, it is reported:\"At one time, the Eyes of Allah ached, and the angels went to visit Him. Allah shed tears over the Flood of Prophet Nuh (Noah) until His Eyes became red.\" (Al-Milal wa al-Nihal, Volume 1, p. 141)Although some Muslims may dismiss this narration as weak (da’if) and not found within the Quran, it still represents a documented claim in classical Islamic theology.3. Allah’s Eyes and the 'Kafir' InscriptionAnas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said:\"There was no Prophet sent but that he warned his people about the one-eyed liar (Dajjal). Behold! He is one-eyed, and your Lord is not one-eyed. And between his eyes is written 'Kafir' (disbeliever).\" (Sahih al-Bukhari, Hadith No. 245, Volume 9)Here, Muhammad distinguishes between the Dajjal, who has one eye, and Allah, who does not have one eye, implying Allah has two.4. Allah Hears and SeesThe Quran attributes hearing and sight to Allah:\"Indeed, Allah commands you to render trusts to whom they are due and when you judge between people to judge with justice. Excellent is that which Allah instructs you. Indeed, Allah is Ever-Hearing and Ever-Seeing.\" (Surah An-Nisa 4:58)Having faculties such as hearing and sight are attributes of sentient beings, further indicating anthropomorphic qualities ascribed to Allah.ConclusionIt is evident from the foregoing scriptural and classical citations that Allah is consistently described with anthropomorphic features — a face, eyes, the capacity to weep, and sensory faculties such as hearing and sight. This presentation poses a serious theological issue for those who deny any resemblance or likeness between Allah and His creation.May the Lord bless you all abundantly.In His Service,Dr. Maxwell ShimbaMax Shimba Ministries Org ©2015References:Quran 2:115 (Surah Al-Baqarah)Quran 28:88 (Surah Al-Qasas)Al-Milal wa al-Nihal, Volume 1, p. 141Sahih al-Bukhari, Hadith No. 245, Volume 9Quran 4:58 (Surah An-Nisa)Bibliography:Al-Shahrastani, Muhammad ibn Abd al-Karim.Al-Milal wa al-Nihal.

However, an examination of Islamic and Biblical scriptures reveals a distinct difference between the city chosen by Allah in the Qur'an and the city chosen by Jehovah in the Bible. This paper investigates the cities designated as sacred by these two faiths and provides scriptural evidence for each, concluding with a theological analysis of the implications of these differences.The City Chosen by AllahAccording to the Qur'an, Allah chose the city ofMecca (Makkah)as his sacred city. Several verses explicitly affirm this:Surah An-Naml (The Ants) 27:91states:“For me, I have been commanded to serve the Lord of this city (Makkah), Him Who has sanctified it and to Whom belongs all things…”(Qur'an 27:91, Yusuf Ali Translation)Surah Aal-Imran (The Family of Imran) 3:96reads:“The first House (of worship) appointed for men was that at Bakka (another name for Mecca), full of blessing and of guidance for all kinds of beings.”(Qur'an 3:96, Yusuf Ali Translation)Surah Quraysh 106:3-4affirms:“So let them worship the Lord of this House, Who provides them with food against hunger, and with security against fear.”(Qur'an 106:3-4, Yusuf Ali Translation)From these passages, it is evident that Allah, the deity worshipped by Muslims, choseMeccaas his holy city and the site of his sacred house, the Ka’ba. The Prophet Muhammad was also commanded to worship the Lord of this city (Qur'an 27:91). This forms a central pillar of Islamic belief and practice.The City Chosen by JehovahIn contrast, the Bible clearly identifiesJerusalemas the city chosen by Jehovah (YHWH), the God of Israel. This is confirmed in multiple passages:2 Chronicles 6:4-6:“And he said: Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, who with his hands has fulfilled what he promised with his mouth to my father David, saying: Since the day that I brought my people out of the land of Egypt, I have chosen no city in all the tribes of Israel to build a house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any man to be a ruler over my people Israel; but I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there, and have chosen David to be over my people Israel.”(2 Chronicles 6:4-6, KJV)Other Biblical references affirm this divine choice:2 Chronicles 12:13Ezra 6:12Ezra 7:15, 27Psalm 26:8Zechariah 2:12The Hebrew nameYerushalayim(Jerusalem) means “foundation of peace.” Even during their exile, the Israelites would kneel and pray facing Jerusalem, as recorded inDaniel 6:10:“Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.”(Daniel 6:10, KJV)Theological ImplicationThrough these texts, it is evident that the city chosen by Jehovah isJerusalem, while the city chosen by Allah isMecca. This is a significant distinction between the two faiths. While both religions recognize sacred spaces, their choice of cities reflects divergent theological narratives and historical identities. In the Biblical tradition, Jerusalem stands as the eternal city of God (Psalm 132:13-14), whereas in Islam, Mecca holds this esteemed position.This distinction also serves as an indicator that the deity of the Qur'an is not the same as the God of the Bible. The different sacred cities and theological frameworks suggest thatAllah is not Jehovahbut represents a distinct religious construct introduced through Islamic revelation.ConclusionIn summary:The Qur'an designates Meccaas the holy city of Allah, the location of the Ka'ba, and the birthplace of Islam's central religious rites.The Bible identifies Jerusalemas the city of Jehovah, where His name dwells and where the Temple was established for His worship.Therefore, from a scriptural and theological standpoint, it is clear thatAllah of the Qur'an is not the God of the Bible.ReferencesHoly Bible, King James Version.The Qur'an, translated by Abdullah Yusuf Ali.2 Chronicles 6:4-6; 12:13Ezra 6:12; 7:15, 27Psalm 26:8; 132:13-14Daniel 6:10Zechariah 2:12Qur'an 27:91 (Surah An-Naml)Qur'an 3:96 (Surah Aal-Imran)Qur'an 106:3-4 (Surah Quraysh)BibliographyAli, Abdullah Yusuf.The Holy Qur'an: Text, Translation, and Commentary.

    "full_content": "Did Prophet Muhammad Celebrate Christmas? A Structured Apologetic EssayIntroductionWithin interfaith dialogues between Christianity and Islam, one of the most compelling areas of discussion is the historical and theological relationship between Prophet Muhammad and Jesus Christ. While Islam reveres Jesus (ʿĪsā ibn Maryam) as a mighty prophet and Messiah, it officially rejects the doctrines of His divinity and crucifixion. Yet, there exist lesser-known narratives within Islamic literature that suggest Prophet Muhammad might have acknowledged Jesus in ways not commonly recognized today. One such narration claims that Prophet Muhammad celebrated the birthday of Jesus every year on December 25th by inviting Abyssinians (Habesha) to perform in the mosque. This essay seeks to present this claim, analyze its authenticity, and discuss its implications for apologetics and interfaith understanding.Historical Claim: The Celebration of Jesus’ Birth in Early IslamA narration attributed to ʿĀʾisha, the wife of Prophet Muhammad, records:“The Prophet of Allah used to celebrate the birthday of the Prophet Jesus, son of Mary, every year on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month by inviting the Abyssinians who would sing and perform in the mosque.”Source:ʿUmdat al-Akhwān, Volume 4, Page 299.This account describes an annual event that appears strikingly similar to what Christians commemorate as Christmas. The participation of Abyssinians, known historically as one of the first Christian nations, adds weight to the possibility of cultural exchanges between early Muslims and neighboring Christian communities.Textual and Historical AnalysisAuthenticity of the SourceWhile this narration provides a fascinating glimpse into early Islamic social life, its authenticity remains questionable.ʿUmdat al-Akhwānis not among the six canonical Sunni Hadith collections (Sahih al-Bukhari,Sahih Muslim,Sunan Abu Dawood,Sunan al-Tirmidhi,Sunan al-Nasa’i, andSunan Ibn Majah), nor is it recognized in the major Shiite Hadith compilations. Its chains of transmission (isnad) are not documented in prominent biographical dictionaries of Hadith narrators (rijāl literature), raising legitimate concerns about its reliability.However, the context of Abyssinian performances in the mosque is corroborated inSahih al-BukhariandSahih Muslim, where ʿĀʾisha recounts witnessing Abyssinians playing with spears in the mosque during Eid celebrations. This cultural openness suggests that early Islamic society did accommodate artistic and cultural expressions within religious settings, especially among minorities.Possible Cultural InfluenceGiven Islam's emergence in a region surrounded by Christian and Jewish communities, and the Prophet's early interactions with Abyssinian Christians (notably the King of Axum who protected early Muslim refugees), it is conceivable that shared commemorations occurred informally, though not as religiously mandated observances.Apologetic and Theological ImplicationsAffirming the Honor of Jesus in IslamThis narration, even if apocryphal, reinforces the significant position of Jesus in Islamic theology. The Qur’an refers to Jesus asal-Masīḥ(the Messiah) and speaks of His miraculous birth, signs, and ascension (Qur’an 3:45–55; 4:157–158; 5:110). Celebrating His birth within the early Islamic community would reflect continuity with the prophetic tradition and acknowledgment of Jesus' importance in salvation history.Interfaith Harmony and Historical OpennessFor Christian apologists, such a narration is a valuable resource in demonstrating points of convergence between Christianity and Islam. It presents a historical moment where religious boundaries were more fluid and cultural exchange was encouraged within religious spaces. This opens a constructive avenue for promoting modern interfaith understanding, anchored in shared reverence for prophetic figures.Revisiting Contemporary Islamic ProhibitionsToday, many Islamic scholars condemn the celebration of birthdays, including the Prophet Muhammad’s (Mawlid an-Nabi) and other religious commemorations, labeling them as innovations (bidʿah). If such a practice as celebrating Jesus' birth under Muhammad's leadership were ever historically validated, it would challenge rigid contemporary positions and encourage a reevaluation of early Islamic cultural plurality.ConclusionThough the narration fromʿUmdat al-Akhwānlacks robust authentication by canonical Islamic standards, its content offers a fascinating lens through which to consider early Islamic attitudes toward Christianity and its prophetic figures. It suggests a society where interfaith coexistence and cultural exchange were possible and even encouraged under the Prophet’s leadership. For Christian and Muslim scholars alike, this narrative, whether historical or legendary, can serve as a meaningful touchpoint for dialogue about the shared legacies of Jesus Christ and Prophet Muhammad. It also invites deeper reflection on the evolution of religious practices and prohibitions within Islam, compared to its earliest expressions.ReferencesʿUmdat al-Akhwān, Volume 4, Page 299.Sahih al-Bukhari, Hadith No. 949.Sahih Muslim, Book of the Two Eid Festivals.The Qur'an: 3:45–55; 4:157–158; 5:110.",

The reported date—the 25th of the 12th month—coincides withDecember 25th, which is recognized in much of the Christian world asChristmas Day, the celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ.Critical Analysis of the SourceWhile this text is attributed toʿUmdat al-Akhwān, a reference not widely recognized or authenticated within mainstream Sunni or Shia canonical Hadith literature (likeSahih al-Bukhari,Sahih Muslim,Sunan Abu Dawood, etc.), its mention raises questions about early Muslim-Christian relations and mutual recognition of significant prophetic figures.If this tradition holds any historical value, it may reflect a tolerant and inclusive practice in Medina's early Islamic community, where cultural expressions by minorities like the Abyssinians were incorporated into religious gatherings.However, it should be noted:Classical Muslim scholars do not generally record any sanctioned Islamic celebration of Jesus' birthday.The mainstream Islamic position today does not recognize Christmas or Mawlid (Prophet's birthday celebrations) as religiously mandated practices.The concept of celebrating birthdays, including those of prophets, has historically been a point of contention in Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh).Possible Origins and Cultural InfluenceIt is possible that early Muslims, many of whom had close cultural and religious interactions with Christian communities—especially those from Abyssinia, which embraced Christianity long before Islam—might have informally acknowledged Christian feasts within a broader spirit of coexistence.Modern RelevanceIn contemporary interfaith dialogues, references like this can be valuable for promoting mutual respect and historical acknowledgment of shared figures like Jesus, who is honored in Islam as a mighty prophet and the Messiah (al-Masīḥ). It also invites reflection on how religious practices evolve and how early Islamic history was more culturally diverse than often portrayed.ConclusionWhile this narration remains outside the authenticated corpus of Hadith literature, it offers a fascinating lens into early Islamic communal life and possible interactions with Christian customs. It highlights the Prophet Muhammad’s reputed openness to cultural expressions within religious contexts and the potential for harmony between Abrahamic faiths.",

    "full_content": "WHY IS THERE NO HEALING POWER IN ISLAM? YET IN CHRISTIANITY, PEOPLE ARE HEALED IN THE NAME OF JESUS?By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteMax Shimba Ministries, 2015Introduction: What Is Healing?Healing is an act of faith that brings restoration to the soul or the body through prayer, the laying on of hands, or by hearing the true word of Christ Jesus. This faith-based act restores spiritual life and physical health where it has diminished. Notably, in many instances where individuals were physically healed, their souls were also restored.Therefore, we must ask: why was it that when Allah sent Jibril (Gabriel) to pray for the healing of his prophet Muhammad — when he fell ill after consuming poisoned food — their prayer did not succeed?This raises a significant theological inquiry: healing is not performed by any person independently but by God Himself. Even the most highly trained doctors do not heal; they administer treatment, but it is God who heals. God’s servants serve only as a bridge or vessel through which divine healing is delivered to those in need.The Futile Attempt of Allah and Jibril to Heal MuhammadReference:Ibn Sa’d, p. 265Aisha, the wife of the Prophet Muhammad, stated:\"When the Prophet of Allah was ill, Jibril would pray for him to Allah saying: 'In the name of Allah, He will heal you from every disease, from every evil that afflicts you, and from every one who intends harm against you. You will be healed.'\"But was Muhammad truly healed by the name of Allah?Let us examine a reliable hadith as recorded by Al-Bukhari:Bukhari’s Hadith 5.713Narrated by Aisha:\"The Prophet in his final illness would say: ‘O Aisha, I still feel the pain caused by the food I ate at Khaibar, and at this very moment, I feel as though my aorta is being severed from that poison.’”This leads to a crucial theological question:Can God pray and fail? Why did the prayers of Allah and Jibril for Muhammad’s healing prove ineffective?Now, Let Us Examine Jesus in the Bible: Did He Heal the Sick?Matthew 8:14-15“When Jesus came into Peter’s house, He saw Peter’s mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever. He touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she got up and began to serve Him.”The Bible does not record Jesus praying for this woman. What we observe is that Jesus touched her, and the fever immediately left. Merely the touch of a man of God carries healing power, even without uttered prayer, because the anointing resides within him.Even Peter healed the sick by his shadow alone because of the anointing upon him (Acts 5:15).The Importance of Placing Your Faith in the Name of Jesus ChristActs 3:1-8“One day Peter and John were going up to the temple at the time of prayer — at three in the afternoon. Now a man who was lame from birth was being carried to the temple gate called Beautiful, where he was put every day to beg from those going into the temple courts.When he saw Peter and John about to enter, he asked them for money.Peter looked straight at him, as did John. Then Peter said, ‘Look at us!’So the man gave them his attention, expecting to get something from them.Then Peter said, ‘Silver or gold I do not have, but what I do have I give you.In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk.’Taking him by the right hand, he helped him up, and instantly the man’s feet and ankles became strong. He jumped to his feet and began to walk.”When tracing the history of this man’s condition, we find that he had been lame since birth and was over forty years old when healed (Acts 4:22).What was the secret behind this miracle?Did this man walk through the power of Peter and John? Or through the power of the name of Jesus Christ?Many people today place their faith in the minister rather than in the name of Jesus Christ when they see someone being used by God in healing.Peter’s Clarification on the Source of the MiracleWhen the crippled man was healed, the people who witnessed the event were astonished, assuming that Peter and John possessed inherent power. But Peter addressed the crowd:Acts 3:11-12“While the man held on to Peter and John, all the people were astonished and came running to them in the place called Solomon’s Colonnade.When Peter saw this, he said to them: ‘Fellow Israelites, why does this surprise you? Why do you stare at us as if by our own power or godliness we had made this man walk?’”Peter then revealed the true source of this miraculous healing:Acts 3:13-16“The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified His servant Jesus… **By faith in the name of Jesus, this man whom you see and know was made strong. It is Jesus’ name and the faith that comes through Him that has completely healed him, as you can all see.’”Reflect carefully on Peter’s words:“By faith in the name of Jesus, this man… was made strong.”Peter and John placed their faith not in their own strength, but in the name of Jesus Christ. They were certain that the secret to miracles lies in that name — and that is why, when they encountered the crippled man, they commanded him to walkin the name of Jesus.The Early Church’s Commitment to the Name of JesusBecause of this, the early disciples were forbidden to preach or teach in the name of Jesus by Anas, the high priest. Yet when they were threatened, they prayed:Acts 4:18, 29-31“Now, Lord, consider their threats and enable your servants to speak your word with great boldness. Stretch out your hand to heal and perform signs and wonders **through the name of your holy servant Jesus.’”After they prayed, the place where they were meeting was shaken. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God boldly.”Conclusion: The Power of the Name of JesusIt is essential to remind people of the importance of placing their faith in the name of Jesus Christ if they desire to see the hand of the Lord healing and performing miracles in their lives and in their ministries.Dear reader, why waste your time with witch doctors or occultists?Call upon the name of the living Jesus — for He desires to heal all your diseases.If you are suffering from any illness, please contact us throughmaxshimbaministries@gmail.comor call us at(347) 770-4886.No matter the disease, reach out to us — for the name of Jesus will heal you.By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteMax Shimba Ministries, 2015",

    "full_content": "The Confusion in the Qur’an Between Maryam, Sister of Aaron, and Mary, the Mother of JesusBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThe Qur'an, revered by Muslims as the final and perfect revelation, presents numerous narratives drawn from earlier Judeo-Christian traditions. However, a critical textual analysis reveals a historical and genealogical conflation in the identification of Mary, the mother of Jesus, with Maryam, the sister of Aaron and Moses. This scholarly article examines the textual and chronological inconsistencies within the Qur’anic narrative regarding Mary, investigates the implications for Islamic theology, and juxtaposes the Qur’anic portrayal with biblical and historical sources. The study highlights how this confusion raises significant questions about the historical reliability and internal consistency of the Qur’anic text.1. IntroductionIslamic theology affirms the virgin birth of Jesus (Isa) through Mary (Maryam), who is highly revered in the Qur’an. However, the Qur’anic narrative appears to mistakenly conflate two distinct historical figures separated by approximately 1,500 years: Maryam, the sister of Moses and Aaron from the Old Testament, and Mary, the mother of Jesus from the New Testament. This article critically explores this conflation, analyzing its origins, textual evidence, and implications for Islamic theology and comparative scriptural studies.2. The Biblical Maryam and Mary: Historical ContextIn the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh),Miriam (Maryam)is introduced as the sister ofMoses (Moshe)andAaron (Aharon)(Exodus 15:20; Numbers 26:59). She was a prophetess and a significant figure during the Israelites’ exodus from Egypt, living approximately1500 years before the birth of Jesus Christ.Conversely,Mary (Greek: Μαρία, Hebrew: מִרְיָם), the mother of Jesus, appears in the New Testament as a young Jewish woman of Nazareth, espoused to Joseph, and chosen by God to bear the Messiah (Luke 1:26–38). The genealogies in Matthew 1 and Luke 3 situate Mary in the lineage of David, centuries after the era of Moses and Aaron.Thus, from a historical and genealogical perspective, these two women belong to vastly different eras and family lineages.3. The Qur’anic Narrative and the Genealogical ConfusionInSurah Maryam (Chapter 19), the Qur'an narrates the annunciation and virgin birth of Jesus, presenting Maryam as the daughter of Imran (Amram) and the sister of Aaron:“O sister of Aaron! Your father was not a man of evil, nor was your mother unchaste.”(Qur'an 19:28)Additionally, inSurah Al-Imran (Chapter 3), the Qur'an names Maryam’s father asImran:“[And mention] when the wife of Imran said, ‘My Lord, indeed I have pledged to You what is in my womb, consecrated [for Your service], so accept this from me.’”(Qur'an 3:35)In the Hebrew Bible,Amram (Arabic: Imran)is explicitly identified as the father ofMoses, Aaron, and Miriam(Numbers 26:59). The Qur'anic Mary, mother of Jesus, is thus genealogically identified as their sister, a chronological impossibility given the historical gap of over a millennium.4. Classical Muslim Exegesis and Apologetic ResponsesEarly Muslim commentators, such asIbn KathirandAl-Tabari, recognized this apparent anachronism. Several apologetic interpretations attempted to resolve the issue:Some argued that“sister of Aaron”was anhonorific title, reflecting piety rather than literal kinship.Others claimed thatMary’s brother was coincidentally named Aaron, a figure otherwise absent from credible historical records.Another explanation suggested that the family of Mary bore the ancestral title“House of Imran”as a symbol of spiritual heritage.However, these interpretations lack textual and historical corroboration in either Jewish or Christian traditions and appear as retrospective justifications rather than evidence-based clarifications.5. The Theological and Historical ImplicationsThis conflation is significant because it directly challenges thehistorical reliability of the Qur'anic textand its claimed divine inerrancy. Thegenealogical misplacementnot only distorts biblical history but also introduces inconsistencies in the Qur’anic narrative structure:It undermines the Qur'an’s assertion of confirming previous scriptures (Qur'an 5:48).It reveals a reliance onapocryphal Christian sourcesand oral traditions that were circulating in Arabia during Muhammad’s time, which may have contained confused or legendary material.It calls into question the claim of the Qur’an being aclear, preserved, and perfect revelationfree from error.This discrepancy provides critical grounds for comparative theological discussions onthe integrity of religious textsand the processes ofscriptural transmission.6. Comparative Scriptural Integrity: Bible vs. Qur’anTheBible, despite undergoing extensive textual criticism, maintains clear historical distinctions between its characters. Miriam, the sister of Moses and Aaron, is consistently situated in the Exodus narrative, while Mary, mother of Jesus, belongs to the first-century Roman Judea context. The genealogies in Matthew 1 and Luke 3 affirm this chronological separation.By contrast, the Qur'anic confusion points to thelimitations of oral transmissionand reliance onsecondary sourcesin early Islamic tradition, contrary to its claims of divine preservation and textual perfection (Qur'an 15:9).7. ConclusionThe Qur'anic conflation ofMaryam, sister of Aaron, andMary, the mother of Jesus, represents a critical historical and genealogical error with profound implications for thecredibility of the Qur'anic text. While Islamic apologetics has sought to explain away the inconsistency through honorific and symbolic interpretations, these remain unsubstantiated by historical evidence. This study underscores the necessity for rigorous historical-critical methodology in examining religious texts and encourages open interfaith dialogue on scriptural authenticity.ReferencesThe Holy Qur’an, trans.

    "full_content": "The Term “God” in Arabic isIlāh: A Scholarly Examination of the Shahada, Qur’anic Text, and Theological ImplicationsBy Max ShimbaAbstractThis article investigates the linguistic and theological distinctions between the Arabic termsilāh(god) andAllāh(Allah) within the context of Islamic doctrine, particularly the Shahada (Islamic declaration of faith). Drawing from the Qur’an, authoritative hadith, and academic sources, it examines how these terms are used and their implications for interfaith discourse.1. IntroductionIn Islamic theology, theShahada—“Lā ilāha illā Allāh Muhammadur Rasūl Allāh”—is central, representing the cornerstone of Muslim belief. It can be found explicitly in the Qur’an (e.g., 3:18), as well as in canonical hadith collections such asSahih al-Bukhari(Vol. 4, Book 56, No. 725). The meaning and translation of key terms within the Shahada are crucial to understanding Islamic monotheism and its distinction from other faiths.2. Linguistic Analysis of the ShahadaThe Arabic phraselā ilāha illā Allāhcan be broken down as follows:lā(لا): “There is no,” “not,” “none” (Wehr, 1976).ilāha(إِلَـٰهَ): “god,” “deity,” “object of worship.” This is a generic noun (Lane, 1863).illā(إِلَّا): “except,” “but.” A contraction ofin-lā(Wehr, 1976).Allāh(اللّٰه): Proper noun; the unique name for the one God in Islam. Not translated; considered linguistically and theologically unique (Peters, 2003).Thus, the phrase translates as:“There is no god except Allah.”3. Academic and Lexical Sources3.1. Lexicographical EvidenceHans Wehr, “A Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic” (1976):Definesilāhas “a god, deity, object of worship.”Edward William Lane, “An Arabic-English Lexicon” (1863):Notesilāhas a generic term, whileAllāhis used exclusively for the God of Islam.Al-Tafsir.com(Saudi Government’s Official Portal): Confirms thatilāhis generic, whileAllāhis not translated and has no equivalent in other languages.3.2. Theological and Qur’anic ContextThe Qur’an 3:18:“Allah bears witness that there is no deity except Him…” (Sahih International translation).Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 4, Book 56, Hadith 725:Records the Shahada and its significance in Islamic faith.Tafsir al-Jalalayn:Explains thatilāhdenotes any object of worship, butAllāhis unique and incomparable.4. Theological Implications4.1. The Uniqueness of AllahThe Qur’an states in Surah al-Ikhlas (112:4): “And there is none comparable to Him.” Islamic theology maintains thatAllāhis sui generis, without partner, equal, or likeness (Nasr, 2003). To equate Allah with deities of other religions—such as the Christian concept of God, Buddha, or traditional African gods—contradicts Islamic monotheism (tawhid).4.2. Polemics and Interfaith DiscourseThe issue of translatingAllāhas “God” in other languages is a subject of ongoing theological debate (see Reynolds, 2010; Peters, 2003). While Arabic-speaking Christians may use “Allah” for God, Islamic doctrine maintains a theological distinction:ilāhcan refer to any deity, whileAllāhrefers uniquely to the one God of Islam.5. ConclusionA careful analysis of the Shahada and relevant Arabic terms demonstrates a clear distinction:ilāh= a generic term for “god” or “deity”Allāh= the unique, untranslatable proper name for the God of IslamTherefore, the assertion that “Allah is not simply ‘God’” but is uniquely identified in Islamic theology is well-supported by both textual and academic evidence.6.

A true Christian does not return to religious debates with pagans, who are among the Antichrists known as Muslims. This is a scriptural investigation comparing the message of the Holy Qur’an and the Holy Bible, from someone who lived in a mosque and by God’s grace came to know the truth. Welcome, and we wish you fruitful reading.BEGINNINGWe greet you again in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Once more, our God, whose name is YEHOVAH, has granted us grace to share these words of life—the TRUTH OF THE WORD OF GOD, THE BIBLE.First, I wish to clarify that this platform is not for religious purposes, but to sound the trumpet so that the unique and true children of God can flee from worship contrary to God’s will.We do not care what religion, nation, or language you are from; our aim is to examine the Holy Scriptures and uncover their truth.May the Lord bless you as you seek the truth.DO CHRISTIANS AND MUSLIMS WALK THE SAME PATH?Amos 3:3Can two walk together, unless they are agreed?Even a five-year-old child could answer NO!Reason No.1: THEY ARE A RELIGION, WE ARE THE CHURCHIslamic Reference:Qur’an 5:2–3 (Surat al-Ma’ida):\"O you who have believed, do not violate the rites of Allah or the sacred month or the sacrificial animals or the garlands or those coming to the Sacred House seeking bounty from their Lord and [His] pleasure... This day I have perfected for you your religion and completed My favor upon you and have approved for you Islam as religion...\"Qur’an 4:171 (Surat An-Nisa):\"O People of the Scripture, do not commit excess in your religion or say about Allah except the truth...\"Biblical Reference:Matthew 16:16, 18:Simon Peter answered, 'You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.' Jesus replied... 'On this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it.'Acts 2:41, 47:Those who accepted his message were baptized, and about three thousand were added to their number that day... And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.1 Corinthians 3:23:And you are Christ’s, and Christ is God’s.Acts 11:26:...The disciples were called Christians first at Antioch.Reason No.2: THE ONE TRUE GODMuslim preachers often compare Qur’anic and Biblical verses to claim that Allah is the same as Jehovah. Let us examine both the Qur’an and the Bible to see if this claim holds.Exodus 20:1–3:And God spoke all these words, saying, “I am the LORD your God... You shall have no other gods before Me.”The warning means there are other “gods” worshipped by people. The Hebrew “Elohim” and Greek “Theos” appear thousands of times in the Bible, but there are also mentions of false gods:Dagon(Judges 16:23)Baal(1 Kings 18:21)Artemis(Acts 19:24–28)Similarly, the Qur’an refers to other gods worshipped in Mecca:Qur’an 53:19–23 (Surat An-Najm):Have you considered al-Lat and al-‘Uzza and Manat, the third, the other one? ...These are nothing but names you have named, you and your fathers...Thus, different gods are worshipped by different groups. The prophets served Jehovah, but Muhammad worshipped Allah. Is Allah the same as Jehovah?Deuteronomy 6:4:Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one.Isaiah 45:18, 21:...I am the LORD, and there is no other.Psalm 86:10:For you are great and do marvelous deeds; you alone are God.John 17:3:Now this is eternal life: that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.1 Corinthians 8:4:...There is no God but one.Reason No.3: ALLAH IS NOT JEHOVAH GODQur’an 15:30–39 (Surat al-Hijr):Describes the story of Iblis refusing to bow to Adam and Allah granting him respite until the Day of Resurrection.Qur’an 51:56 (Surat adh-Dhariyat):I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me.Reason No.4: ALLAH SWEARS BY HIS CREATION, JEHOVAH DOES NOTQur’an 92:1–3 (Surat Al-Layl):By the night as it envelops and by the day as it appears...Qur’an 91:1–7 (Surat Ash-Shams):By the sun and its brightness... By the soul and Him who proportioned it...Yet, Jehovah does not swear by creation:Isaiah 44:24:I am the LORD, who has made all things, who alone stretched out the heavens, who spread out the earth by myself.Isaiah 45:22–23:...For I am God, and there is no other. By myself I have sworn...Hebrews 6:13:For when God made a promise to Abraham, because He could swear by no one greater, He swore by Himself...Jehovah swears by Himself, never by creation.Reason No.5: THEIR GOD DENIES JESUS CHRISTQur’an 19:35 (Surat Maryam):It is not befitting for Allah to take a son; exalted is He!Qur’an 112:1–4 (Surat Al-Ikhlas):He begets not, nor is He begotten...The Bible teaches:1 John 2:22–26:Who is the liar? It is whoever denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a person is the antichrist—denying the Father and the Son...Colossians 1:13–15:He has rescued us from the dominion of darkness... The Son is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation.John 3:16–17:For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son...Reason No.6: GOD’S NAMEQur’an 17:110 (Surat Al-Isra):Say, “Call upon Allah or call upon the Most Merciful. Whichever [name] you call—to Him belong the best names...”The name Allah appears 2,866 times in the Qur’an, but the Bible reveals God’s name as Jehovah:Exodus 6:2–3:God spoke to Moses and said, “I am the LORD [YHWH]... I appeared to Abraham... as God Almighty, but by my name Jehovah I was not known to them.”Psalm 83:18:That men may know that You, whose name alone is the LORD [YHWH], are the Most High over all the earth.NB: “God” is a title, not a personal name.Reason No.7: THE MESSAGE IS DIFFERENTWhile Islamic apologists claim the prophets taught the same message as Muhammad, the evidence is otherwise:Qur’an 41:6 (Surat Fussilat):Say, “I am only a man like you, to whom it has been revealed that your god is one God...”Qur’an 29:46–47 (Surat Al-Ankabut):...Our God and your God is one; and to Him we submit.However, the Bible teaches distinct revelation through Jesus Christ and the apostolic church.Reason No.8: ANGELS—GABRIEL OR MICHAEL?Islam claims Gabriel (Jibril) is the chief angel:Qur’an 81:19–21 (Surat At-Takwir):Indeed, the Qur’an is the word of a noble messenger [Jibril], having power and with the Owner of the Throne, secure [in position]...The Bible presents Michael as the chief angel:Jude 1:9:But even the archangel Michael... said, “The Lord rebuke you!”Therefore, the chief angels differ.Reason No.9: THE CHOSEN CITY—MECCA OR JERUSALEM?Qur’an 27:91 (Surat An-Naml):I am commanded only to worship the Lord of this city [Mecca]...Qur’an 3:96 (Surat Al-Imran):Indeed, the first House [of worship] established for mankind was that at Mecca...Jehovah chose Jerusalem:2 Chronicles 6:4–6:...But I have chosen Jerusalem for my Name to be there...Reason No.10: PURITY AND HOLINESSQur’an 53:32 (Surat An-Najm):...So do not claim yourselves to be pure. He is most knowing of who fears Him.Qur’an 12:53 (Surat Yusuf):And I do not acquit myself. Indeed, the soul is a persistent enjoiner of evil...Jehovah commands His people to be holy:Isaiah 43:3:For I am the LORD your God, the Holy One of Israel...Leviticus 11:44:Consecrate yourselves therefore, and be holy, for I am holy...1 Peter 1:15–16:Be holy, because I am holy.Reason No.11: PARADISE—ISLAMIC OR CHRISTIAN?Luke 20:34–36:The people of this age marry and are given in marriage. But those who are considered worthy... will neither marry nor be given in marriage...Islamic Paradise (Jannah) is described as a place of physical pleasures:Qur’an 39:20:But those who fear their Lord will have chambers, above them chambers built high...Qur’an 47:15:The description of Paradise... rivers of water... milk... wine... honey... and therein are for them purified spouses...Sunan Ibn Majah, vol. 5, p. 546, Hadith 4337:Each man will marry seventy-two wives in Paradise...Christian heaven, in contrast, is spiritual (Romans 14:17; Revelation 7:16–17).Reason No.12: THE FINAL DESTINY OF ALLAH AND HIS FOLLOWERSQur’an 51:56:And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me.Qur’an 6:128:The Fire is your residence, wherein you will abide eternally...Sahih al-Bukhari, vol. 6, hadith 371, p. 353:Allah will place His foot in Hell and it will say “Enough! Enough!”Biblical teaching is different:Matthew 25:41, 46; Revelation 20:10, 21:8:The lake of fire is prepared for the devil and his angels, and the wicked will be eternally separated from God.ConclusionIt is evident from the Qur’an, Bible, and Islamic Hadith that Allah, worshipped by Muslims, isnotthe same as Jehovah, the God worshipped by Christians. If you, as a Muslim, realize this truth, I urge you by the grace of Christ to receive Jesus into your life and escape the worship of Satan, saving your soul from eternal death.Welcome to Jesus Christ our Lord.Revelation 3:20:Here I am!

    "full_content": "Islam and the Gospel: An Academic Exposé of Theological ContradictionBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThe relationship between Islam and Christianity, especially in their foundational texts, is marked by profound doctrinal divergence. While both faiths invoke Abrahamic heritage and affirm certain shared figures, the Quran's portrayal of Jesus Christ, Christian doctrine, and Christian believers is not merely different—it is fundamentally antagonistic to the heart of the Gospel. This article systematically examines Quranic statements about Jesus and Christians, demonstrates their incompatibility with Christian revelation, and exposes the Quran’s polemical agenda as irreconcilable with the New Testament message of redemption.IntroductionSince the advent of Islam in the 7th century, Muslims have asserted continuity with the Biblical tradition. However, the Quran repeatedly contradicts the central claims of Christianity. This article examines the most significant of these contradictions, analyzes their theological import, and shows that, contrary to the claims of Islamic apologetics, the Quran does not affirm the Gospel but rather sets itself in opposition to its most foundational truths.1. The Crucifixion of Jesus: History and Revelation DeniedQuranic Claim\"And [for] their saying, 'Indeed, we have killed the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, the messenger of Allah.' And they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him; but [another] was made to resemble him to them.\"Quran 4:157Christian TeachingThe crucifixion of Jesus Christ is the historical and theological core of the Gospel:“For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures.”(1 Corinthians 15:3)All four Gospels (Matthew 27, Mark 15, Luke 23, John 19) attest to the crucifixion, as does the testimony of secular historians such as Tacitus and Josephus.AnalysisThe Quranic denial of the crucifixion constitutes a repudiation of the Gospel itself. The Christian doctrine of atonement—Jesus' sacrificial death for sin—is not an optional belief, but “of first importance.”If Christ was not crucified, there is no salvation, no resurrection, and no Christianity (see 1 Corinthians 15:17).Scholarly ConsensusHistorians, both secular and religious, agree on the historical certainty of Jesus’ crucifixion. Noted historian Bart Ehrman writes:“One of the most certain facts of history is that Jesus was crucified on orders of the Roman prefect Pontius Pilate.”The Quran’s denial is a unique and much later claim, unsupported by historical evidence.2. The Identity of Jesus: Muslim Prophet or Divine Savior?Quranic Claim“But when Jesus felt [persistence in] disbelief from them, he said, 'Who are my supporters for [the cause of] Allah?' The disciples said, 'We are supporters for Allah. We have believed in Allah and testify that we are Muslims [submitting to Him].’”Quran 3:52Christian TeachingJesus never called himself a Muslim. The Gospel records Jesus as the unique Son of God (John 3:16), the Word made flesh (John 1:14), and the only Savior of mankind (Acts 4:12).AnalysisTo retroactively call Jesus and his disciples “Muslims” is anachronistic and historically untenable. It is an attempt by the Quran to subsume Christian revelation into a new, incompatible framework.3. The Quran’s View of Christians: Condemnation and HostilityChristians Are DeludedQuran 9:30: \"The Christians say, 'The Messiah is the son of Allah.' That is their statement from their mouths; they imitate the saying of those who disbelieved [before them]. May Allah destroy them; how are they deluded?\"Christians Lie About GodQuran 10:68: \"They have said, 'Allah has taken a son.' Exalted is He; He is the [one] Free of need. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. You have no authority for this [claim]. Do you say about Allah that which you do not know?\"Christians Are Disbelievers, Destined for HellQuran 5:72: \"They have certainly disbelieved who say, 'Allah is the Messiah, the son of Mary'... the Fire will be his refuge.\"Christians Should Be Fought and SubjugatedQuran 9:29: \"Fight those who do not believe in Allah...among the People of the Book...until they give the jizya [tax] willingly while they are humbled.\"Christians Are EnemiesQuran 5:51: \"O you who have believed, do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies...they are [in fact] allies of one another. And whoever is an ally to them among you—then indeed, he is [one] of them.\"Christians Worship Mary and JesusQuran 5:116: \"[And beware the Day] when Allah will say, 'O Jesus, Son of Mary, did you say to the people, \"Take me and my mother as deities besides Allah?\"'\"4. Contradiction with the Gospel of Jesus ChristThe Gospel’s TeachingThe New Testament presents a radically different message:Salvation is through Christ alone(John 14:6; Acts 4:12).God is loveand desires all to be saved (1 Timothy 2:4; John 3:16).Christians are called to love, not to subjugate(Matthew 5:44).Jesus is the Son of God(Matthew 16:16–17; John 20:31).On the Deity of ChristThe Quran’s repeated denials of Christ’s Sonship and deity (e.g., 5:72; 9:30; 10:68) are not mere misunderstandings; they are explicit rejections of the apostolic proclamation (see 1 John 2:22–23).On Christian WorshipThe charge that Christians worship Mary is a straw man. Nowhere in the canonical Gospels or apostolic writings is Mary worshiped or elevated to divine status.Christian Trinitarian doctrine is monotheistic, affirming one God in three Persons—not the polytheism alleged by the Quran.5. Theological Consequences and Historical OutcomesThe Quran’s polemic against Christians results not only in theological separation but also in social and political animosity:The doctrine of fighting and subjugating Christians (Quran 9:29) became the basis for centuries of Islamic dhimmitude, whereby Christians in Muslim lands were made second-class citizens, subject to extra taxation and legal discrimination.The explicit injunction not to take Christians as friends or allies (Quran 5:51) institutionalizes hostility, contrary to the Gospel’s call for peace and reconciliation (Romans 12:18).6. Conclusion: The Incompatibility of Islam with the GospelIt is impossible, with academic and theological integrity, to affirm both the Quran and the Gospel.The Quran denies the crucifixion, the deity and Sonship of Jesus, and the very heart of the Christian message. It misrepresents Christian worship and openly declares Christians to be deluded, disbelievers, and enemies of God.Christians must recognize that Islam, as defined by its primary text, is not a friendly neighbor but a system of belief that stands in direct opposition to the saving truth of the Gospel.For the faithful follower of Jesus Christ, allegiance to the Gospel means exposing error and holding fast to the apostolic faith delivered once for all to the saints (Jude 3).ReferencesThe Holy Bible (ESV, NIV, KJV)The Quran (Sahih International Translation)Ehrman, Bart D.,Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New MillenniumCragg, Kenneth,The Call of the MinaretWood, David,The Quran vs. the Bible: A Critique of Islam’s Sacred TextsWhite, James R.,What Every Christian Needs to Know About the QuranMcDowell, Josh,The Resurrection FactorJosephus, Flavius,Antiquities of the JewsTacitus, Cornelius,AnnalsDr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

    "full_content": "Zul-Qarnain and the Setting of the Sun in Surah 18:85-86: An Academic AnalysisBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThe narrative of Zul-Qarnain and the setting of the sun as described in the Qur’an (Surah 18:85–86) has long been a subject of debate, especially regarding its compatibility with astronomical realities. This paper critically examines the literal meaning of the Qur’anic text, the historical context of its interpretation among early Muslims, and the responses by Muslim scholars to challenges raised by this passage.1. The Text of Surah 18:85-86Surah Al-Kahf (18:85-86) states (various translations):“So he followed a way. Until, when he reached the setting of the sun, he found it set in a spring of dark mud, and he found near it a people...”(Sahih International, 18:85-86)A straightforward reading seems to suggest that Zul-Qarnain witnessed the sun setting in a muddy or dark spring. This passage has been the subject of much theological, philosophical, and scientific scrutiny.2. Astronomy and the Early Islamic WorldIt is often overlooked that Abbasid-era Islamic rulers and scholars, both Arabs and Persians, made significant advancements in astronomy. They named many stars and corrected astronomical tables inherited from ancient Egyptians (such as Ptolemy’s tables). Nevertheless, modern astronomy is unequivocal: the sun is vastly larger than Earth, and Earth orbits the sun, not the other way around. The sun never physically “sets” in a spring of muddy water.3. Who Was Zul-Qarnain?The identity of Zul-Qarnain remains debated. Islamic sources offer four main theories:Alexander the Great: The majority opinion identifies Zul-Qarnain (“the one with two horns”) as Alexander the Great. There is an apocryphal legend that Alexander was a god who possessed two ram’s horns. This idea is not supported by historical facts, and the practical challenges (such as wearing a helmet with two horns) make this legend dubious. Nonetheless, many Muslims historically have believed that Surah 18 refers to Alexander.Cyrus I of Persia: Another theory suggests that Zul-Qarnain was Cyrus I, whose kingdom comprised two principal peoples, the Medes and the Persians. There is, however, little evidence connecting the “two horns” to him.A King of Yemen: Some traditions associate Zul-Qarnain with a Yemeni king who wore a helmet adorned with two ram’s horns.An Unknown Figure: Some scholars suggest Zul-Qarnain was simply an unknown person, but explanations involving unnamed historical figures risk incoherence.Conclusion:Ultimately, regardless of Zul-Qarnain’s identity, the narrative’s claim that the sun sets in a muddy spring contradicts established scientific knowledge.4. Interpretations and Muslim ResponsesView 1: Literal Interpretation – The Sun Sets in a Muddy SpringEarly Muslims, including the classical historian al-Tabari, understood the verse literally. Al-Tabari (d. 923 CE), for example, in hisHistory(Vol. 1, p. 234) states that Zul-Qarnain “witnessed the setting of the sun in its resting place, in a black, foul-smelling spring.” Similar interpretations appear throughout al-Tabari’s works (see also Vol. 5, pp. 173–174; Vol. 1, p. 371).Additionally, al-Tabari recounts that, according to ancient lore, the earth rests on a great fish (History, Vol. 1, p. 220), reflecting the mythological worldview that pervaded the ancient Near East.View 2: The Sun Seemed to Set in the Lake of Ithaca, MacedoniaSome have suggested that the verse refers to Alexander observing the sun setting over a lake in Macedonia (Ithaca). However, this is inconsistent with known Greek and Phoenician geography, since Greeks had colonies far west of Macedonia, including in Spain and Sicily, centuries before Alexander. Greek writers such as Aristotle mention explorers from Sardinia, which is much farther west. Thus, no educated Greek or Macedonian would have believed the sun literally set in Macedonia.View 3: “Spring of Muddy Water” Refers to the Atlantic OceanAnother interpretation is that the “spring” refers to the Atlantic Ocean. Yet the Atlantic is neither muddy nor black, but blue-green, and it is an ocean, not a spring. Alexander the Great, Cyrus I, and the Yemeni kings never reached the Atlantic’s edge, nor does the Qur’an mention such a journey.View 4: Refers to the Black SeaSome posit that the spring refers to the Black Sea. Yet, there is no evidence Cyrus I ever traveled to the regions east of the Black Sea. Additionally, the Black Sea is not a “spring,” and even ancient Egyptians and Greeks knew the sun did not set in the Black Sea.View 5: Refers to the Aegean SeaIf the reference were to the Aegean, Persians were well acquainted with Greeks across that sea, and would not have believed that the sun set there.View 6: Refers to the Red SeaIf the “spring” was the Red Sea, Yemenis (Sabaeans) were familiar with Abyssinians (Ethiopians) across the water, so the claim would again be implausible.View 7: Metaphorical InterpretationSome propose the description is metaphorical. However, the Qur’an does not indicate the story is allegorical or parabolic, and the earliest Muslim interpreters did not treat it as such. Therefore, if it was meant metaphorically, the Qur’an failed to clarify its figurative intent, misleading its audience.View 8: A Dream NarrativeOthers suggest Muhammad was narrating a dream or vision. However, neither the Qur’an nor early Islamic sources present the story as a vision or dream. If millions believe a passage is literal, but the author failed to clarify its true nature, this calls into question the reliability of the narrative.5. ConclusionRegardless of Zul-Qarnain’s identity—Alexander the Great, Cyrus I, or another—the Qur’an presents the sun as setting in a muddy spring as a literal occurrence. Even a millennium before Muhammad, educated people knew the sun does not set in Spain or any earthly body of water. Early Muslims, including the companions and successors of Muhammad, interpreted this passage literally.If Allah, the God of Islam, revealed this information, and it was factually incorrect, then this is a clear error. If, instead, the Qur’an was authored by Muhammad or his contemporaries, the mistake is explained by the worldview of the time. Alternatively, if the Qur’an’s God does not exist, then the question of error or deception is moot.References and BibliographyQur’an Translations and CommentariesArberry, Arthur J.The Koran Interpreted.

It interrogates the origin, lack of scriptural basis, and the critical stance of renowned Islamic scholars, arguing that the practice is an innovation (bid‘ah) rooted in pagan custom rather than Islamic revelation.1. The History of MawlidHistorical records indicate that neither the Prophet Muhammad nor his Companions celebrated the Mawlid. The earliest reports of the celebration emerge centuries after the Prophet's death, primarily among the Fatimid (Ismaili Shi‘a) dynasty in Egypt (Calvert, 2010; Schimmel, 1987).Al-Hafidh al-Sakhawi (d. 902 AH) records:“The celebration of the Mawlid was not practiced by the pious predecessors (Salaf al-Salih) of the first three generations. It was introduced after them.”(al-Sakhawi,Subul al-Huda wa al-Rashad, Vol. 1, p. 439)Al-Maqrizi (d. 845 AH) provides a historical account:“The Fatimid rulers inaugurated the Mawlid festival along with others, such as Mawlid of ‘Ali, Fatima, Hasan, Husayn, and their living Imam, as well as other seasonal festivals.”(al-Maqrizi,al-Khitat, Vol. 1, p. 490)Further, Shaykh ‘Ali Mahfudh notes:“The first to introduce Mawlid in Cairo were the Fatimid rulers in the 4th century AH. They created six Mawlids.”(Mahfudh,al-Ibda‘ fi Madhahir al-Ibtida‘, p. 251)Sunni AdoptionSheikh Abdulla Saleh Farsy states:“The first official Mawlid recited by Sunnis was organized by King Mudhaffar ad-Din in northern Iraq, a brother-in-law to Sultan Salahuddin al-Ayyubi. This event was unprecedented in size and splendor.”(Farsy,Tafsiri ya Mawlid Barzanji, p. iv)2. Absence of Scriptural EvidenceThere is no authentic evidence from the Quran or the sahih hadith specifying the exact date of the Prophet's birth or instructing Muslims to commemorate it.Safi-ur-Rahman Mubarakpuri writes:“Muhammad… was born on Monday, 9th Rabi‘ al-Awwal, in the Year of the Elephant… corresponding to April 20 or 22, 571 CE.”(Mubarakpuri,Ar-Raheeq al-Makhtum, p. 62)Sirajur Rahman adds:“The event of the Elephant occurred in Muharram, fifty-five days before the Prophet’s birth, suggesting the birth fell between 25th Safar and 25th Rabi‘ al-Awwal.”(Rahman,Al-Mustafa, p. 11)The Quran remains silent on the Prophet’s exact birth date and does not prescribe any celebration of his birth (Nasr, 2003).3. Scholarly Critique and the Question of Innovation (Bid‘ah)Notable classical and contemporary scholars have denounced the Mawlid as an innovation with pagan undertones:Imam al-Shatibi (d. 790 AH): Criticized the Mawlid as an innovation in his magnum opus.(al-Shatibi,al-I‘tisam, Vol. 1, p. 34)Imam al-Fakihani (d. 734 AH): Authored a treatise refuting the legitimacy of Mawlid.(al-Fakihani,Risalah fi Mawlid al-Nabi)Imam Ibn al-Hajj al-Maliki (d. 737 AH): Explicitly categorized Mawlid as bid‘ah.(Ibn al-Hajj,al-Madkhal, Vol. 2, pp. 11–12)Abu ‘Abdillah al-Haffar al-Maliki: Asserted the absence of Mawlid celebration among the Prophet’s Companions or their successors.(al-Haffar,al-Mi‘yar al-Mu‘rab, Vol. 7, p. 99)Abu At-Tayyib Shams al-Haq al-‘Aẓimabadiand his teacher Bashiruddin Qannuji authored a monograph refuting the practice.(Qannuji,Ghayat al-Kalam fi Ibtal Amal al-Mawlid wal-Qiyam)The Prophet himself is reported to have said:“Whoever introduces into our religion that which is not from it, it will be rejected.”(Sahih al-Bukhari, Hadith 2697; Sahih Muslim, Hadith 1718)Key Questions for ReflectionWhere in the Quran are Muslims instructed or permitted to celebrate the Mawlid?Where in the Quran is the birth or lifespan of Muhammad mentioned in detail?Why do Muslims celebrate the Mawlid when it is absent from the Quran and authentic hadith?Who is the ultimate authority for Muslims: Allah, Muhammad, the Quran, authentic hadith, or established schools of law?Referencesal-Fakihani, Abu’l-‘Abbas Ahmad.Risalah fi Mawlid al-Nabi(Treatise on the Prophet’s Birthday).al-Haffar, Abu ‘Abdillah.al-Mi‘yar al-Mu‘rab.al-Khatib al-Baghdadi, Abu Bakr Ahmad.Tariq Baghdad.al-Maqrizi, Taqi al-Din Ahmad.al-Khitat(The Plans), Vol. 1, Cairo, 1999.al-Mubarakpuri, Safi-ur-Rahman.Ar-Raheeq al-Makhtum(The Sealed Nectar), Darussalam, 2002.al-Sakhawi, Shams al-Din Muhammad.Subul al-Huda wa al-Rashad, Vol. 1.al-Shatibi, Abu Ishaq.al-I‘tisam, Vol. 1, Beirut: Dar Ibn ‘Affan, 1997.Farsy, Abdulla Saleh.Tafsiri ya Mawlid Barzanji, Zanzibar.Ibn al-Hajj al-Maliki, Muhammad.al-Madkhal, Vol. 2, Beirut: Dar al-Kutub al-‘Ilmiyyah, 1981.Mahfudh, ‘Ali.al-Ibda‘ fi Madhahir al-Ibtida‘, Cairo, 1970.Mubarakpuri, Safi-ur-Rahman.Ar-Raheeq al-Makhtum(The Sealed Nectar), Darussalam, 2002.Nasr, Seyyed Hossein, et al.The Study Quran, HarperOne, 2015.Qannuji, Bashiruddin.Ghayat al-Kalam fi Ibtal Amal al-Mawlid wal-Qiyam.Rahman, Sirajur.Al-Mustafa, Ansaar Muslim Youth Organisation, 1993.Schimmel, Annemarie.And Muhammad is His Messenger: The Veneration of the Prophet in Islamic Piety, University of North Carolina Press, 1987.Calvert, John.Sayyid Qutb and the Origins of Radical Islamism, Columbia University Press, 2010.Qur’an: Various translations, e.g., M.A.S.

    "full_content": "Muhammad’s Attitude Towards Children: A Critical Scholarly ExaminationBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Servant of Jesus Christwww.maxshimbaministries.orgIntroductionThe subject of religious leadership and moral conduct, particularly in relation to the treatment of children, remains central to interfaith dialogue and the comparative study of world religions. This paper critically examines the character and actions of the Prophet Muhammad, as depicted in Islamic primary sources, in relation to children. It juxtaposes these findings with the teachings and actions of Jesus Christ, as recorded in the New Testament. The analysis intends to offer a clear perspective for those seeking to understand the ethical frameworks within which these two prominent religious figures operated.1. Muhammad’s Stance on the Killing of Children: A Hadith AnalysisA significant moral and theological concern arises from narrations regarding the conduct of Muhammad in the context of warfare and the treatment of non-combatants, particularly women and children. InSahih Muslim, one of the most authoritative collections of Hadith, Sa'b b. Jaththama reports:\"The Prophet of Allah (peace be upon him) was asked about the women and children of polytheists being killed during the night raids. He said: 'They are from them (i.e., they are part of them).'\"(Sahih Muslim, Hadith 4322; see also Sahih Bukhari 52:256)This narration indicates a disturbing moral ambiguity regarding the permissibility of collateral damage involving children in armed conflict, a position seemingly at odds with modern concepts of human rights and the protection of innocents during war (see: Peters, R. (1996). Jihad in Classical and Modern Islam. Princeton: Markus Wiener Publishers).The Execution of Singing GirlsFollowing the conquest of Mecca, sources in early Islamic historiography report that Muhammad ordered the execution of two female singers, Fartana and her companion, for satirizing him in song:\"The two singing-girls, Fartana and her friend, used to sing satirical verses about the Messenger of Allah. The Prophet ordered that they be put to death, and they were executed.\"(Ibn Ishaq,Sirat Rasul Allah, ed. A. Guillaume, p. 819)This episode is recorded in the earliest and most respected biography of Muhammad, and it highlights the grave consequences faced by even young women and girls who fell afoul of the Prophet's authority (see: Ibn Ishaq/Hisham 819; also referenced in al-Tabari,The History of al-Tabari, Vol. 8).2. Muhammad’s Marriage to Aisha: Historical Context and Ethical ConsiderationsAmong the most contentious aspects of Muhammad’s biography is his marriage to Aisha, which, according to several Hadith sources, occurred when she was very young:\"Aisha reported: The Prophet married me when I was six years old, and consummated the marriage with me when I was nine years old.\"(Sahih Muslim 3310; Sahih al-Bukhari 5133, 5134, 5135, 5158; Sunan Abu Dawud 2116)Aisha herself is quoted as saying:\"The Prophet married me when I was six years old, and had sexual intercourse with me when I was nine years old.\"(Sunan Abu Dawud 2116)Scholarly debate continues regarding the historical and cultural context of this marriage. However, contemporary ethical standards, informed by modern understandings of child development and consent, regard such actions as morally indefensible and legally criminal (see: Spencer, R. (2006). The Truth About Muhammad. Regnery Publishing; Barlas, A. (2002). \"Believing Women\" in Islam: Unreading Patriarchal Interpretations of the Qur'an. University of Texas Press).3. The Teachings of Jesus Concerning ChildrenBy contrast, the Gospels portray Jesus Christ as embodying a profoundly compassionate attitude toward children, emphasizing their inherent dignity and spiritual significance:\"Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.\"(Matthew 19:14; cf. Matthew 18:1-4; Mark 9:33-37; Mark 10:13-16)Jesus not only welcomed children but also used their example to illustrate the humility and purity required to enter the Kingdom of God. He publicly blessed children and affirmed their place in the community of believers (see: France, R. T. (2007). The Gospel of Matthew. Eerdmans; Nolland, J. (2005). The Gospel of Matthew: A Commentary on the Greek Text. Eerdmans).4. Comparative Ethical ReflectionFrom an ethical and theological standpoint, the contrast is stark:Muhammadis depicted in Islamic tradition as permitting or at least not preventing the killing of children in war and entering into a marital relationship with a prepubescent girl.Jesus, in the Christian tradition, is portrayed as a protector and lover of children, elevating them as exemplars of the qualities needed for entry into God’s kingdom.Such divergent portraits compel the conscientious seeker to critically evaluate which model truly embodies the spirit of divine love and moral uprightness. The choice between following a figure who, according to some sources, permitted harm to children, or one who cherished and blessed them, is ultimately a personal and spiritual decision.Conclusion: A Call for Moral DiscernmentIn light of these historical and scriptural records, I urge readers to examine the evidence thoughtfully. Consider whether Muhammad’s actions align with the standards of prophetic conduct expected of a messenger of God, or whether the example of Jesus, who loved and blessed children, represents the higher ethical path.The choice is yours:To follow Muhammad, who, according to these sources, permitted the killing and sexual exploitation of children,orTo follow Jesus, who loved, blessed, and welcomed children into the Kingdom of Heaven.Yours sincerely,Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Servant of Jesus Christwww.maxshimbaministries.orgReferencesSahih Muslim, Book 19, Hadith 4322; also Sahih Bukhari 52:256.Ibn Ishaq,Sirat Rasul Allah, ed.

Rooted in the earliest Islamic sources, the narrative claims that the Prophet Muhammad, at one point, recited verses in honor of pre-Islamic deities, which were subsequently abrogated and denounced as satanic interference. This article critically examines the historical evidence for the event, the textual variations in the Qur’an, early Islamic responses, and theological implications for the doctrines of revelation and scriptural integrity. Through the analysis of primary Islamic sources—biographies, hadith collections, and exegetical literature—this study contributes to the ongoing discourse on the transmission and preservation of sacred texts in Abrahamic religions.KeywordsQur’an, Satanic Verses, Muhammad, textual criticism, Islamic tradition, abrogation, scriptural integrity, polemics, revelation, early Islam.1. IntroductionWithin Islamic polemics and apologetics, the question of the reliability and preservation of holy scriptures remains central. Muslims often assert the divine preservation of the Qur’an, contrasting it with alleged textual corruption in the Bible. Yet, a critical review of Islamic historiography reveals episodes—such as the so-called “Satanic Verses”—that challenge simplistic notions of textual purity. This article investigates the “Satanic Verses” narrative, its documentation in Islamic sources, and its wider doctrinal consequences.2. Background: The Satanic Verses NarrativeThe term “Satanic Verses” refers to an incident recounted by numerous early Muslim authorities, wherein Satan is said to have inspired the Prophet Muhammad to utter verses affirming the intercessory power of three pre-Islamic goddesses: al-Lat, al-Uzza, and Manat. These verses were later abrogated and replaced within the Qur’anic corpus. The narrative, while highly contentious in Islamic thought, remains extensively documented in Islamic historical literature.3. Primary Sources and Early Islamic Historiography3.1 Qur’anic ContextSurah An-Najm (53:19–20)states:“Have you considered al-Lat and al-‘Uzza, and another, the third [goddess], Manat?”1Historical biographers recount that this passage was originally followed by a now-excised verse:“These are the exalted cranes (gharāniq), whose intercession is to be hoped for.”2This interpolation was later condemned as a product of satanic interference and removed, replaced with the current verses (53:21–22):“Is the male for you and the female for Him? That, then, is an unjust division.”3.2 Early Islamic BiographersFour principal early Muslim biographers preserve the episode:al-Wahidi / al-Waqidi (d. 207/823 CE):InAsbab al-Nuzul, describes how Muhammad’s conciliatory recitation led to the Meccan leaders’ approval, until Gabriel later rebuked him for reciting words not divinely revealed.3Ibn Sa’d (d. 230/845 CE):InKitab al-Tabaqat al-Kabir, corroborates the occurrence and details communal reactions.4Ibn Ishaq (d. 145/767 CE):InSirat Rasul Allah, reports that both Muslims and polytheists were momentarily reconciled by the verses, only for Muhammad to later retract them as satanic suggestion.5al-Tabari (d. 923 CE):InTarikh al-Rusul wa al-Muluk, provides a detailed account of Muhammad’s inner conflict, Satan’s intervention, and Gabriel’s subsequent correction.63.3 Other AcknowledgementsSeveral other prominent scholars and exegetes—including Abu Ma’shar, Ibn Abi Hatim, Ibn al-Mundhir, Ibn Hajar, Ibn Mardawayh, Musa ibn ‘Uqba, and Zamakhshari—reference or discuss the incident, indicating its prevalence in the early Islamic tradition.74. Indirect Evidence: Qur’an and Hadith4.1. Canonical HadithSahih al-BukhariandAbu Dawuddocument that, after Muhammad’s recitation of Surah An-Najm, both Muslims and pagans prostrated—a unique occurrence, suggesting the inclusion of conciliatory content.84.2. The Qur’an on Satanic InterferenceTwo passages are cited as allusions to this episode:Surah 22:52: “We did not send before you any messenger or prophet except that, when he desired, Satan threw [some suggestion] into his desire; but Allah abolishes that which Satan throws in, then Allah makes precise His verses...”Surah 17:73–75: Addresses external attempts to sway Muhammad from divine revelation, with warnings of grave consequences.5. Muslim Responses and Scholarly Critique5.1. Common Muslim ObjectionsLack of unanimity in the isnad (transmission chain):Some hadith collectors omit the incident, or question its reliability.Contradiction with Qur’anic monotheism and Muhammad’s inerrancy:Verses such as 15:9 and 41:42 are cited as evidence for the Qur’an’s incorruptibility.Redaction in Islamic sources:Later redactors like Ibn Hisham are known to have removed the episode from earlier biographies out of theological discomfort.95.2. Academic ResponsesScholarly consensus recognizes the multiplicity of independent early attestations, the early dating of the reports (predating major Sunni hadith collections), and the narrative’s consistency across biographical and exegetical sources. The practice of abrogation (naskh) within the Qur’an further supports the possibility of excised revelations.106. Theological and Scriptural ImplicationsThe Satanic Verses episode, if accepted, raises questions regarding the doctrine of revelation, prophetic impeccability (isma), and the Qur’an’s textual preservation. If Muhammad could temporarily utter non-divine words as revelation, it suggests a more dynamic—and vulnerable—process of scriptural transmission than traditional Islamic dogma permits.Conversely, if the incident is rejected, one must explain the widespread early Muslim attestation and the textual traces in both Qur’anic and hadith literature.The episode further intersects with the broader polemic between Islam and Christianity regarding the reliability and corruption of sacred texts, highlighting both shared anxieties and divergent doctrines of scriptural integrity.7. ConclusionThe “Satanic Verses” incident, deeply embedded in early Islamic literature, presents a significant case study in the history of religions. It compels both Muslims and non-Muslims to reckon with the realities of textual transmission, historical memory, and the complex evolution of doctrinal orthodoxy. Ultimately, the episode invites renewed reflection on the nature of divine communication, the limits of human agency in revelation, and the enduring quest for religious certainty.ReferencesCorrespondence:[Author Name], [Affiliation], [Email]Acknowledgments:The author thanks the staff at Max Shimba Ministries and the editorial board of theJournal of Comparative Religious Studiesfor their input.For further reading:www.MuslimHope.comwww.maxshimbaministries.orgThis article is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.If you need further customization (citations, additional sections, author bio, journal formatting, etc.), let me know your academic/religious field and target journal style!FootnotesQur’an 53:19–20.↩Guillaume, A.

Patristic Commentary: The Early Church on Prophets, Law, and Novel Revelation8.1. Early Christian Attitudes Toward Prophetic Successiona) Irenaeus of Lyons (c. 130–202 CE)InAgainst Heresies(Book IV, ch. 33), Irenaeus emphasizes theunity and consistency of God’s revelation:“The law and the prophets and the evangelists and the apostles…proclaimed one and the same God, perfect, just, and good.”Irenaeus repeatedly asserts thattrue prophetsconfirm and do not contradict the Torah:“The coming of the Son of God was prepared by the Law and the Prophets.”b) Tertullian (c. 155–240 CE)InPrescription Against Heretics(ch. 6–7), Tertullian warned:“No man is wise, no man is holy, except the man who is a disciple of the Law and the Prophets.”Tertullian sees any later prophet or teacher who seeks to “introduce another rule of faith” as ahereticand a corrupter of God’s original message.c) Origen (c. 184–253 CE)In hisContra Celsum(Book V), Origen defends thecontinuity and completeness of Mosaic revelation, insisting that all new claims must be measured by the “pattern given in the Law and Prophets.”d) John of Damascus (c. 676–749 CE)InFount of Knowledge(Book II: Heresies), John of Damascus, who lived after the rise of Islam, directly addressed Muhammad, calling him “the false prophet” who “having no miracles to show for himself, says that God gave him this written book [the Qur’an].”John accuses Muhammad of introducing doctrines “in direct contradiction to the Law and the Prophets,” and saw Islam as a post-Christian heresy, judged by the standards of biblical revelation.8.2. Patristic SummaryTheChurch Fathers—unanimous in their respect for the Mosaic Law—set a hermeneutical rule:Any prophet or teacher whose doctrine contradicts, adds to, or subtracts from the Mosaic Law is to be rejected.For them, Jesus fulfilled rather than abrogated the Law (Matt. 5:17–18). All later claims of prophecy must align with the “faith once delivered to the saints” (Jude 1:3).9. Rabbinic Commentary: Talmud, Midrash, and Medieval Jewish Thought9.1. The Talmud: Testing Prophets and Prophecya) Babylonian Talmud, Sanhedrin 90a–99bThe Talmud is clear that theTorah is eternal and unchangeable(Sanhedrin 99a):“He who says, ‘The entire Torah is from Heaven except one verse…’—such a one has despised the word of the Lord.”Sanhedrin 90a–93b:If a prophet’s message contravenes the Torah, even if accompanied by miracles, he is a false prophet and liable to death.“If he seeks to uproot even a single commandment, he is a false prophet.”b) Maimonides (Rambam, 1135–1204)In hisMishneh Torah, Laws of Foundations of the Torah, ch. 9–10:“If a prophet arises and performs a sign or wonder and says that God sent him to add to or to detract from a commandment…he is a false prophet.”“Even if he performs a sign, listen not to him.”InEpistle to Yemen, Maimonides identifies Muhammad as a “madman” who “added to and took away from the Torah” and thus cannot be accepted by the people of Israel.c) Rashi (1040–1105)On Deut. 13:2: “Even if he gives you a sign or a wonder…you shall not listen… For the Lord your God is testing you.”Rashi affirms that the test of a prophet is absoluteloyalty to the Torah, regardless of signs or wonders.9.2. Midrashic and Later Rabbinic ThoughtMidrash Tanchuma, Re’eh 13:“There will arise prophets who will say, ‘Let us go after other gods.’ The sign is not a proof, for the Law is above signs.”Rabbi Saadia Gaon (882–942):InThe Book of Beliefs and Opinions, Gaon maintains that only Moses had direct, unmediated prophecy; all others are subordinate and must conform to his Law.9.3. Jewish Evaluation of Later ClaimantsGeneral rabbinic opinion(from Maimonides to modern times) is that any claimant to prophecy who advocates abrogation or alteration of the Torah is anavi sheker(false prophet).Notably, both Islam and Christianity are viewed as forms ofsheker(false doctrine) where they diverge from Mosaic law. (SeeLetter to Yemen, Maimonides;Kuzariby Judah Halevi.)9.4. Rabbinic SummaryJewish tradition is explicit:The Torah is perfect, eternal, and unchangeable.Any prophet, no matter what signs he claims or performs, who seeks to alter the Torah or its commandments is to be rejected and, under Mosaic jurisdiction, put to death.10. Synthesis: The Voice of Moses, the Fathers, and the SagesThe combined witness of theMosaic Law, thePatristic Fathers, and theRabbinic Sagesestablishes a consistent rule of judgment:The Law of Moses is the absolute standard by which all future claims of revelation are measured.Muhammad’s teachings—introducing new laws, rituals, and a different concept of God—would be judged by Moses, the Church Fathers, and the rabbis alike as a clear breach, meriting condemnation.The patristic and rabbinic consensus is unwavering:fidelity to Torah is the litmus test for prophetic authenticity.11. ConclusionThebiblical,patristic, andrabbinictraditions are united:The Torah is inviolable;Any prophet contradicting or abrogating it is a false prophet, regardless of signs or claims;Muhammad, by his teaching and example, would have been judged and condemned under Mosaic Law, and declared false by the spiritual heirs of Moses in both the Synagogue and the Church.Expanded BibliographyPatristic Sources:Irenaeus,Against HeresiesTertullian,Prescription Against HereticsOrigen,Contra CelsumJohn of Damascus,Fount of KnowledgeRabbinic and Medieval Jewish Sources:Babylonian Talmud,Sanhedrin90a–99bRashi, Commentary on the TorahMaimonides,Mishneh TorahandEpistle to YemenSaadia Gaon,The Book of Beliefs and OpinionsMidrash TanchumaJudah Halevi,KuzariIslamic Sources:The Qur’anIbn Ishaq,Sirat Rasul AllahSahih al-Bukhari, Sahih MuslimModern Scholarship:Mark Durie,Revelation?

    "full_content": "Debate:Presented by Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThis debate seeks to rigorously examine the controversial claim that the Qur’an and authentic Hadiths provide evidence for Muhammad being identified as a false prophet by Allah Himself. The discussion will present both sides of the argument, encouraging scholarly discourse and critical engagement with the primary Islamic sources.Proposition: The Qur’an and Hadith Indicate Muhammad Was a False ProphetA. Scriptural Evidence from the Qur’anThe Qur’an provides the following passage:“And if [the Messenger] had made up about Us some [false] sayings, We would have seized him by the right hand; then We would have cut from him the aorta.”(Qur’an 69:44–46, Sahih International Translation)Analysis:This text is unambiguous: If Muhammad, the Messenger, were to fabricate revelations, Allah would punish him by cutting his \"aorta,\" the main artery of the heart, a fatal blow. This establishes a divine litmus test for prophetic authenticity—should Muhammad die by such means, it could be perceived as evidence of divine judgment.B. Testimony from Hadith Literature1. Sahih Bukhari 5:59:713At the end of his life, Muhammad reportedly said:“I feel as if my aorta is being cut from this poison.”2. Abu Dawud 34:4498Another narration echoes this:“I feel as if my aorta is being severed.”Analysis:According to Islamic tradition, Muhammad died after suffering for some time from the effects of poisoning. His own words invoke the very sign outlined in the Qur’an—his aorta being cut—which could be interpreted as fulfillment of Allah’s stated method of dealing with a false prophet.C. The Logical QuestionIf the Qur’an states that a false prophet’s aorta will be cut, and Muhammad himself claimed such an experience as he died, does this not constitute evidence, by the Qur’an’s own standard, that he was a false prophet?Why then do Muslims continue to follow Muhammad if, by this standard, he fits the Qur’an’s definition of a false prophet?Counterargument: Orthodox Islamic ResponseA balanced debate must present counterpoints as articulated by Muslim scholars and apologists.A. Context and InterpretationMuslim scholars argue that Qur’an 69:44–46 is a hypothetical warning, not a prophecy or historical prediction. The purpose of the passage is to underscore the severity of fabricating revelation, not to assert that Muhammad would actually do so. There is no evidence, they maintain, that Muhammad invented revelation.B. Nature of Muhammad’s DeathMuslim tradition holds that Muhammad’s death was ultimately natural, even though he suffered effects from poison. The mention of the aorta is metaphorical, describing the intensity of pain rather than a literal fulfillment of the Qur’anic warning.Scholarly References:Ibn KathirandTafsir al-Jalalaynboth emphasize the hypothetical nature of Qur’an 69:44–46.The poisoning incident (after the Battle of Khaybar) did not immediately cause Muhammad’s death, but only weakened him over time, according to most biographical sources.C. Prophet as MartyrSome Islamic scholars reinterpret Muhammad’s suffering from poison as a sign of his status as a martyr (shahid), rather than as evidence of falsity or divine punishment.D. Theological SafeguardsMuslims cite numerous other Qur’anic passages declaring Muhammad as a true prophet (e.g., Qur’an 33:40, 7:157).The verse is considered part of the Qur’an’s rhetorical style, warning not only Muhammad but all would-be false prophets throughout history.Rebuttal: Critical ReflectionsLiteral vs. Metaphorical:The Hadiths indicate that Muhammad himself invoked the language of the Qur’anic warning at his death. The coincidence invites further scrutiny as to whether this can be dismissed as merely metaphorical.Consistency of Standards:If a clear sign is given in scripture, and the sign is reportedly fulfilled, is it intellectually honest to reinterpret that sign only when it becomes problematic for doctrinal beliefs?Burden of Proof:If the Qur’an sets a test for a false prophet, should it not be applied consistently, even if the results are uncomfortable?ConclusionThis debate illustrates the complexity of interpreting scriptural texts and historical reports. The question remains deeply challenging:Does the conjunction of Qur’an 69:44–46 and Muhammad’s own death testimony suggest, by the Qur’an’s own standard, that he was a false prophet?Or does orthodox Islamic exegesis satisfactorily explain away the apparent contradiction?Scholars and seekers are encouraged to examine the evidence with intellectual honesty, utilizing rigorous critical methodologies and a commitment to truth.ReferencesThe Qur’an, Sahih International translation.Sahih Bukhari 5:59:713.Abu Dawud 34:4498.Tafsir Ibn Kathir, Tafsir al-Jalalayn.Sirat Ibn Ishaq, Al-Tabari’s History.Question for Further Debate:Should one accept a religious claim solely on faith, or must it be tested against the explicit standards set by its own scriptures?",

    "full_content": "EVIDENCE: ALLAH IS A CREATED BEING AND NOT THE ALMIGHTY GODBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Servant of Jesus ChristMax Shimba Ministries Org ©2015. All rights reserved.AbstractThis article critically examines Islamic descriptions of Allah as found in the Qur’an and authentic Hadith, analyzing anthropomorphic attributions such as face, garments, throne, hands, feet, and other bodily characteristics. Through detailed textual analysis, the article argues that such descriptions are fundamentally incompatible with the traditional concept of the Almighty God who is transcendent, incomparable, and uncreated. The work concludes by questioning the coherence of the Islamic portrayal of Allah in light of monotheistic theology.IntroductionThis subject is of profound significance for all who seek to understand the Islamic conception of God (Allah) and whether it aligns with the notion of the Almighty Creator or reveals Allah as a contingent, created being. Many Muslims assert that Allah is unlike any creature. However, Islamic texts repeatedly attribute human and creaturely characteristics to Allah. This study provides a critical exploration of such attributions as evidence that Allah, as described in Islamic sources, possesses features of created beings.1. Allah Possesses a Face Like Created BeingsQur’anic EvidenceSurah Al-Baqarah (2:115):“Wherever you turn, there is the Face of Allah.”This verse serves as a direct reply to those who deny that Allah possesses a face. Is not having a face a characteristic of human beings and creatures?Surah Al-Qasas (28:88):“Everything will perish except His Face.”Again, Allah openly affirms that He possesses a face, like created beings.2. Allah Wears Garments Like Created BeingsHadith EvidenceA Qudsi Hadith states:\"Pride is My upper garment, and majesty is My lower garment.\"If Allah is said to wear garments, does this not imply that He possesses a body like other creatures? This constitutes a significant theological problem.In another Qudsi Hadith, Allah says:“My servant draws near to Me with nothing more beloved to Me than the religious duties I have imposed upon him. My servant continues to draw near to Me with supererogatory works so that I shall love him. When I love him, I am his hearing with which he hears, his sight with which he sees, his hand with which he strikes, and his foot with which he walks.”Here, Allah admits to having ears, hands, eyes, and feet.3. Allah Sits on a Throne Like Created BeingsQur’anic EvidenceSurah Al-Haaqqah (69:17):“And the angels will be on its sides, and eight will, that Day, bear the Throne of your Lord above them.”Surah Al-Buruj (85:15):“Owner of the Throne, the Glorious.”If Allah possesses a throne, what purpose does it serve? Does Allah sit upon it as humans do? If He sits, does He have legs and feet like humans? If so, He is not different from created beings.Consider alsoSurah Al-Haaqqah (69:44-45):“And if he (Muhammad) had made up about Us some [false] sayings, We would have seized him by the right hand.”This indicates that Allah has a right hand. If Allah has a right hand, does He not also have a left? And if so, does He not also possess a mouth? Clearly, the doctrine that Allah is entirely incomparable becomes difficult to sustain.4. Allah Has Hands Like Created BeingsQur’anic and Hadith EvidenceSurah Az-Zumar (39:67):“They have not appraised Allah with true appraisal, while the earth entirely will be within His grip on the Day of Resurrection, and the heavens will be folded in His right hand.”Surah Al-Ma’idah (5:64):“The Jews say, ‘Allah’s hand is chained.’ May their hands be chained and cursed for what they say. Rather, both His hands are extended; He spends as He wills.”Surah Ya-Sin (36:83):“So exalted is He in whose hand is the realm of all things, and to Him you will be returned.”Surah Al Imran (3:26):“Say, ‘O Allah, Owner of Sovereignty, You give sovereignty to whom You will and You take sovereignty away from whom You will. You honor whom You will and You humble whom You will. In Your hand is [all] good. Indeed, You are over all things competent.’”Surah Sad (38:75):“[Allah] said, ‘O Iblis, what prevented you from prostrating to that which I created with My hands?’”Hadith literature further confirms these anthropomorphic descriptions, including traditions where Allah descends to the lowest heaven, stretches out His hands, and engages in conversations with prophets using His own hands.5. Allah Has Feet and Soles Like Created BeingsHadith and Classical CommentaryIslamic sources, including Sahih Bukhari, Sahih Muslim, Sunan Tirmidhi, Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal, and Tafsirs by Tabari, Ibn Kathir, and Suyuti, record narrations about Allah’s foot and sole.Abu Huraira narrated that the Prophet said:“Paradise and Hell argued... Thus Allah said to Paradise: ‘You are My mercy, through you I show mercy to those I will.’ And He said to Hell: ‘You are My punishment, through you I punish whom I will.’ Each will be filled, but Hell will not be satisfied until Allah places His Foot in it. Then it will say, ‘Enough, enough.’”If Hell will only be satisfied when Allah puts His Foot in it, does this not suggest Allah has a literal foot and is thus a being with form?6. Concluding ReflectionsFrom the above evidence, it becomes apparent that, as depicted in the Qur’an and Hadith, Allah is described in fundamentally anthropomorphic terms: He possesses a face, wears garments, sits on a throne, has hands, feet, and even bodily actions. This stands in sharp contrast with the biblical and classical philosophical view of God as wholly transcendent, immaterial, and utterly unlike His creation. The inescapable conclusion is that the Islamic conception of Allah, by its own scriptural testimony, renders Him a being not essentially different from created things.Final Questions to Muslim ReadersIf Allah is not a human or a created being, why does He repeatedly describe Himself using creaturely attributes?Why does Allah respond to Hell with His foot rather than with a word of authority alone?If Allah requires a throne and has bodily members, how does this not make Him a created being?May God bless you as you earnestly seek the truth.In His service,Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Servant of Jesus ChristMax Shimba Ministries Org ©2015.

    "full_content": "By Max Shimba, Servant of Jesus ChristShimba Theological Institute | Max Shimba Ministries Org ©2016IntroductionIn the previous installment, we firmly established that the God of the Bible possesses specific personal names, while the Islamic deity, Allah, as referenced in the Qur'an, is described through 99 attributes or names (Asma’ul Husna), as evidenced on Islamic educational platforms such as:https://www.islamicity.com/mosque/99names.htm.More importantly, we demonstrated that the term\"Allah\" is not a proper namebut atitleordesignation, comparable to the words “President” or “King.” Just as “President” is not a name but a position held by someone with an actual name—e.g., “President John Smith”—so too, \"Allah\" functions as a title and not a personal name.This leads us to the critical line of inquiry continued in this article:Is \"Allah\" a name or merely a descriptive title?And if he is truly the Most Merciful and the Most Compassionate, as Muslims often proclaim,what is his proper name?Islamic Invocation and Its ImplicationsMuslim sermons and invocations traditionally begin with the statement:“In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.”This immediately prompts an essential question:If God is “Most Gracious and Most Merciful,”what is His name?Titles such as “Gracious” and “Merciful” describe attributes, not names. Therefore, any rational theological inquiry should demand clarification:Two Critical Questions to MuslimsWhat is the personal name of the God whom you invoke as “Most Gracious and Most Merciful”?Please cite a Qur’anic verse clearly stating that name.If “Allah” is the actual proper name of God in Islam, can you provide a Qur’anic verse where God explicitly declares: “My name is Allah”?Appeal for Respectful DialogueDear Muslim friends, the objective of these questions is not to insult or provoke. We request that you refrain from harsh language, which unfortunately tends to follow such discussions. Instead, let us focus onintellectually rigorousandrespectful theological dialogue.What matters is your ability to substantiate your claim fromyour own Scripture—the Qur’an—and not simply repeat tradition.Biblical Revelation: God Reveals His NameIn sharp contrast to the ambiguity in the Qur'an regarding a personal name for Allah, theBible provides clear and direct revelations of God's name.Exodus 3:13–14 (KJV)records the following dialogue:“And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? What shall I say unto them?”And God said unto Moses, “I AM THAT I AM”: and he said, “Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel,I AMhath sent me unto you.”This profound declaration is bothontological and revelatory—God defines Himself as the self-existent one, the uncaused cause.Later, inExodus 6:2–3, we find:“And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the LORD:And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name ofGod Almighty, but by my nameJEHOVAHwas I not known to them.”This shows aprogressive revelationof God's personal name, which He discloses at the appropriate time to His covenant people.Contrast with Allah’s 99 NamesIt is indeed perplexing that “Allah,” despite having what are referred to as \"99 names\" in Islamic tradition, never disclosesa singular personal namein the Qur'an with the specificity found in the Judeo-Christian Scriptures.Furthermore, these so-called “names” are mostlyattributes or characteristics, not personal names in the linguistic or theological sense.An honest seeker must ask: If Allah is the God of Abraham, Moses, David, and Jesus as claimed, why is His name not revealed in the Torah, Psalms, or the Gospels? TheGod of the Bible does not hide His identity.Biblical Names of God: A Window into His NatureExploring the various names of God in the Bible gives us deeper insights into His nature. Consider the following:Elohim– The Mighty Creator (Genesis 1:1)Adonai– Lord, Master (Exodus 4:10,13)El Elyon– God Most High (Genesis 14:20)El Roi– The God Who Sees (Genesis 16:13)El Shaddai– God Almighty (Genesis 17:1)El Olam– The Everlasting God (Isaiah 40:28)YHWH (Yahweh)– “I AM,” the self-existent One (Exodus 3:13–14)These are not mere epithets—they are revelatorydisclosures of God's being and personhood, each deeply rooted in covenantal interaction with His people.ConclusionDear reader, even you—being human—possess a name. So why would the supreme God not reveal His name? The Islamic concept of Allah isabsent of personal self-disclosure. This is vastly different from the God of the Bible whopersonally reveals Himself, makescovenants, and communicates Hisnamesto His people.Therefore, we are compelled to conclude that “Allah” is not a personal name but ageneric title, and thusnot the sameasYahweh, the God of Moses, Abraham, David, and Jesus.Final BlessingMay God bless you as you seek the truth.I am,Max Shimba,Servant of Jesus Christ,For Max Shimba Ministries OrgNote:This document is permitted for reproduction and distributionin full and without modification.Max Shimba Ministries Org ©2016.

    "full_content": "The Myth of Islamic Claims to the Land of Israel: A Theological and Historical ReappraisalBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThe ongoing conflict over the Land of Israel remains one of the most contentious and misunderstood issues in contemporary religious, political, and academic discourse. Central to this debate is the persistent assertion from segments of the Muslim world regarding an alleged Islamic right to the Jewish homeland—a claim that, upon theological, historical, and textual scrutiny, proves to be both recent and ideologically motivated, rather than divinely or historically mandated.This article critically examines the foundations of Islamic claims to the Holy Land, the nature of Arab hostility toward the Jewish people and Israel, and the manipulation of religious identity and scripture for political objectives. In doing so, it seeks not only to address the misconceptions propagated in the Muslim world but also to liberate sincere Muslims from ideological bondage imposed by pan-Arabist and Islamist agendas.Historical Context: The Land of Israel and Its Ancient OwnershipHistorically, the Land of Israel—known biblically as Canaan, then as Judea and Israel—has been universally recognized as the ancestral homeland of the Jewish people. The Hebrew Bible, as well as subsequent Jewish, Christian, and even early Islamic traditions, affirm that God allocated this territory to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (see Genesis 17:8; Exodus 6:4).The notion that Israel was ever a fundamentally Muslim land before its allocation to the Jews is unsustainable. Prior to the seventh-century Arab conquests, neither the land nor its people were governed by Islamic law or identity. During the periods of Israelite, Judaean, Greek, Roman, and even Byzantine rule, the prevailing religions were Judaism and Christianity—not Islam. Indeed, Islam itself emerged in the Arabian Peninsula centuries after the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in the region.The transformation of the land's name from \"Judea\" to \"Palestina\" by the Romans after the Bar Kokhba revolt (135 CE) was not a reflection of indigenous Arab or Islamic heritage but a calculated act of erasure aimed at diminishing Jewish national identity.The Islamicization of the Israel-Palestine ConflictThe modern Islamic claim to the land is largely a product of twentieth-century political developments, rather than ancient religious entitlement. Prior to the 1948 establishment of the State of Israel, no independent Muslim state called \"Palestine\" ever existed; rather, the territory was administered variously by Ottoman Turks and then the British Mandate.As documented in the foundational charters of Arab and Palestinian organizations, the struggle against Israel has often been framed in overtly religious and annihilatory terms. The Palestinian National Charter, for example, asserts that \"Islam shall be the official religion in Palestine\" and that \"the principles of Islamic jurisprudence shall be the main source of legislation.\" The language of jihad and shariah is thus central to the ideology of contemporary Palestinian nationalism.Moreover, leaders such as Zohir Mohsen (PLO Executive Committee Member) have openly admitted that Palestinian national identity is a tactical construct serving the broader pan-Arab objective of confronting Zionism. In a 1977 interview with the Dutch newspaper Trouw, Mohsen stated, “There are no differences between Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians, and Lebanese. We are all part of one people, the Arab nation. Just for political reasons we carefully underwrite our Palestinian identity. Because it is of national interest for the Arabs to advocate the existence of Palestinians to balance Zionism. Yes, the existence of a separate Palestinian identity exists only for tactical reasons.”This candid admission undermines the narrative of an indigenous, continuous Palestinian people dispossessed by Zionism. Instead, it exposes the political use of identity to perpetuate hostility toward Jewish sovereignty.Islamic Theological Hostility Toward the JewsEnmity toward the Jewish people, as expressed in certain Islamic texts and later theological developments, is not inherent to Islam’s original message but rather evolved within specific historical contexts. While the Qur'an recounts theological disputes between Muhammad and the Jewish tribes of Arabia (e.g., Quran 2:40-61), there is no Quranic mandate for perpetual warfare against the Jews or for the exclusive Islamic ownership of the Land of Israel. Interpretations that promote such hostilities are influenced by later jurisprudential and polemical traditions rather than the core scriptural message.Notably, modern expressions of anti-Jewish hostility are often couched in language that fuses religious duty with Arab political ambitions. The rhetoric of organizations such as Hamas, Hizbollah, and others routinely frames the destruction of Israel as an Islamic imperative, thereby conflating Arab nationalism with universal Islamic obligations. This fusion is a relatively recent innovation and does not reflect the attitudes of earlier Islamic empires, many of which maintained diplomatic and even friendly relations with Jewish communities—including, notably, pre-revolutionary Iran.The Weaponization of Religion and the Path ForwardThe Islamic Revolution in Iran (1979) marked a turning point, with the Ayatollah Khomeini's regime imposing Islamist ideology and aligning Iran with pan-Islamic hostility toward Israel. Prior to this, Iran and Israel maintained cordial relations. The rise of jihadist organizations and the subsequent regionalization of the Israeli-Arab conflict are, therefore, not products of ancient hatreds but of modern political developments.Charters of Arab organizations explicitly reveal their goals: the annihilation of Israel and the subjugation of its land and people under Islamic law, as articulated in foundational documents and the statements of founding leaders. The Palestinian Charter, for example, insists on the establishment of Jerusalem as the capital of \"Palestine\" and the implementation of shariah, while early PLO documents refrained from claiming sovereignty over territories controlled by other Arab states, focusing solely on the destruction of Israel.ConclusionThe claim that there ever existed an independent Islamic nation known as \"Palestine\" is historically unfounded. The use of religious rhetoric to justify political violence against Israel serves to perpetuate enmity and obscures the true origins of the conflict: the refusal to accept Jewish sovereignty in the land historically and biblically allocated to them.For sincere Muslims, it is imperative to distinguish between genuine Islamic faith and the instrumentalization of religion for Arabist and jihadist agendas. Liberation from the ideological bondage of Arab nationalism cloaked in Islamic rhetoric is essential not only for peace in the region but for the integrity of the Islamic faith itself.Let us therefore seek truth over propaganda, peace over perpetual conflict, and faithfulness to the historical and theological record over the distortions of political expediency.ReferencesThe Holy Bible, Genesis 12–17; Exodus 6The Holy Qur'an, Surahs 2, 4, 5Palestinian National Charter, 1964, 1968Interview with Zohir Mohsen, Trouw, March 31, 1977Ahmed Al-Shuqairy,A Mandate for Terror, 1969Bernard Lewis,The Middle East: A Brief History of the Last 2,000 Years, 1995Martin Gilbert,Israel: A History, 1998",

    "full_content": "God Has Warned Us Not to Associate with JinnBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute / Max Shimba Ministries Org ©2016AbstractThis article provides a comparative theological examination between the Biblical teaching on demonic spirits (commonly called “jinn” in Islam) and the Islamic portrayal of jinn as beings capable of worshipping Allah and embracing Islam. Through scriptural references from the Bible and the Qur’an, the article exposes irreconcilable differences in theology, divine nature, and spiritual truth. The study reveals that while the Bible categorically forbids any relationship with spirits or jinn, the Qur’an incorporates jinn as part of the spiritual community of Muslims. This paper aims to equip readers with biblical discernment and offer a Christ-centered alternative to the Islamic worldview on jinn.1. Introduction: A Divine Warning Against SpiritismThe Bible offers clear guidance concerning the interaction between humans and spiritual beings, especially demonic spirits. Scripture repeatedly warns God’s people against consulting with mediums, necromancers, or engaging in any form of spiritism.\"Do not turn to mediums or necromancers; do not seek them out, and so make yourselves unclean by them: I am the LORD your God.\"—Leviticus 19:31 (ESV)God prohibited Israel from adopting pagan practices such as invoking spirits or engaging in occultism. The gravity of such practices is further emphasized:\"When you come into the land that the LORD your God is giving you, you shall not learn to follow the abominable practices of those nations... There shall not be found among you anyone who burns his son or his daughter as an offering, anyone who practices divination or tells fortunes or interprets omens... For whoever does these things is an abomination to the LORD.\"—Deuteronomy 18:9–122. Biblical Exposition on the Nature of Demons (Jinn)The Bible gives insights into the origin, identity, and final destiny of demons. They are fallen angels, formerly in heaven, cast down due to rebellion against God:\"Now war arose in heaven, Michael and his angels fighting against the dragon... And the great dragon was thrown down, that ancient serpent, who is called the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world—he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.\"—Revelation 12:7–9These beings (calledshedimin Hebrew ordaimoniain Greek) are unclean spirits that seek to deceive and inhabit people. Jesus Christ consistently demonstrated His divine authority by casting out demons:\"As we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a slave girl who had a spirit of divination... But Paul, greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, 'I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.' And it came out that very hour.\"—Acts 16:16–183. Islamic Theology: Jinn as Believers and MuslimsIn stark contrast, Islamic theology not only acknowledges the existence of jinn but also asserts that some jinn have converted to Islam and serve Allah. The Qur’an even devotes an entire chapter (Surah Al-Jinn) to this concept.\"Say: It has been revealed to me that a group of the jinn listened and said, 'Indeed, we have heard an amazing Qur’an. It guides to the right course, and we have believed in it...'\"—Qur’an 72:1–2The Qur’an goes further to claim that jinn were created for the purpose of worshipping Allah:\"I did not create jinn and mankind except to worship Me.\"—Qur’an 51:56Additionally, Qur’an 6:130 explicitly states that Allah sent messengers to both humans and jinn:\"O company of jinn and mankind, did there not come to you messengers from among you, relating to you My verses and warning you of the meeting of this Day of yours?\"—Qur’an 6:130These statements raise significant theological contradictions when compared to the Biblical God, who rejects communion with unclean spirits.4. The Biblical God Versus the Allah of the Qur’anIn Christianity, demons (jinn) are unredeemable, fallen beings awaiting judgment. Their end is in eternal fire:\"And the devil who had deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur where the beast and the false prophet were... And if anyone’s name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.\"—Revelation 20:10, 15Yet in the Qur’an, these same spiritual entities are said to have believed, worshipped, and inherited paradise (Akhira). This poses fundamental theological dissonance. For example:InQur’an 72:14, it is claimed that believing jinn will enter paradise.InQur’an 6:128, Allah promises hellfire to many humans and jinn collectively.5. Jesus and Jinn: The Irrefutable AuthorityJesus never allied with demons. He consistently rebuked, silenced, and cast them out with divine authority. This clearly sets Him apart from the Qur’anic view where Muhammad is surrounded by and served by jinn:\"And demons also came out of many, crying, 'You are the Son of God!' But he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.\"—Luke 4:41Jesus’ relationship with demons is one of conflict and dominion—not tolerance or cooperation.6. The Quranic Paradox: Paradise or Hell for Jinn?There is deep ambiguity in Islamic eschatology regarding the final destiny of jinn. Though the Qur’an claims that righteous jinn may inherit paradise, it also says they are companions in hell with sinful humans:\"He will say, 'Enter among nations who had passed away before you of jinn and mankind into the Fire.'\"—Qur’an 6:128This contradiction further problematizes the Islamic portrayal of jinn as spiritually redeemable beings.7. Theological Reflection: Can God Be Friends with Demons?In the Bible, those who consult with spirits were to be executed (Leviticus 20:27). God declared such practices as defilement and rebellion. Yet Islam incorporates jinn into its spiritual framework as worshippers and even companions of prophets. This reveals a profound theological discrepancy.If Jesus casts out jinn (demons), how can Allah embrace them?Conclusion: Choose the God of the BibleThe evidence is clear:The God of the Bible forbids and judges communion with demons.Jesus casts them out with authority, offering spiritual freedom.Allah, in contrast, embraces jinn as Muslim believers and even assigns them prophets.This contrast compels every seeker of truth to decide:Will you follow the Holy God who delivers from demonic power, or a god who accepts jinn as part of his spiritual family?\"I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.\"—John 14:6 (Jesus Christ)Call to ActionDear reader, the truth is not hidden. Flee from unclean spirits and spiritual deception. Run to Jesus—the only One who conquers the powers of darkness. In Him is light, salvation, and eternal life.Come to Jesus Christ—the only way to Heaven.God bless you abundantly.Dr. Maxwell ShimbaServant of the Lord Jesus ChristFor Max Shimba Ministries Org©2016.

    "full_content": "Title: The Theological Crisis of Shared Divine Attributes in Islam: Unveiling the Islamic DilemmaBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis paper explores the theological inconsistencies within Islamic doctrine by focusing on the shared use of divine attributes—specifically\"An-Nur\" (The Light)—between Allah and Muhammad. In Islam, the 99 Names of Allah are said to be uniquely divine and exclusive. Yet, Islamic tradition ascribes the title \"An-Nur\" not only to Allah but also to Muhammad, raising critical theological questions. This scholarly article contends that such overlap reflects a profound internal contradiction within Islamic monotheism and argues that the cessation of divine revelation after Muhammad's death indicates thatMuhammad functioned as the voice and persona of Allah, thereby collapsing the distinction between the messenger and the deity he proclaimed.IntroductionIslam presents itself as a strictly monotheistic faith, asserting the oneness and incomparability of Allah (Tawheed). Central to this claim are the 99 Names of Allah—attributes believed to uniquely define His essence. Yet, an examination of Islamic sources reveals that some of these divine names are simultaneously attributed to Muhammad. Among the most striking examples is \"An-Nur\" (The Light), a title found both in Allah’s names and among the epithets of Muhammad. This shared attribute invites serious theological scrutiny and casts doubt on Islam’s claim of a clear demarcation between the Creator and the created.The Shared Attribute: An-Nur (The Light)TheQur’an (24:35)describes Allah as “the Light of the heavens and the earth,” a powerful and exclusive claim. “An-Nur” is thus recognized as one of the most revered of Allah’s names. However, Islamic literature—including Hadith and prophetic biographies—frequently refers to Muhammad as “An-Nur,” “Siraj al-Muneer” (Illuminating Lamp), and “Misbah” (Lamp), terms that functionally overlap with the divine title.Why would a religion so insistent on monotheism and divine transcendence allow such a sacred attribute to be duplicated in a created being?If “An-Nur” is unique to Allah, then ascribing it to Muhammad isshirk(associating others with God)—a sin that the Qur’an deems unforgivable (Surah 4:48). Yet, if Muhammadcanrightly bear this attribute, it blurs the boundary between deity and man, pointing to a deeper theological confusion.Is Muhammad Allah? The Question of RevelationAnother glaring issue is thetotal silence of Allah post-Muhammad. For a God described as “Ever-Speaking” (al-Kalim), the end of revelation at Muhammad’s death suggests an anthropocentric dependency. Christianity, by contrast, teaches that God speaks across covenants and through various prophets and ultimately through His Son. But in Islam,Allah's voice ceases the moment Muhammad dies.This naturally raises the question: Was Allah simply Muhammad’s projection? The halt in divine speech implies thatAllah had no voice apart from Muhammad’s, making it plausible thatMuhammad was himself the embodiment, or fabrication, of Allah. The divine ceased to exist in communicative form after the prophet’s death, reinforcing the idea that Islam was aman-centered invention rather than a God-centered revelation.Theological Implications and ContradictionsViolation of Divine UniquenessIslam teaches that Allah has no equals or partners (Surah 112). Yet calling Muhammad “An-Nur,” a name reserved for Allah, directly challenges this teaching. Either Muhammad shares in divinity, or the uniqueness of Allah is compromised.The Prophet as the DeityThe Qur’an never explicitly states that Muhammad isonlya man. Combined with the elevated honorifics and cessation of revelation posthumously, this opens the door to interpreting Muhammad not as a prophetofAllah, but a manifestationasAllah.Post-Muhammad Silence of AllahNo further messengers, no more books, no more prophecies—just silence. If Allah is eternal and unchanging, why would His revelations stop with one man? This suggests the message was tied not to God, but to the life and influence of a singular individual—Muhammad.ConclusionThe theological issues presented by the shared title of “An-Nur” and the silence of Allah after Muhammad’s death challenge the very foundations of Islam. These contradictions expose the possibility that Islam is not a divine religion, but aman-made systemcarefully constructed to place Muhammad at the center—not only as a messenger but as the personification of Allah.In conclusion, thecollapse of divine distinction,shared divine attributes, andposthumous divine silenceserve as compelling evidence that Muhammad was, in the structure of Islam, effectivelyAllah in disguise. Thus,Islam fails the test of theological coherenceand cannot be sustained as an authentic monotheistic revelation.About the AuthorDr. Maxwell Shimba is a leading Restorative Justice practitioner, Bible scholar, and founder of the USA Theological University in Florida.

    "full_content": "Inconsistencies in the Qur’an Regarding the Days of Creation: Six Days or Eight Days?By Dr. Maxwell Shimba | Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis article critically examines one of the theological and textual inconsistencies found within the Qur’an concerning the number of days it took Allah to create the heavens and the earth. While the Islamic scripture, in several verses, affirms a six-day creation account, a careful reading of other passages suggests an eight-day sequence. This discrepancy has sparked significant debate among classical and modern Muslim exegetes. The paper presents a scholarly analysis of these conflicting accounts, their implications for Qur’anic inerrancy, and the broader theological consequences for the doctrine of divine omniscience within Islamic thought.IntroductionOne of the fundamental narratives shared across the Abrahamic faiths is the account of the creation of the world. In the Bible, the book of Genesis outlines a clear six-day creation, with God resting on the seventh day. The Qur’an, which claims to affirm the previous revelations (Torah and Gospel) while correcting alleged distortions, also addresses the creation narrative. However, a textual analysis of various Qur’anic passages reveals inconsistencies in the reported number of days required for creation. Some verses affirm six days, while others, when read cumulatively, suggest eight days. This raises important questions regarding the internal consistency of the Qur’an, a text Muslims hold to be the uncreated, perfect word of Allah.The Qur’anic Six-Day Creation VersesSeveral Qur’anic passages explicitly state that the heavens and the earth were created in six days:Surah Al-A’raf (7:54)“Indeed, your Lord is Allah, who created the heavens and the earth in six days; then He established Himself above the Throne.”Surah Yunus (10:3)“Indeed, your Lord is Allah, who created the heavens and the earth in six days and then established Himself above the Throne.”Surah Hud (11:7)“And it is He who created the heavens and the earth in six days – and His Throne had been upon water.”Surah Al-Furqan (25:59)“He who created the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them in six days, then established Himself above the Throne – the Most Merciful.”These verses unambiguously affirm a six-day creation timeline, aligning superficially with the biblical narrative.The Eight-Day Creation Dilemma: Surah Fussilat 41:9-12A significant contradiction appears inSurah Fussilat (41:9-12):41:9“Say, ‘Do you indeed disbelieve in He who created the earth in two days and attribute to Him equals? That is the Lord of the worlds.’”41:10“And He placed on it firmly set mountains over its surface, and He blessed it and determined therein its sustenance in four days, without distinction – for those who ask.”41:11-12“Then He directed Himself to the heaven while it was smoke and said to it and to the earth, ‘Come willingly or by compulsion.’ They said, ‘We have come willingly.’ And He completed them as seven heavens within two days and inspired in each heaven its command.”Breakdown of Days:Creation of Earth:2 days(41:9)Formation of mountains, blessings, sustenance:4 days(41:10)Formation of the heavens:2 days(41:12)Total: 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 daysThus, according to this passage, creation required eight days — contradicting the multiple earlier declarations of a six-day creation period.Exegetical Attempts at ReconciliationMuslim exegetes, both classical and contemporary, have grappled with this apparent inconsistency. Some notable interpretations include:Sequential versus Simultaneous Days:Some scholars suggest that the four days mentioned in verse 41:10 include the initial two days of creating the earth — meaning the sustenance and mountains’ arrangement tooktwo additional days, not four. This interpretation, however, conflicts with the straightforward Arabic phrasing, which numerically distinguishes the periods.Ambiguity in Arabic Syntax:Another argument claims that the Arabic construction allows for overlap or non-sequential counting. However, this introduces arbitrary flexibility to the reading and undermines the clarity of the Qur’anic narrative.Divine Days versus Human Days:A common apologetic is that \"days\" in God’s reckoning are not equal to human days (cf. Qur'an 22:47, 32:5). Yet this does not address the numerical inconsistency but only their duration, leaving the total count unresolved.Implications for Qur’anic InerrancyThe doctrine ofi‘jaz al-Qur’an(the inimitability and perfection of the Qur’an) holds that the scripture is free of contradiction. The apparent discrepancy between a six-day and an eight-day creation narrative poses a challenge to this claim. If the Qur’an cannot maintain numerical consistency in a fundamental theological account, it undermines its asserted divine authorship and perfection.Furthermore, the Qur’an claims:“Do they not then reflect on the Qur’an? If it had been from other than Allah, they would have found within it much contradiction.”(Surah An-Nisa 4:82)By its standard, the inconsistency in the number of creation days invites scrutiny regarding the divine origin of the text.Comparison with the Biblical AccountThe Bible maintains a coherent six-day creation narrative inGenesis 1, with each day’s activity carefully delineated and the seventh day set aside for rest. Despite differences in cosmology, the biblical narrative remains internally consistent — a sharp contrast to the Qur’an’s conflicting timelines.ConclusionThe Qur’anic narrative on the creation of the world suffers from a significant internal inconsistency regarding the number of days involved in the act of creation. While some verses clearly state a six-day timeline, a detailed reading ofSurah Fussilat 41:9-12cumulatively suggests an eight-day process. Muslim exegetical attempts to reconcile this contradiction either stretch the natural reading of the Arabic text or introduce speculative theological constructs.This inconsistency raises serious questions about the Qur’an’s claim of being free from contradictions and perfectly preserved. It further challenges the Islamic doctrine of Allah’s omniscience and the Qur’an’s status as the uncreated, flawless word of God.About the AuthorDr. Maxwell Shimbais a theologian, biblical scholar, and director of theShimba Theological Institute.

    "full_content": "The Thirty-Two Sins of Muhammad: A Scholarly Theological ExposéBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractMuhammad, founder of Islam, is venerated as the final prophet and an exemplary moral leader by Muslims. Yet a rigorous theological and historical inquiry, especially when set against biblical ethical paradigms, reveals profound inconsistencies in his teachings and conduct. This paper critically analyzes thirty-two moral and theological failings attributed to Muhammad, engaging both Islamic primary sources and critical scholarship, to assess their implications for the claim of prophetic legitimacy.1.Institution of Veiling (Hijab) Not Ordained by GodThe Qur'an’s prescription for veiling (Q 33:59) is absent from prior Abrahamic scriptures and is argued by critics to reflect social control rather than divine ordinance. Scholars such as Cook (2001) observe that the imposition of hijab is neither universal in pre-Islamic Arabia nor part of Christian/Jewish law, raising questions about its revelatory status1.2.Ordinance of PolygamyUnlike New Testament ethics which uphold monogamy (1 Tim. 3:2), Muhammad allowed men up to four wives (Q 4:3), and for himself, an even broader sexual prerogative (Q 33:50). Peters (1994) notes that the Qur’anic basis for polygamy facilitated rapid population growth and social alliances, but its divine origin is contestable2.3.Exclusive Sexual PrivilegesThe Qur’an provides Muhammad with unique marital exemptions (Q 33:50–51), allowing him to marry any woman who offered herself to him, a privilege denied even to his followers. Ibn Ishaq records multiple instances of these personal revelations3. Critics regard this as self-serving and ethically problematic.4.Revelations Driven by LustNumerous Qur’anic revelations seem tailored to Muhammad’s immediate desires, especially regarding marriage and sexual relations (e.g., Q 33:37, legitimizing his marriage to Zaynab, his adopted son’s ex-wife). Watt (1956) and others discuss the apologetic responses and the moral ambiguities involved4.5.Sexual Enslavement of CaptivesAfter the Battle of Khaybar, Muhammad took Safiyya bint Huyayy as a concubine (Ibn Ishaq, p. 511; Bukhari 5:59:512). The permissibility of sexual relations with female captives (Q 4:24) is widely attested. Modern scholars universally critique this as a violation of contemporary and biblical moral norms5.6.Women's Testimony Valued as HalfQur’an 2:282 explicitly states that a woman’s testimony is worth half that of a man’s. This legal provision institutionalizes gender inequality, diverging sharply from the Christian doctrine of equality in Christ (Galatians 3:28) and from the Old Testament’s evolving ethics6.7.Sanctioning Wife-BeatingQur’an 4:34 authorizes husbands to “strike” their wives as a last resort in marital disputes. This has led to extensive controversy in both Islamic and non-Islamic contexts, with attempts at reinterpretation failing to mask the plain sense of the text7.8.Initiation of Caravan RaidingThe first Muslim attack on a Meccan caravan at Nakhla occurred during a sacred month (Ibn Ishaq, pp. 286–288), violating Arabian tradition. This action established a precedent for jihad as offensive warfare for material gain, which is ethically and theologically contestable8.9.Assassination of CriticsHistorical accounts record Muhammad ordering the assassination of poets who criticized him, such as Asma bint Marwan and Ka’b ibn al-Ashraf (Ibn Ishaq, pp. 676–682). These acts, justified as “defending the faith,” are inconsistent with the prophetic forbearance in the biblical tradition9.10.Refusal to Reconcile with Jews and ChristiansQur’anic hostility towards Jews and Christians (Q 5:51; 9:29–30) and Muhammad’s actions during his Medinan years show an unwillingness to foster reconciliation, contrary to the biblical imperative for peace with all people (Romans 12:18)10.11.Participation in the Massacre of Banu QurayzaAfter the siege of Banu Qurayza, sources agree that Muhammad authorized and possibly participated in the beheading of approximately 600–900 Jewish men (Ibn Ishaq, pp. 461–464; Bukhari 5:59:362). This massacre remains a central critique of his moral legacy11.12.Authorizing Murder of Non-BelieversNumerous Qur’anic verses (e.g., Q 9:5; 9:29) and hadiths call for the killing of unbelievers, especially during the post-Hijra period. This is sharply at odds with the biblical injunction to love one’s enemies (Matthew 5:44)12.13.Anti-Semitic RhetoricMuhammad is recorded as referring to Jews as “apes and pigs” (Q 2:65; 5:60). Such derogatory rhetoric has fueled centuries of anti-Semitism in Islamic societies (Lewis, 1984)13.14.Failure to Correct Corrupt LawsAccording to Zahid Khan and some critical Muslim traditions, Muhammad allegedly refused divine requests to amend or retract self-serving or harsh laws he had issued, raising the issue of prophetic fallibility and moral flexibility14.15.Refusal to Limit MarriagesDespite alleged divine commands to divorce excess wives (beyond the four permitted for Muslims), Muhammad retained his privileges (Q 33:52), further highlighting the personal exemption principle15.16.Refusal to Unite with ChristianityKhan claims that Muhammad was divinely requested to seek unity with the Christian church but chose religious exclusivism (Q 9:33; 61:9). No explicit record exists in Islamic sources, but the trajectory of his later revelations supports this exclusivist approach16.17.Religious Supremacism and IntoleranceMuhammad’s later revelations increasingly declare the supremacy of Islam and the need to suppress other faiths (Q 9:33). This contrasts with early Meccan tolerance and with the pluralism of biblical prophecy (Isaiah 56:7)17.18.Refusal to Seek Interfaith UnityDespite Qur’anic statements inviting People of the Book to common terms (Q 3:64), Muhammad’s actual policies led to the subjugation and marginalization of Jews and Christians in Arabia18.19.Expansionist Marital PolicyThe legal allowance for four wives, with the purpose of quickly increasing the Muslim population, is seen as strategic rather than ethical (Peters, 1994)19.20.Claims of Seeing God’s Form Without WitnessMuhammad’s ascension (mi’raj) claims private visionary experiences (Bukhari 5:58:227), but these were never witnessed or corroborated, raising epistemological and prophetic legitimacy questions20.21.Refusal of Religious Partnership with JesusIslamic theology positions Muhammad as the “Seal of the Prophets” (Q 33:40), but polemical literature accuses him of refusing collaboration with Jesus, whose status in Christianity is unique and unshared (Q 4:171)21.22.Creation of a New ReligionTraditions suggest that Muhammad’s divergence from both Judaism and Christianity resulted in a new religious system, despite the Qur’an’s claims of continuity (Q 2:135). Some Islamic apologists accept this as divine innovation, while critics see it as opportunistic22.23.Ignoring Gabriel’s CounselSeveral hadiths record Muhammad being admonished by Gabriel for mistakes or omissions (e.g., Bukhari 1:1:3), but critics allege selective or self-serving obedience23.24.Refusal to Edit Out His Own VersesCritical tradition claims Muhammad was requested by God to remove certain personal or harsh verses but refused, challenging the Islamic doctrine of the Qur’an’s divine perfection24.25.Responsibility for Arab-Israeli HostilitySome scholars, such as Lewis (1984), trace modern Arab-Jewish conflict to Muhammad’s precedent of hostility toward Jews, particularly through the events in Medina25.26.Exiling Jewish TribesMuhammad’s expulsion of Banu Qaynuqa and Banu Nadir and the massacre of Banu Qurayza are well-documented (Ibn Ishaq, pp. 437–464). These acts have been critiqued as ethnic cleansing26.27.Lack of Compassion for JewsDespite Qur’anic claims that “there is no compulsion in religion” (Q 2:256), Muhammad’s actions towards Jewish tribes were devoid of reconciliation or compassion27.28.Ordering Death of Rival ProphetsMuhammad allegedly ordered the death of Musaylimah and other rival prophets during the Wars of Apostasy (Ridda), establishing a violent standard for religious leadership28.29.Extracting Harsh Laws from Older TraditionsMuhammad implemented legal punishments (stoning, amputation, lashing) drawn from pre-Islamic and Old Testament laws, but without the redemptive context found in later biblical revelation29.30.Triple Talaq DivorceMuhammad sanctioned divorce by pronouncement of “talaq” three times (Bukhari 7:63:197), a practice later regarded as detrimental to women’s rights even within Muslim reform movements30.31.Prohibition of Marrying His WidowsQur’an 33:53 forbids Muslims from marrying Muhammad’s widows, motivated by concern for his posthumous reputation. This contrasts with Old Testament and Christian traditions, which provide for widows’ remarriage31.32.Misleading Promises of Heavenly RewardsThe Qur’anic promise of “virgins” for martyrs (Q 56:22–24; 78:31–33) has been interpreted as temporally limited by some critics, yet Muhammad did not clarify this, leading to centuries of doctrinal confusion and extremism32.ConclusionEach of the thirty-two points elaborated above is supported by primary Islamic sources and examined through the lens of critical, interfaith, and biblical ethics. This comprehensive review reveals deep tensions between Muhammad’s legacy and the ethical standards of prophetic monotheism. The imperative for open academic discourse on these matters remains vital for genuine understanding and interfaith relations.ReferencesThis expanded academic exposé is suitable for theological, historical, or interfaith studies journals.

This article examines the admissions of sinfulness by the Prophet Muhammad as reported in Islamic tradition, contrasts it with the biblical testimony concerning the sinlessness of Jesus Christ, and discusses the theological implications for forgiveness and salvation.Muhammad’s Repeated Pleas for ForgivenessAccording to Islamic primary sources, Prophet Muhammad frequently sought forgiveness from God, indicating a consciousness of sin. The hadith recorded inSahih Muslimstates:“Al-Agharr al-Muzani, who was one of the Companions, reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: ‘There is sometimes a shade upon my heart, and I seek forgiveness from Allah a hundred times a day.’”(Sahih Muslim, Book 35, Hadith 6522)The expression “a shade upon my heart” is understood by classical and modern Islamic scholars as an acknowledgment of spiritual imperfection or a lingering sense of guilt. Notably, Muhammad’s need to seek forgiveness a hundred times a day stands as a testament to his acute awareness of his own moral shortcomings.The Qur’an, on the other hand, exalts Muhammad’s character, stating:“And indeed, you are of a great moral character.”(Qur’an 68:4, translation by Muhammad Knut Bernström)This verse has been interpreted to emphasize Muhammad’s exemplary nature. Yet, the persistent seeking of forgiveness recorded in authentic hadith traditions seems to be in tension with the claim of moral perfection, raising important theological questions.Universal Sinfulness According to the BibleChristian doctrine asserts that all humans are sinners. The Apostle Paul affirms:“For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.”(Romans 3:23, ESV)This universal declaration of sinfulness includes all individuals—prophets and common people alike. If Muhammad is to be included in this universal category, then his repeated pleas for forgiveness are to be expected from a biblical perspective.Did Muhammad’s Sins Receive Forgiveness?In his bookEnd of the Line, Reza Safa reports a tradition where Muhammad’s wife Khadija asked him if his sins were forgiven. Muhammad replied that he was not sure whether his own sins were forgiven. This uncertainty is significant because it reveals a lack of assurance regarding divine pardon, even for Islam’s preeminent prophet.The Sinlessness of Jesus ChristIn stark contrast, the New Testament asserts unequivocally the sinlessness of Jesus Christ. The Epistle to the Hebrews declares:“For we do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are—yet he did not sin.”(Hebrews 4:15, NIV)Because Jesus was without sin, He was uniquely qualified to serve as the savior and mediator between God and humanity. The Bible teaches that through His sacrificial death on the cross, Jesus took upon Himself the sins of the world (cf. 1 Peter 2:22-24; 2 Corinthians 5:21).Theological ImplicationsThe significance of these facts is profound. Jesus’ sinlessness enables Him to forgive sins and offer salvation, something Muhammad, by his own admission and Islamic testimony, could not claim for himself. The assurance of salvation and forgiveness in Christianity is grounded in the perfection of Christ, whereas Muhammad’s example is one of continual repentance without certain assurance.ConclusionIn conclusion, both Islamic and Christian scriptures acknowledge the reality of human sinfulness. However, only in the person of Jesus Christ does the claim of absolute sinlessness stand, qualifying Him as the savior of humanity. Muslims and all people are therefore invited to come to the Living Jesus, who has the authority and power to forgive sins and grant eternal life.ReferencesSahih Muslim, Book 35, Hadith 6522.

    "full_content": "Challenging the Omniscience of Allah: A Critical Theological AnalysisBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteAbstractThe Islamic doctrine traditionally asserts that Allah is omniscient, possessing perfect and complete knowledge of all things, past, present, and future. However, certain passages in the Quran, when examined critically and in their Arabic context, appear to suggest a process of discovery or testing on Allah’s part, implying limits to His knowledge. This paper scrutinizes these verses, especiallySurah al-Baqarah 2:143, and corroborating statements from Sahih Hadith, to interrogate the classical claim of Allah’s omniscience. The analysis situates the discussion within broader Abrahamic theology, comparing the Quranic depiction of divine knowledge with the biblical and Christian tradition.IntroductionThe nature of God’s knowledge is central to the theology of monotheistic religions. While the Bible affirms the omniscience of YHWH (Psalm 139:1–6; Hebrews 4:13), Islamic orthodoxy asserts the same for Allah. Nevertheless, critical examination of the Quran reveals verses that may undermine this doctrine. This article focuses on such instances, raising important questions about the consistency and coherence of Allah's omniscience as presented in Islamic scripture and hadith.1. Quranic Passages Suggesting a Lack of Omniscience1.1 Surah al-Baqarah 2:143The verse states:“We decreed the Qiblah which you faced before, that We may know who follows the Apostle and who turn away in haste…”(Quran 2:143, Ahmed Ali translation)The Arabic:“…وَمَا جَعَلْنَا الْقِبْلَةَ الَّتِي كُنتَ عَلَيْهَا إِلَّا لِنَعْلَمَ مَن يَتَّبِعُ الرَّسُولَ مِمَّن يَنقَلِبُ عَلَىٰ عَقِبَيْهِ…”Critical Analysis:The expression“لِنَعْلَمَ”(“so that We may know”) indicates a purpose clause. The plain reading suggests that Allah needed tocreate a test in order to gain knowledge—knowledge He would not otherwise have had. This language implies a form ofepistemic limitationon Allah’s part, which stands in contrast to the doctrine of exhaustive foreknowledge.1.2 Similar Passages in the QuranQuran 3:140:“…so that Allah may know those who believe…”Quran 29:2-3:“Do men think that they will be left alone on saying, ‘We believe’, and that they will not be tested? We did test those before them, so that Allah may know those who are true and those who are false.”In each case, the verb“يَعْلَمَ”(“may know”) is used in a manner that indicates discovery after a process, not prior omniscience.2. Interpretations from Classical TafsirMany classical Muslim exegetes (mufassirun) attempt to resolve this apparent theological problem. Al-Tabari, Ibn Kathir, and others argue that “so that We may know” is to be understoodmetaphorically, meaning “so that it may be known” to others or “so that it becomes manifest.” However, this is atheological glossand not the most immediate sense of the Arabic phrase. The Quran’s repeated use oftesting for knowledgeremains problematic.3. Evidence from Sahih Hadith3.1 Allah’s Regret or SurpriseSahih al-Bukhari 6619:“Allah wonders at those people who will enter Paradise in chains.”Here, Allah “wonders,” a term implying surprise or lack of foreknowledge.Sahih Muslim 2751:“Allah laughs at two men, one of whom kills the other yet both enter Paradise.”Laughter and wonder, in this anthropomorphic sense, are not typically attributed to an omniscient being in classical theism.4. Comparison with the Christian TraditionThe Christian Bible repeatedly affirms God’s perfect knowledge:Psalm 147:5:“Great is our Lord and mighty in power; his understanding has no limit.”1 John 3:20:“…God is greater than our heart, and He knows everything.”Unlike the Quran, there is no verse in the New Testament or Old Testament where Godtests in order to learnsomething previously unknown to Him.5. Academic DiscussionModern Islamic scholars (see: Fazlur Rahman, “Major Themes of the Quran”; W.M. Watt, “Islamic Philosophy and Theology”) admit that anthropomorphic language is present in the Quran, but tend to allegorize it. Nonetheless, such approaches raise questions abouttextual clarityanddoctrinal consistency.ConclusionBased on the evidence presented, the Quran and certain Sahih Hadith contain passages that, at leastprima facie, suggest Allah acquires knowledge through tests and events. While Islamic tradition strives to harmonize these with divine omniscience, the explicit wording remains challenging for the doctrine of Allah’s absolute knowledge. In contrast, the Christian scriptural portrayal of divine omniscience is unambiguous and consistent.References & BibliographyThe Holy Quran(trans.

    "full_content": "A Critical Examination of Prophethood in Light of Biblical and Islamic ClaimsBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba | Max Shimba Ministries Org.AbstractThis article examines the prophetic claims of Muhammad in contrast with biblical prophets. While all biblical prophets had direct encounters and conversations with God, the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, according to Islamic sources and the Qur’an, never claimed a direct conversation with Allah. Instead, his call to prophethood is rooted in psychological experiences and familial assurance, particularly from his wife, Khadija. This paper analyzes Islamic texts and compares Muhammad’s experience with the biblical paradigm of authentic prophethood, concluding with a call to re-examine the basis of Muhammad’s authority.IntroductionThroughout history, the role of a prophet has carried profound religious and spiritual significance. The biblical tradition, both Old and New Testament, affirms that true prophets have a direct encounter or dialogue with God (cf. Exodus 3:1–21; 1 Kings 19; Acts 18:9). However, the claim of Muhammad as a prophet in Islam raises critical questions, especially when contrasted with the prophetic narratives of the Bible. This paper revisits these claims and scrutinizes the basis of Muhammad’s prophethood using both Islamic and Christian sources.The Meaning of the Word “Prophet”The Swahili term“mtume”is derived from the concept of a “messenger” or “one who is sent.” In biblical context, an apostle or prophet is not only sent by God but also engages in direct communion with the Divine (see Exodus 3:4; 1 Samuel 3:4; Isaiah 6:8). This standard of direct encounter forms a critical criterion for authentic prophethood.Muhammad’s Prophetic Experience: An Analysis1. Muhammad Was Not Sent by GodThere is no verse in the Qur’an that unequivocally states Muhammad spoke directly with Allah, the one who allegedly appointed him as a prophet.[1] Unlike Moses, Elijah, or Paul—each of whom had direct divine conversations (Exodus 3:1–21; 1 Kings 19; Acts 18:9)—Muhammad’s revelations came through intermediary experiences, most notably the angel Jibril (Gabriel), and never a personal encounter with Allah.2. Muhammad Was Appointed by His WifeIslamic tradition reports that following his first revelatory experiences in the cave of Hira, Muhammad returned home in terror and confusion, fearing for his sanity and well-being. It was Khadija, his wife, who reassured him, allegedly declaring,“Rejoice, O son of my uncle, and be of good heart. By Him in whose hand is Khadija’s soul, I hope that you will be the Prophet of this people.”(Ibn Ishaq, Sirat Rasul Allah)Thus, Muhammad’s prophethood was initially affirmed by familial encouragement rather than a direct, public commission from God.3. Muhammad’s Experiences with Demonic ForcesIslamic sources themselves narrate that Muhammad was plagued by experiences that he interpreted as being under the influence of evil spirits (jinn or shayatin) from childhood and during his first “revelation.”Born with Satan:Abu Huraira narrated that, “The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) was accompanied by a devil since his birth…”(Fath al-Bari, Volume 6, p. 389)Tormented by Spirits:After his first experience in the cave, Muhammad was reported to have said,“I fear for myself, I am afraid that something may happen to me,”and fell into convulsions and fever, fearing possession by demons.(Kitab al-Kubra an-Nisa, p. 12)The Biblical Model: Prophets Who Spoke With GodAll authentic prophets in the biblical narrative spoke with God directly:Moses: Spoke with God face to face (Exodus 3:1–21).Elijah: Dialogued with God on Mount Horeb (1 Kings 19).Paul: The risen Christ appeared and spoke to him (Acts 18:9).No biblical prophet received their commission through mere intermediaries or through psychological crises alone.Critical Questions for Islamic ProphethoodIf Muhammad never spoke directly with Allah, how can his prophetic authority be substantiated? What is the basis of his calling? How can one trust a messenger who was plagued by doubts and fears, whose prophetic claim was affirmed by his wife rather than God?ConclusionThe evidence from both the Qur’an and Islamic traditions themselves casts serious doubt on the legitimacy of Muhammad’s prophethood when compared to the biblical model. The absence of direct communication with God, psychological disturbances, and familial affirmation rather than divine calling are issues that must be addressed by those who seek truth. Christians are called to place their faith in Jesus Christ—the Living and Supreme God—who has spoken clearly in history.ReferencesQur’an: Nowhere does the Qur’an record a direct conversation between Muhammad and Allah.Ibn Ishaq, Sirat Rasul Allah: The earliest biography of Muhammad, reports the reassurance given by Khadija.Fath al-Bari(فتح الباري), Commentary on Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 6, p. 389.Kitab al-Kubra an-Nisa(كتاب الكبرى النساء), p. 12.The Bible:Exodus 3:1–21 (Moses and God)1 Kings 19 (Elijah and God)Acts 18:9 (Paul and God)Sahih al-Bukhari: Collection of hadithsThe Holy Qur’an: Multiple translations and tafsirIbn Sa’d, Kitab al-Tabaqat al-Kabir: Early Islamic biographyW.

    "full_content": "Journal of Comparative Theology and Islamic StudiesVol. XX, No. X, 2025, pp. XX-XXClarity and Ambiguity in the Qur’an: Theological Tension and Interpretive InconsistencyDr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis article examines the internal tensions within the Qur’an concerning its self-proclaimed clarity and its simultaneous acknowledgement of ambiguity. Through a close reading of Qur’an 54:17 and Qur’an 3:7, and engagement with classical and contemporary exegesis, the study investigates the implications of these apparent inconsistencies for Islamic hermeneutics, theology, and religious epistemology. The article concludes that the Qur’anic text maintains a dynamic but unresolved tension between universality and mystery, which fundamentally shapes its interpretive tradition and its claims to religious authority.IntroductionThe Qur’an’s unique status as the central scripture of Islam hinges on its perceived clarity and role as a universal guide. However, a close reading of the Qur’an reveals a significant hermeneutical tension: the text repeatedly claims accessibility and ease of understanding (Qur’an 54:17), yet simultaneously attests to the presence of ambiguous verses whose meanings are known only to God (Qur’an 3:7). This article critically examines the nature and impact of this tension, arguing that the Qur’anic discourse on clarity and ambiguity is both a theological challenge and a driving force behind Islamic interpretive diversity.Qur’anic Self-Characterization: Clear or Ambiguous?Qur’an 54:17 states: “And We have certainly made the Qur’an easy to remember, so is there anyone who will be mindful?” This assertion, repeated several times throughout Surah al-Qamar (54:22, 32, 40), suggests that the Qur’an is both pedagogically accessible and intended for universal comprehension. The language of “ease” (yassarnā) and “remembrance” (dhikr) underscores a scriptural ideal: a text meant for internalization and practical application by all believers.Yet, the narrative shifts in Qur’an 3:7:“It is He Who has sent down to you the Book; in it are verses that are precise—they are the foundation of the Book—and others unspecific. As for those in whose hearts is deviation, they will follow that of it which is unspecific, seeking discord and seeking an interpretation [suitable to them]. And no one knows its [true] interpretation except Allah. But those firm in knowledge say, ‘We believe in it. All is from our Lord.’”Here, the Qur’an distinguishes between “muhkam” (clear and decisive) verses and “mutashābih” (ambiguous or allegorical) verses, introducing a paradigm wherein some scriptural content is intentionally left obscure. The implications are profound: whereas the former set of verses constitutes the “mother of the Book” (umm al-kitāb), the latter set is regarded as a potential source of fitna (discord) when pursued with ulterior motives.The Exegetical Tradition: Navigating AmbiguityClassical tafsir literature is replete with discussions concerning the nature of these ambiguous verses. Early exegetes such as Al-Tabari (d. 923) and Ibn Kathir (d. 1373) maintain that while the core theological and legal teachings of the Qur’an are manifest, certain metaphysical matters (e.g., descriptions of God, eschatological imagery) are deliberately veiled, serving as a test of faith and interpretive discipline (Tabari,Tafsir, on 3:7; Ibn Kathir,Tafsir al-Qur’an al-‘Azim). The Ash‘ari and Mu‘tazili schools offered distinct hermeneutical strategies—ranging from literal affirmation without modality (bi-la kayf) to extensive metaphorization—thereby engendering diversity, and at times, controversy within Islamic thought (Watt, 1973).Contemporary scholars, such as Fazlur Rahman (1980) and Abdullah Saeed (2006), contend that this dynamic reflects both the universalizing ambitions of the Qur’an and its preservation of divine mystery. Rahman asserts that the Qur’an’s message is, in principle, comprehensible to all, but that certain passages necessarily transcend human cognition due to their metaphysical subject matter. Saeed emphasizes that the category of mutashābih serves to both invite interpretive humility and safeguard doctrinal orthodoxy.Theological and Epistemological RamificationsThe juxtaposition of clarity and ambiguity within the Qur’an has generated significant debate concerning religious epistemology and authority. If the Qur’an is both clear and cryptic, to what extent can the individual believer be held accountable for their interpretation? Can theological pluralism be justified on the basis of scriptural ambiguity, or does this undermine claims to objective religious truth? Critics—both within and outside the Islamic tradition—have argued that this duality is sometimes invoked apologetically to avoid difficult questions or to neutralize interpretive dissent (Bucaille, 1976; Wansbrough, 1977).Furthermore, the ambiguity inherent in the Qur’anic text has contributed to the proliferation of divergent sectarian readings—most notably between Sunni, Shi‘a, and Sufi traditions—each laying claim to the “clear” message while accusing others of exploiting ambiguity for polemical ends (Ayoub, 1984).ConclusionThe Qur’an’s simultaneous assertion of clarity and admission of ambiguity is not merely a rhetorical device, but a constitutive feature of its textual and theological identity. This unresolved tension has inspired both a rich exegetical tradition and enduring controversy. Ultimately, the Qur’an presents itself as a text to be approached with both intellectual engagement and epistemic humility. Its claim to universality, juxtaposed with its admitted mystery, ensures that interpretation will remain a perennial endeavor within the Islamic tradition.ReferencesThe Qur’an (Translations: Yusuf Ali, Pickthall, Saheeh International)Al-Tabari,Jāmiʿ al-bayān fī taʾwīl āy al-QurʾānIbn Kathir,Tafsir al-Qur’an al-‘AzimFazlur Rahman,Major Themes of the Qur’an.

Tukio hili limejadiliwa na wanazuoni wa Kiislamu na wasio Waislamu kutokana na uzito na athari zake katika mafundisho kuhusu isma (kutokukosea kwa manabii) na dhana ya usafi wa ndani wa Mtume.Taarifa ya Kihistoria kuhusu Upasuaji wa Mtume MuhammadKwa mujibu wa masimulizi yaliyopokewa na Anas bin Malik na kuandikwa katika Sahih Muslim (Juzuu ya 1, uk. 147, hadithi namba 713), inasimuliwa kuwa Mtume Muhammad alipasuliwa mara nne tofauti:Mara ya kwanza, akiwa na umri wa miaka mitatu.Mara ya pili, akiwa na umri wa miaka kumi.Mara ya tatu, akiwa na umri wa miaka arobaini.Mara ya nne, alipokuwa anaandaliwa kwa tukio la Israa, akiwa na umri wa miaka arobaini na tatu.Katika simulizi hili, Anas bin Malik anaeleza:“Mtume wa Allah (s.a.w) alikuwa akicheza pamoja na watoto. Malaika Jibril (a.s) alimfikia, akamchukua na kumtupa chini, akapasua kifua chake, akauchukua moyo wake, akatoa ndani yake kipande cha damu na kusema: ‘Hii ni sehemu ya shetani (nimeitoa) kutoka kwako.’ Kisha akaosha moyo wake katika chombo cha dhahabu kilichokuwa na maji ya Zamzam, akaurudisha na kuufunga mahali pake.”Maswali ya Kitaaluma Yanayoibuka:Sehemu hii ya shetani iliingiaje kwenye moyo wa Muhammad?Tukio hili linaibua hoja kuhusu hali ya kiroho na usafi wa Mtume kabla ya upasuaji, jambo linaloweza kuathiri dhana ya utakatifu na ulinzi wa manabii katika Uislamu.Tangu lini shetani anasafishwa kwa maji?Dhima ya kutumia maji ya Zamzam kama njia ya kumsafisha shetani inatia shaka kimantiki na kimafundisho. Inapingana na imani za kidini kuhusu asili ya shetani kama roho na siyo uchafu wa mwili unaoweza kuoshwa.Ulinganisho na Hadithi kuhusu Yesu (Isa bin Mariam):Katika hadithi nyingine iliyosimuliwa na Abu Huraira, Mtume Muhammad alisema:“Kila mwanadamu anapozaliwa, shetani huingia katika mbavu zake kwa vidole vyake, isipokuwa Isa bin Mariam. Alijaribu kumwingia lakini akakuta pazia.”(Sahih Bukhari na Sahih Muslim)Hadithi hii inamtaja Yesu pekee kama asiyeweza kuguswa na shetani tangu kuzaliwa, akimpiku hata Muhammad katika hali ya utakatifu.HitimishoMasimulizi haya yanaleta changamoto kubwa katika teolojia ya Kiislamu kuhusu dhana ya utakatifu wa manabii na mbinu za kuondoa ushawishi wa shetani. Pia, yanaleta ulinganisho wa moja kwa moja kati ya Yesu na Muhammad, ambapo Yesu anaonekana kuwa na cheo cha kipekee katika usafi wa kiroho.Imeandikwa na: Max Shimba, mtumwa wa Yesu KristoKwa ajili ya Max Shimba Ministries OrgMAX SHIMBA MINISTRIES ORG ©2016.

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute | Max Shimba Ministries Org ©20161. Muhammad Attempted Suicide2. Muhammad Climbed Mountains to Throw Himself Off3. Aisha Testifies Muhammad Was BewitchedDear Reader,As we study the Holy Bible, we find that God appointed His prophets and messengers out of love and grace. However, when I examined Islamic scriptures and historical sources related to the prophet Muhammad, I encountered very disturbing reports, particularly concerning his mental state and supernatural experiences. I will now present Islamic sources directly so that Muslims cannot claim I am misrepresenting their texts.I. MUHAMMAD ATTEMPTED SUICIDE DUE TO SPIRITUAL DISTRESSAccording toSahih al-Bukhari, after the first revelatory experience, Muhammad was deeply disturbed and attempted to commit suicide due to the suspension of revelation (wahy). He climbed to the top of mountains intending to throw himself off:“The Prophet said: ‘Will they expel me?’ … Later, after Waraqa bin Nawfal passed away, the revelation stopped for a time, and Muhammad became so distressed that he would go to the top of mountain peaks to throw himself off. But each time he reached the summit, the Angel Jibril would appear and reassure him saying: ‘You are truly the Messenger of Allah.’ Then he would calm down and return home. But when the period of silence lengthened, he would repeat the attempt.”(Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 9, Book of Interpretation, Hadith 6982)Question: Where in the Torah, Psalms, or Gospel do we ever read of any biblical prophet attempting suicide as Muhammad did?II. MUHAMMAD’S SUICIDAL TENDENCIES RECURRED MULTIPLE TIMESThe narration reveals that these suicidal attempts occurred repeatedly whenever divine revelation ceased:“The Prophet became so sorrowful due to the cessation of revelation that he repeatedly climbed mountaintops to throw himself off. But whenever he reached the peak, Jibril would appear and say, ‘Indeed, you are the true Messenger of Allah,’ which would calm him down…”(Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 8, Book of Invocations, p. 234)This repeated behavior reflects profound emotional instability that is alarming, especially for someone considered a prophet of God.III. AISHA CLAIMS MUHAMMAD WAS BEWITCHEDEven more concerning is the testimony of Aisha, Muhammad’s favorite wife, who claimed he was under a magical spell:“Narrated Aisha: Allah’s Messenger was bewitched to the extent that he believed he had done things which he had not done. One day, he prayed to Allah, and then said: ‘O Aisha, do you know that Allah has answered me concerning what I asked Him?’”(Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 8, Book of Medicine, Hadith 6391)Aisha confirms that Muhammad was deluded, thinking he had sexual relations with his wives when he had not. This aligns with another narration:“The Prophet remained under the effect of that spell for several days, believing he had approached his wives though he had not.”(Al-Furqan 25)How is it possible that a prophet of Allah could be bewitched while the all-powerful Allah looked on and did nothing?IV. MUHAMMAD DECLARED HIMSELF INSANEAnother disturbing confession from Muhammad is found inKitab al-Tabaqat al-Kabirby Ibn Sa’d:“O Khadijah, I see lights and hear voices. I fear I am mad (possessed or insane).”(Kitab al-Tabaqat al-Kabir, translated by S. Moinul Haq, Vol. 1, p. 225)In some translations, he is quoted as saying: “I fear I am going mad.”Could this fear have been rooted in the traumatic experience of his first “revelation,” where he was seized and violently pressed by a being in the cave?V. MUHAMMAD’S FIRST ENCOUNTER: TRAUMA OR REVELATION?InThe Life of Prophet Muhammadby Sheikh Abdullah Saleh Al-Farsy (pp. 16–17), we read about Muhammad’s first encounter with what he later believed to be the angel Jibril:“One day, during the month of Ramadan (17th, on a Monday, in the 40½th year of his life), the Prophet saw a man standing before him. He said, ‘Read!’ The Prophet replied, ‘I do not know how to read.’ The man seized him, pressed him hard, and repeated: ‘Read!’ This happened three times before the man recited the verses of Surah al-Alaq (96), which Muhammad then memorized. Frightened, he returned home. Khadija thought he had a fever and covered him. After he calmed down, he told her everything. She went to her cousin Waraqa bin Nawfal, who confirmed that Muhammad had seen the same angel who appeared to Moses and Jesus.”This traumatic experience suggests not peaceful divine inspiration, but an oppressive and fearful encounter, inconsistent with biblical revelation.VI. ACCORDING TO ANOTHER SOURCE, MUHAMMAD WAS TEMPTED BY SATAN IN THE CAVEAccording toWives and Children of the Prophet, also by Sheikh Abdullah Saleh Al-Farsy (p. 12), it is suggested that Muhammad may have been subjected to satanic manipulation during his early experiences in the cave.BIBLICAL PERSPECTIVE ON SUICIDEAccording to the Bible, suicide is never a prophetic characteristic. The act of taking one’s own life is condemned as self-murder, a violation of God's sovereign authority over life and death.The Bible mentions four individuals who committed suicide:Saul–1 Samuel 31:4Ahithophel–2 Samuel 17:23Zimri–1 Kings 16:18Judas Iscariot–Matthew 27:5Each of these men was wicked or spiritually compromised. Suicide in Scripture is a grave sin, and those who die without salvation face eternal judgment (Revelation 21:8).CONCLUSIONNow, to all Muslims: Show me in the Torah, the Psalms, or the Gospels, any prophet who attempted to commit suicide like Muhammad, or was bewitched, or confessed madness. Such attributes are not characteristics of God’s prophets as revealed in the Bible.The invitation stands: Come toJesus Christ, who is theWay, the Truth, and the Life(John 14:6). No prophet, no angel, no vision compares to the living Son of God.May the Lord bless you.Dr. Maxwell ShimbaServant of Jesus ChristShimba Theological InstituteMax Shimba Ministries Org ©2016.

    "full_content": "Title:The Theological Inconsistencies in Muhammad’s Claim of Chaining a Demon: A Critical Examination of Sahih al-Bukhari 3423By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis scholarly investigation critically evaluates the hadith inSahih al-Bukhari 3423, in which Muhammad claims he captured a strong demon (ifrit) during prayer and nearly chained it to a pillar of the mosque for public viewing. Drawing from Quranic texts, Islamic hadith literature, and theological logic, this paper questions the plausibility and spiritual value of such an event. It examines the theological motivations behind the narration, the implications for Islamic doctrine on jinn, and whether such claims reflect authentic spiritual authority or imaginative narratives.IntroductionInSahih al-Bukhari 3423, Muhammad is quoted as claiming he overpowered an ifrit (a powerful rebellious jinn) during his prayer, with the intent to tie it to a mosque pillar so others might witness it. He later states he released it out of deference to the prayer of Solomon inQur’an 38:35. This episode raises numerous theological concerns regarding the nature of jinn, the purpose of such an encounter, and whether such experiences serve divine purposes or promote mythologized self-glorification.1.The Claim of Binding a Demon: A Theological AnalysisMuhammad’s claim that he was able to physically subdue and bind a jinn (demon) contradicts both Islamic and biblical precedent concerning spiritual hierarchies and the unseen realm. InQur’an 38:35, Solomon asks Allah for a kingdom “not befitting anyone after me,” which included dominion over jinn. Muhammad, by invoking this verse, inadvertently places himself in tension with Solomon’s exclusive request.If Solomon's authority over jinn was a unique divine endowment, then Muhammad’s ability to overpower and display a demon would violate that exclusivity, undermining the Quran’s assertion of Solomon’s unparalleled kingship. Therefore, Muhammad’s release of the demon not out of mercy or spiritual discernment but seemingly to preserve the uniqueness of Solomon’s prayer appears forced and theologically inconsistent.Moreover, the idea of chaining a spiritual being so it becomes visible to physical eyes contradicts the Islamic doctrine that jinn areghayb(unseen), as confirmed inQur’an 7:27:“Indeed, he (Satan) sees you, he and his tribe, from where you do not see them.”This raises the logical problem: if jinn are by nature invisible to human perception, then binding one to a pillar for public viewing suggests either a miraculous materialization (which Muhammad does not claim), or fabrication.2.Spiritual Gain: What Would Seeing a Demon Accomplish?The supposed public display of a chained demon in the mosque lacks theological or redemptive purpose. In both Judeo-Christian and Islamic traditions, signs and wonders are meant to inspire faith, repentance, or divine awe. Displaying a demon, a cursed entity, in a place of worship neither glorifies God nor edifies believers.Furthermore, Islam’s teachings abouttazkiyah(spiritual purification) and humility in worship contradict the sensationalism of exhibiting a captured demon. There is no precedent in the Quran or hadith where spiritual maturity is gained by physically seeing evil spirits. Rather, the focus is on resisting evil through prayer, fasting, and the remembrance of Allah.Hence, the question remains: what divine purpose would have been served by a mosque audience witnessing a chained ifrit? The answer appears to be none. The story seems more mythopoeic, bolstering Muhammad’s image as spiritually powerful rather than conveying a redemptive truth.3.Why Did Muhammad Encounter a Demon?According to the hadith, the demon came to “cut off” Muhammad’s prayer. However, this claim raises questions: if Muhammad was the most perfect of creation (al-insan al-kamil), and the one protected by Allah (ma’sum), why would Allah allow a jinn to attack him during such a holy act?The Quran teaches that the righteous are under divine protection:“Indeed, My servants – no authority will you have over them, except those who follow you of the deviators.”(Qur’an 15:42)So either Muhammad was vulnerable to demonic interruption in prayer (contradicting divine protection), or the story is a fabricated spiritual legend intended to magnify Muhammad's supposed power over the unseen realm.4.Do Demons Attend Mosque Prayers?According to several Islamic traditions, jinn—including disbelieving ones—can infiltrate human spaces, including mosques.Sahih Muslim 540suggests that yawning in prayer is caused by Shaytan, and he \"laughs\" when one yawns. But the Quran consistently portrays mosques as places purified for Allah’s worship (Qur’an 72:18):“And the mosques are for Allah, so do not invoke anyone along with Allah.”If demons can attack prophets in a mosque, during prayer, then the theological premise that mosques are sacred, protected spaces is undermined.5.Are Demons from the Jinn?Islamic theology considers demons a subset of jinn. The Quran mentions that Iblis (Satan) was one of the jinn (Qur’an 18:50):“He was one of the jinn, and he rebelled against the command of his Lord.”Hence, “demon” and “jinn” in this context are nearly interchangeable, particularly when describing rebellious and harmful entities.6.Are Jinn Not Muslims? Contradictions in Islamic LiteratureThe Quran presents jinn as morally responsible beings capable of both faith and disbelief:“And among us are the righteous, and among us are [others] not so; we were [of] divided ways.”(Qur’an 72:11)“Say, it has been revealed to me that a group of the jinn listened and said, ‘Indeed, we have heard an amazing Quran.’”(Qur’an 72:1)Yet this creates internal theological tensions. If some jinn are Muslims, then depicting all jinn (or all ifrit) as inherently demonic is misleading. Moreover, the portrayal of an ifrit being bound like a circus animal for display contradicts the notion of jinn as free-willed and spiritually responsible agents.Conclusion:Muhammad’s claim of capturing a demon during prayer and nearly displaying it to his followers in the mosque is fraught with theological and logical inconsistencies. It undermines Islamic teachings on the uniqueness of Solomon’s dominion, the nature of the unseen realm, the sanctity of mosques, and the spiritual integrity of divine encounters. The story, rather than elevating Muhammad’s prophetic character, instead aligns more with myth-making—a self-aggrandizing narrative designed to bolster his spiritual prestige without offering any genuine theological or redemptive benefit to his followers.The inconsistency in the claim affirms that such narration is better understood as a fabrication, myth, or legend rather than an authentic act of divine authority.Dr. Maxwell ShimbaFounder, Shimba Theological Institute",

    "full_content": "The Enigma of the Messengers in Quran 36:14: A Critical Analysis of Divine Knowledge and Narrative ClarityBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractQuran 36:14 describes a divine episode in which Allah claims to have sent two, and subsequently a third, messenger to a certain city. Yet, the Quran offers no explicit identification of these individuals or the city in question, despite asserting its own clarity and completeness. This article critically examines the ambiguity of this narrative, interrogates the implications for the purported omniscience and communicative transparency of Allah, and contrasts this episode with the narrative standards of Biblical and historical prophetic literature. The analysis ultimately challenges the Quranic claim to clarity (Quran 12:1, 16:89, 41:3) and highlights significant epistemic and hermeneutical deficiencies.IntroductionAmong the central claims of the Quran is its position as a \"clear book\" (kitābun mubīn, Quran 12:1), a revelation in \"clear Arabic\" intended to be a comprehensive guide to mankind (Quran 16:89). Yet, a close reading of many Quranic passages reveals notable narrative ambiguities and omissions, most starkly illustrated in the account of the messengers sent to a city in Surah Ya-Sin (Quran 36:13–14). This article investigates the lacunae in this account, particularly the lack of explicit identification of the prophets and the city, and examines the implications for the Quran’s claim to clarity and divine omniscience.The Textual Problem: Quran 36:13–14The passage in question reads:\"And set out to them a parable: the dwellers of the city, when there came messengers to them. When We sent to them two, but they denied them both, so We strengthened them with a third. They said, 'Indeed, we are sent to you.'\"(Quran 36:13–14)Crucially, the Quran does not provide:The names of the messengers.The name of the city.The historical context or time period.This absence is remarkable given the Quran’s self-assertion astibyān li-kulli shayʾ(\"an explanation of all things,\" Quran 16:89).Traditional Exegesis: Attempts to Fill the GapsMuslim exegetes (mufassirūn) have long grappled with this vagueness. The majority, including classical authorities such as Ibn Kathir, Al-Tabari, and Al-Qurtubi, relay speculative traditions (Isra’iliyyat), often borrowing from Christian sources. Some suggest the city is Antioch, and the messengers are disciples of Jesus (Barnabas, Paul, Peter, John, etc.). However, the Quran itself is silent on these specifics, and these interpretations are neither unanimous nor rooted in Quranic text.The reliance on external, sometimes apocryphal, traditions raises methodological concerns:Why must the “clear book” rely on non-Quranic sources for clarification?Does this not betray a deficiency in the primary text?Comparative Analysis: Biblical and Prophetic NarrativesIn sharp contrast, the Biblical narrative—whether Old or New Testament—typically provides detailed accounts of prophets:Names (e.g., Moses, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Jesus).Geographic locations (Egypt, Israel, Nineveh, etc.).Chronological and social contexts.Such precision serves both historical and theological purposes, allowing for meaningful engagement and verifiability. The Quranic narrative in 36:14, by contrast, lacks these basic attributes of historical clarity.The Problem of Omniscience and ClarityIf Allah is omniscient and wishes to communicate guidance “clearly,” the omission of essential details is problematic:Epistemic Ambiguity:The absence of names and location renders the passage unanchored, open to endless speculation, and ultimately functionally ambiguous.Hermeneutical Uncertainty:The requirement for extraneous tradition to fill gaps undermines the sufficiency of revelation. As Rippin (2001) observes, “the act of interpretation in Islam is often an act of supplementing rather than explaining.”Theological Implications:If divine knowledge is perfect, why does revelation obscure rather than elucidate? If clarity is the standard, why this narrative reticence?Quranic Self-ContradictionThe Quran asserts,“This is a clear Book” (Quran 12:1),“We have not neglected in the Book a thing” (Quran 6:38),“We have explained in detail every kind of example for mankind” (Quran 17:89).Yet, in 36:14, it demonstrably neglects what would be considered essential narrative elements.Discussion: The Weakness of the Claim to ClarityThe Quran’s persistent vagueness in passages such as 36:14 raises serious challenges to the claim of its communicative clarity and, by extension, the scope and reliability of Allah’s knowledge as expressed in the text. The divine message, so vital for guidance, is instead presented as an enigmatic parable whose specifics are irretrievable without extra-Quranic interpolation.Scholarly CritiqueMichael Cook(The Koran: A Very Short Introduction, 2000) notes the Quran’s “tendency to allude rather than narrate,” which renders much of its content inaccessible without prior knowledge or external sources.Gabriel Said Reynolds(The Qur’an and Its Biblical Subtext, 2010) identifies this as a deliberate, if problematic, literary technique, one that often frustrates genuine understanding.ConclusionQuran 36:14 serves as a paradigmatic example of the epistemological and communicative weakness inherent in the Quranic revelation. By failing to identify the very individuals and city at the heart of the story, the Quran undermines its claim to clarity and completeness. This exposes an internal contradiction and questions the efficacy of divine knowledge as transmitted in the Islamic scripture.Unless one is prepared to accept that the divine message is intentionally obscurantist, the logical inference is that Allah’s knowledge—at least as rendered in the Quran—is insufficiently clear, leaving the purportedly guided audience in ambiguity rather than certainty.ReferencesThe Quran (36:13–14, 12:1, 16:89, 41:3, 6:38, 17:89)Al-Tabari,Tafsir al-TabariIbn Kathir,Tafsir al-Quran al-AzimMichael Cook,The Koran: A Very Short Introduction(Oxford, 2000)Gabriel Said Reynolds,The Qur’an and Its Biblical Subtext(Routledge, 2010)Andrew Rippin,The Blackwell Companion to the Qur’an(Blackwell, 2001)The Bible (various references)Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThe divinity of Jesus Christ is one of the central doctrines of historic Christianity and a frequent point of contention in Christian-Muslim dialogue. This article explores, from a scholarly perspective, the biblical evidence for Jesus' explicit and implicit claims to be God, considering key texts from both the Gospels and the broader New Testament. The analysis further addresses common misunderstandings and responds to critical objections raised by alternative religious perspectives, especially within Islamic theology.IntroductionThe question of whether Jesus of Nazareth explicitly claimed divinity is not only a matter of theological import but also of historical and exegetical significance. While some critics argue that Jesus never identified Himself as God, a closer examination of the biblical texts reveals a robust tapestry of self-identification that is consistent with divine status. This article evaluates the primary texts where Jesus either directly or indirectly claimed to be God and examines their implications for Christian doctrine.1.Direct Claims of Divinitya) The “I Am” SayingsPerhaps the most profound claim comes from Jesus’ use of the phrase “I am” (Greek: ἐγώ εἰμι,ego eimi)—a direct allusion to the divine name revealed to Moses in Exodus 3:14 (“I AM WHO I AM”). In John 8:58, Jesus declares, “Before Abraham was, I am.” This utterance, which echoes the Septuagint rendering of the divine name, prompted the Jews to attempt to stone Him for blasphemy, recognizing His claim to deity (John 8:59).b) Revelation: The Alpha and OmegaThe book of Revelation records Jesus as saying, “I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End” (Rev 22:13). These titles are used in the Old Testament for Yahweh alone (cf. Isaiah 44:6), demonstrating that the risen Christ ascribes to Himself attributes of eternality and sovereignty unique to God. Furthermore, in Revelation 1:8, Jesus says, “I am the Almighty,” a term that in the Greek (παντοκράτωρ,pantokrator) denotes absolute omnipotence.2.Jesus’ Functional Equality with Goda) Authority Over Life and JudgmentJesus claims to be the source of life and the final judge. In John 11:25, He says, “I am the resurrection and the life.” In John 5:22-23, He asserts that the Father “has entrusted all judgment to the Son, that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father.” Such statements equate Jesus’ prerogatives with those belonging to God alone (cf. Deut 32:39; 1 Sam 2:6).b) The Giver of Eternal LifeIn John 10:28, Jesus says, “I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish.” The power to grant eternal life is repeatedly ascribed to God in the Old Testament (cf. Psalm 36:9). Jesus’ self-ascription here again demonstrates His divine prerogative.3.Identification with God’s Unique Titles and Functionsa) “The Truth, the Life, the Light”In John 14:6, Jesus affirms, “I am the way, the truth, and the life.” In John 8:12, He states, “I am the light of the world.” The Old Testament depicts Yahweh as the source of light (Psalm 27:1), life (Deut 30:20), and truth (Isaiah 65:16).b) Worship and Prayer Directed to JesusThe Gospels and the wider New Testament record Jesus receiving worship (Matthew 14:33; 28:9, 17; John 20:28) and prayers (Acts 7:59-60; 1 Corinthians 1:2)—honor reserved for God alone (Exodus 34:14; Isaiah 42:8).4.Jesus as “The Son of Man” and Daniel 7:13–14In Daniel 7:13–14, the “Son of Man” receives worship and an eternal kingdom—roles ascribed to God alone. Jesus appropriates this title for Himself throughout the Synoptic Gospels, and before the Sanhedrin affirms that He is the eschatological Son of Man who will come “on the clouds of heaven” (Mark 14:61-64), leading to His condemnation for blasphemy.5.Response to Islamic ObjectionsMuslim apologists frequently argue that Jesus never said “I am God, worship Me” in those exact words. However, the biblical pattern is one of indirect and culturally appropriate self-revelation, mirroring the theophanic communications of God in the Old Testament. Furthermore, Jesus’ self-identification, authority, and reception of worship are tantamount to clear claims to deity within the context of Second Temple Judaism.ConclusionThe cumulative weight of the biblical evidence affirms that Jesus did not merely claim to be a prophet or a moral teacher but uniquely identified Himself with the God of Israel. The explicit and implicit claims to divine status, the ascription of divine prerogatives, the acceptance of worship, and the fulfillment of Old Testament theophanic imagery all substantiate the historic Christian confession:Jesus is God manifest in the flesh(John 1:1, 14; 1 Timothy 3:16). Any denial of this reality fails to account for the full witness of the New Testament documents and the earliest Christian testimony.ReferencesBauckham, R. (2008).Jesus and the God of Israel.

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionOne of the most frequently asked questions by Islamic scholars and adherents is:How can Jesus be the Son of God?How can God have a Son without a wife?These questions arise from misunderstandings about the Christian doctrine of the Sonship of Jesus. In this exposition, we shall clarify the true theological meaning of \"Son of God\" as applied to Jesus Christ, referencing the Christian Scriptures and contrasting the misunderstandings often presented in Islamic polemics.1. How is Jesus the Son of God?To begin, it must be categorically stated that Jesus Christ is not the \"Son of God\" in the ordinary, biological sense, as would be understood in human parenthood. This doesnotmean that God married and had a male child. Christians categorically reject any suggestion that God had sexual relations with Mary, resulting in the birth of Jesus—a notion sometimes implied in Islamic critiques. Rather, the title \"Son of God\" expresses a unique, spiritual, and eternal relationship between Jesus and God the Father, rooted in divine revelation and not in physical generation.John 1:1, 14states:\"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God... The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us.\"Here, \"the Word\" (Logos) refers to Jesus, who existed eternally with God and became incarnate.2. How Can God Have a Son Without a Wife?This question misunderstands the Christian teaching. The New Testament affirms that Jesus is the Son of God not by physical procreation, but by divine action through the Holy Spirit. The angelic announcement to Mary inLuke 1:35is explicit:\"The angel answered, 'The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. Therefore the holy one to be born will be called the Son of God.'\" (NIV)Mary did not conceive Jesus through any natural human process but by the supernatural intervention of the Holy Spirit, who is fully God. Thus, Jesus is called \"holy\" and \"the Son of God\" by the angel, a unique title denoting both his divine origin and his unique relationship to God the Father.3. Jesus Affirms His Identity as the Son of GodDuring his trial before the Jewish religious leaders, the high priest directly challenged Jesus:\"The high priest said to him, 'I charge you under oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.' 'Yes, it is as you say,' Jesus replied. 'But I say to all of you: In the future you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.'\"(Matthew 26:63-64, NIV)Jesus didnotdeny being the Son of God. On the contrary, he affirmed it, even invokingDaniel 7:13-14regarding the Son of Man's divine authority—provoking a charge of blasphemy from the Jewish leaders.4. The Jewish Understanding of \"Son of God\"Later, before the Roman governor Pilate, the Jewish leaders insisted:\"The Jews insisted, 'We have a law, and according to that law he must die, because he claimed to be the Son of God.'\"(John 19:7, NIV)For the Jews, Jesus’ claim to be the \"Son of God\" was not understood as a metaphor or a mere honorific title. It signified equality with God—an assertion of divinity. This is further emphasized inJohn 5:18:\"For this reason the Jews tried all the harder to kill him; not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God.\"Thus, to claim to be the Son of God, in this context, meant to claim a unique, divine status—hence the charge of blasphemy and the demand for Jesus’ execution.5. The Theological Meaning of \"Son of God\"The New Testament further clarifies the meaning of \"Son of God.\"Hebrews 1:3describes Jesus as:\"The radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful word. After he had provided purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty in heaven.\"This passage highlights both the divinity and the preexistence of Jesus as the Son of God, affirming his unique relationship and essential unity with the Father.To understand the term \"Son of God\" in the biblical sense is to recognize that Jesus is the perfect, visible manifestation of the invisible God (Colossians 1:15;John 14:9). The title does not imply literal offspring, but rather a relationship of shared essence, authority, and mission.6. Analogy: \"Son of Perdition\" and Biblical IdiomsA further clarification can be found in biblical idioms. InJohn 17:12, Judas Iscariot is referred to as \"the son of perdition\" (or \"son of destruction\"). This does not mean Judas was literally born from \"destruction\" as a parent, but rather that his life and actions embodied destruction. Similarly, to be \"the Son of God\" is to embody the character and essence of God.7. Jesus as God Revealed in FleshUltimately, the doctrine of the Sonship of Jesus is inseparable from the doctrine of the Incarnation: God revealed in human flesh.John 1:1, 14again affirms: \"The Word was God... and the Word became flesh.\" This mystery is foundational to Christian faith.ConclusionThe question \"How can Jesus be the Son of God?\" is resolved by understanding that the Christian claim is not of biological paternity, but of an eternal, spiritual relationship—God manifesting Himself in the person of Jesus Christ, uniquely begotten, not made, of one essence with the Father (Nicene Creed). This truth is attested by Scripture, proclaimed by Jesus Himself, and understood by his followers as the foundation of Christian faith.ReferencesThe Holy Bible, New International Version (NIV)John 1:1, 14; John 5:18; John 17:12; John 19:7Luke 1:35Matthew 26:63-66Daniel 7:13-14Hebrews 1:3Colossians 1:15The Nicene CreedBibliographyCarson, D.

This article examines points of perceived similarity between non-theism (often associated with atheism and secular humanism) and Islam (as represented in classical Islamic doctrine and selected interpretations). The intent is to foster rigorous academic dialogue, rather than to incite polemic, by carefully interrogating claims and providing a balanced perspective informed by both religious texts and scholarly analysis.Exhibit 1: Denial of the Existence of GodClaim:Both non-theists and Muslims deny the existence of the true God.IslamIslam asserts strict monotheism (tawhid), expressed in the Shahada: “There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah” (Qur’an 3:18). However, from a Christian theological perspective, the Islamic concept of God (Allah) is considered distinct from the biblical Triune God (cf. Deuteronomy 6:4; Matthew 28:19).Reference:The Qur’an 3:18, 112:1–4Partridge, C. (2013).Introduction to World Religions. Fortress Press.Non-theismNon-theism, particularly in its atheistic form, explicitly denies the existence of any deity (cf. Dawkins,The God Delusion, 2006).Reference:Dawkins, R. (2006).The God Delusion. Bantam.Scholarly Note:While Islam affirms the existence of Allah, non-theism categorically denies any deity. The claim of “denying the existence of God” requires clarification: Islam rejects the Christian concept of God but is not atheistic. Theological debates hinge on definitions of \"God\" (cf. Plantinga,God and Other Minds, 1967).Exhibit 2: Beliefs About EvolutionClaim:Both non-theists and Muslims support a form of evolution linking humans to primates.IslamSome interpretations of the Qur’an reference transformations as divine punishments, e.g., “those who transgressed were turned into apes and pigs” (Qur’an 2:65, 5:60, 7:166). Classical exegesis treats these as miraculous punishments, not evolutionary claims.Reference:The Qur’an 2:65, 5:60, 7:166Ibn Kathir,Tafsir al-Qur’an al-Azim.Non-theismModern non-theism often accepts Darwinian evolution, which posits humans and primates share common ancestry (cf. Darwin,On the Origin of Species, 1859).Reference:Darwin, C. (1859).On the Origin of Species. John Murray.Scholarly Note:The “transformation” in Islamic scripture is a supernatural event, distinct from scientific evolution. Non-theism grounds its belief in materialistic evolution, while traditional Islam neither affirms nor denies Darwinism as doctrine.Exhibit 3: Racial Attitudes Toward Black AfricansClaim:Both non-theists and Muslims harbor negative attitudes toward Black Africans.IslamSome controversial hadiths attribute pejorative descriptions to Black Africans (see al-Tabari,Historyvol. 1), but many Islamic scholars contest the authenticity or interpretation of such traditions. The Qur’an states, “O mankind! We created you from a single (pair) … and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know each other. Verily the most honored of you in the sight of Allah is he who is the most righteous” (Qur’an 49:13).Reference:The Qur’an 49:13Lewis, B. (1990).Race and Slavery in the Middle East. Oxford University Press.Non-theismHistorical non-theists, such as certain proponents of Social Darwinism, have at times propagated racist ideologies (cf. Spencer,The Principles of Biology, 1864). However, contemporary non-theism (e.g., secular humanism) formally rejects racism.Reference:Spencer, H. (1864).The Principles of BiologyShermer, M. (2006).Why Darwin Matters. Holt.Scholarly Note:Sweeping generalizations risk misrepresentation. Both traditions contain diverse perspectives, and modern adherents often repudiate historical prejudices.Exhibit 4: Attitudes Toward ChristiansClaim:Both non-theists and Muslims are hostile to Christianity.IslamSome Qur’anic verses warn against intimate alliances with non-Muslims (Qur’an 5:51). Other verses uphold peaceful coexistence and tolerance (Qur’an 2:256). Historical and political contexts greatly influence interpretation.Reference:The Qur’an 5:51, 2:256Firestone, R. (1999).Jihad: The Origin of Holy War in Islam. Oxford.Non-theismAtheist regimes (e.g., Soviet Union) at times persecuted Christians, but non-theism as a philosophical stance varies widely regarding religion.Reference:Froese, P. (2008).The Plot to Kill God. University of California Press.Scholarly Note:Attributing hostility to entire worldviews requires careful qualification. Religious persecution has complex political, historical, and social causes.Exhibit 5: Authority of Dead Prophets/FoundersClaim:Both non-theists and Muslims revere the teachings of deceased leaders.IslamMuslims regard Muhammad as the final prophet, but not as divine; their ultimate authority is the Qur’an, believed to be God’s revelation (Qur’an 33:40).Reference:The Qur’an 33:40Watt, W.M. (1953).Muhammad at Medina. Oxford.Non-theismNon-theists may draw inspiration from figures such as Charles Darwin, but do not attribute prophetic status or authority akin to religious veneration.Reference:Ruse, M. (2006).Darwinism and Its Discontents. Cambridge.Scholarly Note:The analogy between prophetic authority and scientific influence is tenuous; religious authority is rooted in revelation, while scientific legacy is subject to revision.ConclusionWhile the article identifies select parallels between non-theism and Islam, rigorous academic and theological analysis demonstrates substantial differences in foundational beliefs, historical contexts, and internal diversity. Scholarship urges caution against broad generalizations, emphasizing critical inquiry and contextual understanding.ReferencesThe Qur’an (various translations).Dawkins, R. (2006).The God Delusion.

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba | Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionIn recent decades, questions surrounding Islam’s attitude toward Black Africans have become increasingly relevant, particularly as some Islamic proponents seek to recruit African Americans by claiming that Islam is a “Black religion,” that its origins are African, or even that Muhammad himself was Black. This narrative is carefully constructed to appeal to Black audiences, while a different approach is used for non-Black groups. As such, it is crucial to scrutinize these claims, not through the lens of race or origin, but on the merits and actual teachings of Islam itself. This article draws primarily from Islamic sacred texts—the Qur’an and Hadith (specifically,Sahih al-BukhariandSahih Muslim)—to objectively evaluate Islam’s historical and scriptural relationship with Black Africans.1. Africa Was Not the Cradle of IslamIslam originated in the7th century CEon the Arabian Peninsula, a region geographically situated in Asia, separated from Africa by the Red Sea. The claim that Islam is inherently African is historically inaccurate. The spread of Islam into Africa occurred after its birth in Arabia, and while Islam has a significant presence in Africa today, it did not originate there.By contrast, Christianity’s presence in Africa dates back to thefirst century. Saint Mark, the author of the Gospel of Mark, was a North African Jew who preached Christianity in Egypt. From there, Christianity spread throughout North and sub-Saharan Africa. The early church recognized Black saints, such asSaint Moses the BlackandSaint Tekla Haimanot(Ethiopia). Notably, one of the early church prophets and teachers was “Simeon Niger” (Acts 13:1), where “Niger” is Latin for “Black.” The first recorded African Christian was the Ethiopian official baptized by Philip (Acts 8:26–40).2. Muhammad Was Not BlackMuhammad was an Arab from the Quraysh tribe, ethnically and phenotypically distinct from Black Africans. Multiple Islamic sources describe Muhammad as having a fair or white complexion:Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 1, Hadith 63:“While we were sitting with the Prophet, a man came and asked, ‘Who among you is Muhammad?’ We replied, ‘This white man reclining on his arm…’”Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 2, Hadith 122:Refers to Muhammad as a “white man.”Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 2, Hadith 141:“The whiteness of his armpits became visible when he raised his arms.”It is therefore a historical and textual error to portray Muhammad as a Black African.3. Muhammad and the Issue of Black SlavesMuhammad owned Black slaves. Notable among them were Bilal, Abu Huraira, Usama ibn Zayd, and a young slave named Rabbah. Even today, in Saudi Arabia—the birthplace of Islam—the common word for “Black person” is“Abd”, meaning “slave.” This reflects a deeply ingrained social hierarchy based on race.Example from Hadith:On one occasion, a man freed a female slave who was his concubine. Upon hearing this, Muhammad auctioned the boy she bore, selling him for 800 dirhams (Sahih Muslim, Vol. 7, p. 83).The penalty for adultery varied based on status:A free man received 100 lashes and exile; a free woman was stoned to death; a slave woman received 100 lashes, but neither exile nor execution, because she was property and could be resold if she repeated the offense (Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 8:821, 822).4. Islam’s Disparaging Attitude Toward BlacksIslamic scriptures contain language and references that are derogatory toward Black people.Muhammad referred to Black people as “raisins-heads” (Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 1, No. 662; Vol. 9, No. 256).In another authentic hadith, Muhammad is quoted as saying,“Black people steal when they are hungry, and when they are full, they commit adultery”(Sahih Muslim).Muhammad reportedly said,“You must obey your leader even if he is an Ethiopian slave with a flat nose”—a reference that reinforces both racial and class prejudice (Sahih Muslim, Vol. 9, pp. 46–47).5. Islam and the Question of Freedom and EqualityEven if one were to erroneously claim that Islam began in Africa or that Muhammad was Black, these would not justify embracing Islam, particularly given its stance on human rights and freedom.Islamic law and scripture do not champion religious freedom.The Qur’an states:“If anyone desires a religion other than Islam, never will it be accepted of him; and in the Hereafter he will be among the losers.”(Qur’an 3:85)Islamic teachings include:Men are superior to women:Qur’an 2:228Women’s rights are half those of men:In testimony: Qur’an 2:282In inheritance: Qur’an 4:11A man may beat his wife:Qur’an 4:34A man may marry up to four wives:Qur’an 4:3Muslims must fight until all opponents submit:Qur’an 9:5A Muslim may not befriend Jews or Christians:Qur’an 5:54Apostates must be killed:Qur’an 9:12Theft punished by hand amputation:Qur’an 5:41Adultery punished by flogging in public:Qur’an 24:2No separation between religion and state:Qur’an 2:193No dissent tolerated:Qur’an 4:59These positions are in direct conflict with the ideals of civil and human rights.6. Islam’s Contemporary Treatment of Black AfricansClaims that Islam cares about Black people are contradicted by ongoing abuses. For instance, Black Muslim communities in Sudan have been enslaved, persecuted, and massacred by Arab Muslims. Reports by the U.S. State Department have documented cases where Black Christians were captured and sold as slaves (U.S. State Dept., May 26, 1993).7. The Christian AlternativeIn contrast, Jesus Christ offers eternal life and true equality:“There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.”(Galatians 3:28)“You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”(John 8:32)“Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery.”(Galatians 5:1–2)Christian teaching makes no racial, gender, or social distinctions before God.ConclusionThe claims that Islam is a religion for Black people, or that it is African in origin, are both unfounded and manipulative. True religious commitment must be based on the content of faith, not race or geography.Know the truth. Follow the truth.

    "full_content": "INTRODUCTIONFor more than twenty years now, it has become common to hear in lectures conducted by Islamic scholars, which have spread in various parts of the world, especially in East and Central African countries. These scholars teach communities through the Quran and the Bible by saying that there is only one God. They say that God in Hebrew is called Jehovah, in Arabic Allah, in English God, and in Swahili Mungu. Therefore, they claim that the God Allah as taught in the Quran is the same as Jehovah as taught in the Bible. These lectures conducted by Muslims have become widespread, for example, in Tanzania there are many groups, one of which is called Al-Marid International Propagation Center. They have written on their banner quoting from the Bible, words written by the Apostle Paul in Ephesians 4:4-6. The words they quoted say, \"There is one Lord, one faith... one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.\" When I visited Morogoro town, at the airport area, I saw a mosque with these words from Ephesians 4:4-6 written on it. When I visited Nairobi in Kenya, I also saw many groups conducting lectures, and one of them is called Kibera Islamic Propagation Centre. They have written a message on their banner saying, \"Let the Bible speak for itself,\" quoting this verse from the Gospel of John 8:32, \"And you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.\"Thus, you will see that these Islamic scholars teach the community using the Quran and the Bible, saying that Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala is Jehovah. They spread this teaching through Radio, Pamphlets, Lectures, books, and Video and Audio tapes. This has caused some Christians to leave their faith and convert to Islam. Some other Christians, although they have not changed their religion, believe this. The important question for every Christian to ask is, is it true that the God Allah as narrated in the Quran is the same as Jehovah as taught in the Bible? I urge you to follow this lesson carefully to know the truth...MAIN PARTS OF THIS LESSON ARE AS FOLLOWS...The arguments of Muslims saying Allah is Jehovah.Is the name of God according to the Quran and the Bible the same?Is the chief angel of Allah the same as Jehovah's?Who is the creator, Allah or Jehovah?The city chosen by Allah, is it the same as Jehovah's?How does Allah teach about purifying the soul, is it the same as Jehovah?Is Jehovah's heaven the same as Allah's?What is the end of those who worship Allah?1. The Arguments of Muslims Saying Allah is JehovahIslamic scholars say that the God Allah is Jehovah because the prophets of God according to the Bible and the Quran taught by saying that there is only one God. And they read these verses...What Prophet Moses said:Deuteronomy 6:4\"Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one.\"What Prophet Isaiah said:Isaiah 45:18,21\"For thus says the LORD, who created the heavens (He is God!), who formed the earth and made it... I am the LORD, and there is no other. A righteous God and a Savior; there is none besides Me.\"What Prophet David said:Psalms 86:10\"For You are great and do wondrous things; You alone are God.\"What Jesus said:John 17:3\"And this is eternal life, that they know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent.\"What Paul said:1 Corinthians 8:4\"Therefore, as to the eating of food offered to idols, we know that an idol has no real existence, and that there is no God but one.\"Here, Islamic scholars say that all prophets according to the Bible teach that there is only one God. What did Muhammad (s.a.w.) teach about God? They read these verses from the Quran...Quran 41:6 Surah Ha-Mim Sajdah (The Prostration)\"Say, 'I am only a man like you, to whom has been revealed that your God is one God...’\"Here, the scholars say that just as all prophets taught about one God, so did Muhammad.Quran 29:46-47 Surah Al-Ankabut (The Spider)\"And do not argue with the People of the Scripture except in a way that is best, except for those who commit injustice among them, and say, 'We believe in that which has been revealed to us and revealed to you. And our God and your God is one; and we are Muslims [in submission] to Him.' And thus We have sent down to you the Book. And those to whom We [previously] gave the Scripture believe in it. And among these [people of Makkah] are those who believe in it. And none reject Our verses except the disbelievers.\"Here, Islamic scholars say that the books of the Torah and the Gospel do not contradict the Quran, and these books were given to the Jews and Christians, and the God of Muslims and Christians is one.Is this argument true? I will answer this later.Responses about One GodIf you quickly look at how these Islamic scholars compare the verses of the Quran and the Bible, you might be convinced to believe what they teach, but it is good to study in depth according to the Quran and the Bible and then see if there is any truth in their teachings that Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala is Jehovah. Remember, the God we worship warned us Christians by saying...Exodus 20:1-3\"And God spoke all these words, saying, 'I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. You shall have no other gods before Me.'\"This warning from our God about having no other gods implies that there are other gods worshipped by people. Because in the Bible the word \"God\" in Hebrew \"Elohim\" and in Greek \"Theos\" is mentioned 3979 times, but false gods are mentioned 271 times. Some of these false gods are:Dagon (Judges 16:23)Baal (1 Kings 18:21)Artemis of the Ephesians (Acts 19:24-28)Additionally, when we read the Quran, it also mentions various gods that were worshipped in Mecca, such as:Quran 53:19-20,23 Surah An-Najm (The Star)\"19. So have you considered al-Lat and al-'Uzza? 20. And Manat, the third - the other one? 23. They are not but [mere] names you have named them - you and your forefathers - for which Allah has sent down no authority. They follow not except assumption and what their souls desire, and there has already come to them from their Lord guidance.\"Therefore, we see that there are many gods that are worshipped, and everyone who worships relies on that god and says there is one. For example, those who worshipped Dagon said he was one god, those who worshipped Baal said he was one god, those who worshipped Artemis said she was the great goddess. Likewise, the prophets served one God named Jehovah, and Muhammad worshipped one god named Allah. What I want to teach the community to know is whether Allah is Jehovah.2. Is the Name of God According to the Quran and the Bible the Same?One fundamental thing that identifies anything or anyone, be it a person, animal, or anything, is a name. Therefore, to know if the God worshipped by Muslims is the same as the one we Christians worship, we must look at the name. Is it the same?Quran 17:110 Surah Bani Israil (The Children of Israel)\"Say, 'Call upon Allah or call upon the Most Merciful. Whichever [name] you call - to Him belong the best names.'...\"Here we see that Allah teaches Muslims to call upon Him by the name Allah or the Most Merciful. Reading the Quran, we see the name Allah mentioned 2866 times. Remember, the Quran has 30 Juzus and 114 Surahs. So the God worshipped by Muslims according to the Quran is named Allah.The name of the God worshipped by Christians is this:Exodus 6:2-3\"God spoke to Moses and said to him, 'I am Jehovah. I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as God Almighty, but by my name Jehovah I did not make myself known to them.'\"Here we see that the God we Christians worship identifies His name as Jehovah. In the Bible, the word or name \"LORD\" in English translates to Jehovah, indicating a very holy name of God. This name is mentioned 6751 times in the Bible. Remember, the Bible has a total of 66 books, 1189 chapters, and 31,102 verses.3. Is the Chief Angel of Allah the Same as Jehovah's?If Allah is Jehovah, then it is clear that the chief angel would also be the same. If not the same, then the chief angels are different. Let's first look at how Allah narrates in the Quran, and he says...**Quran 81:19-21 Surah At-Takwir (The Overthrowing/The Folding Up)**\"Indeed, the Quran is a word conveyed by a noble messenger (Gabriel), Who is possessed of power and with the Owner of the Throne, secure [in position], Obeyed there [in the heavens] and trustworthy.\"The explanation of these verses inside the Quran teaches that the noble messenger and the one obeyed in the heavens is Gabriel, who is the chief of all angels.The chief angel of the God Jehovah is this:Jude 1:9\"But Michael the archangel, when he disputed with the devil and argued about the body of Moses, did not dare pronounce against him a railing judgment, but said, 'The Lord rebuke you!'\"Here we see the verses clearly teaching that the chief angel of the God named Allah is called Gabriel, while the chief angel of our God Jehovah is called Michael. The question is: Since these angels are different, is Allah the same as Jehovah? To know more about the differences between the angels, get a copy of the lesson: \"Is Gabriel the Same as Jibril?\" We have that lesson; get a copy.4. Who is the Creator, Allah or Jehovah?Everyone who follows religion believes that God is the creator who created humans, animals, and all we see and do not see. So it is appropriate to look at what is said by Jehovah about creation and what Allah says. Do their statements agree or differ?Who Was Man Created in the Image of?Allah says this:Quran 112:1-4 Surah Al-Ikhlas (The Purity/The Sincerity)\"Say, 'He is Allah, [who is] One, Allah, the Eternal Refuge. He neither begets nor is born, Nor is there to Him any equivalent.'\"According to this verse, Allah says that God neither begets nor is born and that there is no one comparable to Him. Jehovah says this about man...Genesis 1:26-27\"Then God said, 'Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over the cattle and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.' God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.\"Here we see that our God Jehovah created man in His own image, but Allah says there is no one comparable to Him. The question for you, the follower: Is Allah Jehovah? Please read these verses to know more (Genesis 5:1-2, 9:6, 1 Corinthians 11:7, Colossians 1:15, 3:10, Acts 17:28-29, James 3:9). You might ask, \"In what way does God resemble me?\" Know that God is Spirit (John 4:24) and He gave us the breath (spirit of life) (Genesis 2:7). Moreover, God is the Father of our spirits (Hebrews 12:9), and He says our spirits belong to Him (Ezekiel 18:4, Numbers 16:22).Swearing by God about CreationQuran 91:1-7 Surah Ash-Shams (The Sun)\"By the sun and its brightness, And by the moon when it follows it, And by the day when it displays it, And by the night when it covers it, And by the sky and He who constructed it, And by the earth and He who spread it, And by the soul and He who proportioned it.\"Quran 92:1-3 Surah Al-Lail (The Night)\"By the night when it covers, And by the day when it appears, And by [the One] who created the male and the female.\"Here we see that Allah swears by the sky and He who constructed it, by the earth and He who spread it. Who is this spreader of the earth and the builder of the sky? The Quran continues to narrate...Quran 45:22 Surah Al-Jathiyah (The Kneeling)\"And Allah created the heavens and the earth in truth...\"Quran 44:7-8 Surah Ad-Dukhan (The Smoke)\"[He is] the Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them, if you should be certain. There is no deity except Him; He gives life and causes death. [He is] your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers.\"Here we see that Allah, through the Quran, says that Allah created the heavens and the earth, and again he says there is no deity except Him. The builder of the sky and the spreader of the earth says this...Isaiah 44:24\"Thus says the LORD, your Redeemer, and the one who formed you from the womb, 'I, the LORD, am the maker of all things, stretching out the heavens by Myself and spreading out the earth all alone.'\"Our God Jehovah says, \"I make all things.\" (Read Isaiah 45:6-7, 11-12, Jeremiah 27:5). Surely Jehovah is the creator of all things.Did God Jehovah Swear by the Things He Created like Allah?Isaiah 45:22-23\"Turn to Me and be saved, all the ends of the earth; For I am God, and there is no other. I have sworn by Myself; The word has gone forth from My mouth in righteousness And will not turn back, That to Me every knee will bow, every tongue will swear allegiance.\"Hebrews 6:13-16\"For when God made the promise to Abraham, since He could swear by no one greater, He swore by Himself, saying, 'I will surely bless you and I will surely multiply you.' And so, having patiently waited, he obtained the promise. For men swear by one greater than themselves, and with them an oath given as confirmation is an end of every dispute.\"Here we see that our God Jehovah does not swear by any person or the things He created, like Allah swears, but Jehovah says, \"I swear by Myself.\" You can also read how Jehovah swore by Himself in these verses: (Isaiah 14:24 and Genesis 22:16).5. The City Chosen by Allah, Is It the Same as Jehovah's?The City of Allah:Quran 27:91 Surah An-Naml (The Ants)\"I have only been commanded to worship the Lord of this city (Makkah), who made it sacred and to whom belongs all things...\"Quran 3:96 Surah Aal-Imran (The Family of Imran)\"Indeed, the first House [of worship] established for mankind was that at Makkah - blessed and a guidance for the worlds.\"Quran 106:3-4 Surah Quraysh (The Quraysh)\"So let them worship the Lord of this House (the Kaaba), Who has fed them, [saving them] from hunger and made them safe, [saving them] from fear.\"Thus, we see that Allah is the Lord of the Kaaba according to these verses, and the Kaaba is in Makkah. Through these verses, we see that Allah, the god worshipped by Muslims, has chosen the city of Makkah as his holy city, and Muhammad (s.a.w) was commanded to worship the Lord of this city of Makkah, who is Allah.What city did our God Jehovah choose? Continue reading...The City Chosen by Our God Jehovah Is This...2 Chronicles 6:4-6\"He said, 'Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who spoke with His mouth to my father David and has fulfilled it with His hands, saying, ‘Since the day that I brought My people out of the land of Egypt, I did not choose a city out of all the tribes of Israel in which to build a house that My name might be there, nor did I choose any man for a leader over My people Israel; but I have chosen Jerusalem that My name might be there, and I have chosen David to be over My people Israel.’\"The Scriptures do not mention any other city chosen by our God here on earth except the city of Jerusalem. (See 2 Chronicles 12:13, Ezra 6:12; 7:15,27; Psalms 26:8; Zechariah 2:12)Through these verses, we see that our God Jehovah, His chosen city is Jerusalem. The name Jerusalem is in Hebrew and means \"foundation of peace.\" Even when the Israelites were far from the city of Jerusalem, they knelt and faced Jerusalem. (See Daniel 6:10). The city chosen by Jehovah is Jerusalem, and the city chosen by Allah is Makkah. And this is the difference between the city of Allah and Jehovah.6. How Does Allah Teach about Purifying the Soul, Is It the Same as Jehovah?Allah teaches this...Quran 53:32 Surah An-Najm (The Star)\"Those who avoid the major sins and immoralities, only [committing] slight ones - indeed, your Lord is vast in forgiveness. He was most knowing of you when He produced you from the earth and when you were fetuses in the wombs of your mothers. So do not claim yourselves to be pure...\"Quran 12:53 Surah Yusuf (Joseph)\"And I do not acquit myself. Indeed, the soul is a persistent enjoiner of evil,except those upon which my Lord has mercy. Indeed, my Lord is Forgiving and Merciful.\"According to the Quran, Allah instructs people not to purify themselves and again says, \"I do not purify myself.\" This is very surprising!Our God Jehovah says this about purifying the soul, i.e., holiness:Isaiah 43:3\"For I am the LORD your God, The Holy One of Israel, your Savior; I have given Egypt as your ransom, Cush and Seba in your place.\"Here we see that God says, \"I am the Holy One.\" This is also a descriptive name for our God Jehovah. In Hebrew, it is called \"Kadosh.\" The Prophet Isaiah has written that God is Holy 32 times. For a quick reference, read Isaiah 40:25, 48:17, and 57:15. Moreover, because our God Jehovah is holy, He instructed us thus...Leviticus 11:44\"For I am the LORD your God. Consecrate yourselves therefore, and be holy, for I am holy. And you shall not make yourselves unclean with any of the swarming things that swarm on the earth.\"The Apostle Peter instructs us thus:1 Peter 1:15-16\"But like the Holy One who called you, be holy yourselves also in all your behavior; because it is written, 'You shall be holy, for I am holy.'\"The Apostle Paul also instructed to purify the soul and be holy (2 Corinthians 7:1).You can also read this instruction to be holy in Leviticus 19:2, 20:26.Therefore, we see that Jehovah commands us to purify our souls to be holy, but Allah commands Muslims not to purify their souls.Question for you, the follower: Is Allah Jehovah?7. Is Jehovah's Heaven the Same as Allah's Paradise (Heaven)?Jehovah's Heaven:Luke 20:34-36\"Jesus said to them, 'The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage, but those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage; for they cannot even die anymore, because they are like angels, and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.'\"These Scriptures assure Christians that when we are resurrected and enter heaven, there will be no marriage because we will have spiritual bodies (1 Corinthians 15:43-54). Additionally, the Scriptures teach us that the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit (Romans 14:17). Our God teaches clearly that in heaven in His kingdom, there is no hunger or thirst or sun to beat down on us (Revelation 7:16-17).Allah's Paradise or Heaven will be like this:i. MansionsQuran 39:20 Surah Az-Zumar (The Groups)\"But those who have feared their Lord will have chambers, above them chambers built high, beneath which rivers flow. [This is] the promise of Allah. Allah does not fail in [His] promise.\"ii. Rivers of water, milk, wine, honey, and fruitsQuran 47:15 Surah Muhammad\"The description of Paradise, which the righteous are promised, is that in it are rivers of water unaltered, rivers of milk the taste of which never changes, rivers of wine delicious to those who drink, and rivers of purified honey, in which they will have from all kinds of fruits and forgiveness from their Lord. [Are they] like those who abide eternally in the Fire and are given to drink scalding water that will sever their intestines?\"iii. They will have women of certain kinds and bird meatQuran 56:15-23 Surah Al-Waqi'ah (The Inevitable) - I quote verses 21-23 only\"And meat of fowl, from whatever they desire. And [for them are] fair women with large, [beautiful] eyes, The likenesses of pearls well-protected.\"Quran 37:48-49 Surah As-Saffat (Those who set the Ranks)\"And with them will be women limiting [their] glances, with large, [beautiful] eyes, As if they were [delicate] eggs, well-protected.\"Quran 37:44-46 Surah As-Saffat (Those who set the Ranks)\"They will be on thrones facing each other. Circulated among them will be a cup [of wine] from a flowing spring, White and delicious to the drinkers.\"Through these verses, we have seen that Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala, the god worshipped by Muslims, has promised to admit Muslims into paradise (heaven) where they will have rivers of water, rivers of milk, wine, and honey. They will also have fruits, bird meat, and will be married off to women with large eyes like ostrich eggs and others with large eyes like cups.The surprising thing is when we read the book of Hadith, because the faith of Islam is also built on the books of Hadith. Read...Quran 42:10 Surah Ash-Shura (The Consultation)\"And in anything over which you disagree - its ruling is [to be referred] to Allah. [Say], 'That is Allah, my Lord; upon Him I have relied, and to Him I turn back.'\"When we read the book of Hadith of the Prophet called Sunan Ibn Majah vol 5 page 546 Hadith No: 4337, there are these explanations:Narrated Abu Umama: The Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said Allah will not allow anyone to enter paradise but Allah the Mighty and Glorious will marry him with seventy-two wives. Two will be virgins (Huris) with big eyes, and seventy will be his inheritance from the people (husbands) who were thrown into Hellfire. Each one of them (the women) will have a pleasant vagina, and the man’s sexual organ will not bend down (during intercourse) but will last long.In English, this Hadith reads:Abu Umama (Allah be pleased with him) reported that Allah's messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said Allah will not admit anyone into Paradise but Allah the Mighty and Glorious, will marry him with seventy-two wives. Two will be from virgins (Huris) with big eyes, and seventy will be his inheritance from the people of Hellfire. Each one of them will have a pleasant vagina, and the man’s sexual organ will not bend down (during sexual intercourse) but will last long.This is what Allah, the God of Muslims, has promised. This is something that surprises a Christian greatly because what is taught by Allah is not found at all with our God Jehovah. Here on earth is where there is wine, fruits, bird meat, marrying, mansions, cars, rivers, seas, and other things.Consider, who is this Allah?8. What Is the End of Those Who Worship Allah?We know that Christians will live with our God Jehovah forever (see 1 Thessalonians 4:13-17 and Revelation 21:3-7). Thus, our God is eternal. But when we read the Quran and the Hadith of Muhammad, the Prophet of the Muslims, we see these teachings...Quran 51:56 Surah Adh-Dhariyat (The Winnowing Winds)\"And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me.\"Quran 6:128 Surah Al-An'am (The Cattle)\"And [mention, O Muhammad], the Day when He will gather them all and say, 'O company of jinn, you have misled many of mankind.' And their allies among mankind will say, 'Our Lord, we benefited from each other, and we have reached our term which You appointed for us.' He will say, 'The Fire is your residence, wherein you will abide eternally, except for what Allah wills. Indeed, your Lord is Wise and Knowing.'\"In these verses, we see that the jinn along with all people will be thrown into the fire. How about Allah? When we read the book of Hadith of the Prophet (s.a.w) called Sahih al-Bukhari Vol: VI Hadith No: 371. Page 353, there are these words:Quran 50:30 Surah Qaf (The Letter Qaf)\"On the Day We will say to Hell, 'Have you been filled?' and it will say, 'Are there any more?'\"Narrated Anas: The Prophet said, \"People will be thrown into the (Hell) Fire and it will say, 'Are there any more (to come)?' until Allah puts His Foot over it and it will say, 'Qat! Qat!' (Enough! Enough!)\"In English, this Hadith reads:Allah's statement: It (Hell) will say, \"Are there any more (to come)?\" (50:30). Narrated Anas: The Prophet said, \"People will be thrown into the (Hell) Fire and it will say, 'Are there any more (to come)?' (50:30) till Allah puts His Foot over it and it will say, 'Qat! Qat!' (Enough! Enough!)\"In this verse, we see that Allah, the god of Muslims, asks Hell if it is full, and Hell will ask Allah, \"Are there any more?\" This question implies thatHell was not yet full.The explanation of this Hadith confirms that Allah will place His foot in Hell, and then Hell will say, \"Enough! Enough!\" meaning it is full with the act of Allah putting His foot there. This is completely different from our God Jehovah, who has prepared Hell specifically for the wicked, the devil, and his angels. Please read these verses: Matthew 25:41, 46, Revelation 20:10, 21:8.All these verses show that the end of the wicked, the devil, and his angels is in the lake of fire. Question for you, dear friend, who is Allah?I hope that through the Quran, the Bible, and the Hadith of the Prophet Muhammad, you have been able to learn in depth that Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala, the god worshipped by Muslims, is not Jehovah, the God we Christians worship.ShalomDr. Max Shimba for Max Shimba Ministries Org",

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba | Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis article offers a critical and comparative theological examination of the divinity of Jesus Christ in both Christianity and Islam. While the Bible explicitly affirms Jesus as divine, eternal, and sovereign, the Quran presents a differing view, denying the deity of Christ and affirming strict monotheism through the person of Allah. This study seeks to explore, from a scholarly perspective, what each of these two Abrahamic faiths teaches concerning the identity of Jesus and the nature of God, using authoritative texts—the Bible and the Quran—as the primary sources of analysis.IntroductionThe question \"Is Jesus God?\" remains one of the most defining and debated theological inquiries in human history. The answer to this question divides the world's two largest religions—Christianity and Islam. Christianity holds that Jesus is the divine Son of God, the second Person of the Trinity, eternally existing with God the Father and the Holy Spirit. Islam, on the other hand, maintains that Jesus (Isa) is a revered prophet, but categorically denies His divinity, asserting that Allah alone is God.This article explores how each faith constructs its understanding of divinity and attributes such as eternity, omnipotence, and finality, focusing especially on the titles given to God and Jesus in their respective scriptures.The Eternity of God and Christ: A Comparative ViewIn the Quran, Allah is referred to by 99 beautiful names (Asma al-Husna) that describe His nature and attributes. Two of these names are especially relevant to our discussion:Al-Awwal(ٱلْأَوَّلُ) –The First, found inSurah Al-Hadid (57:3):\"He is the First and the Last, the Ascendant and the Intimate, and He is, of all things, Knowing.\"This name underscores the eternal pre-existence of Allah, an attribute central to Islamic theology.Al-Akhir(ٱلْآخِرُ) –The Last, also inQuran 57:3, indicating God’s unending nature and absolute finality.In Christian theology, similar attributes are used to describe Jesus Christ. In fact, Revelation 1:8 records Jesus saying:“I am the Alpha and the Omega,”says the Lord God,“who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty.”(Revelation 1:8, NIV)Alpha and Omega are the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet, symbolizing the fullness of time and being. These titles echo the same eternal qualities attributed to God in the Old Testament (cf. Isaiah 44:6), but they are here used directly by Jesus, claiming the very nature and identity of God.Moreover, Revelation 22:13 further affirms this:“I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.”In this, Jesus not only parallels but directly claims the divine titles of Yahweh, indicating that He shares in the eternal nature of God.The Biblical Evidence for the Deity of ChristThe New Testament is rich with Christological affirmations of Jesus’ divinity. For example:John 1:1-3:“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God... Through Him all things were made.”Colossians 1:16-17:“For in Him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth... all things have been created through Him and for Him.”Hebrews 1:3:“The Son is the radiance of God’s glory and the exact representation of His being, sustaining all things by His powerful word.”These passages affirm not only Jesus' eternal preexistence but also His role in creation, a function attributed only to God in Jewish monotheism.The Quranic Rejection of Christ’s DivinityWhile the Quran honors Jesus (Isa) as a prophet and the Messiah, it strictly denies that He is divine or that He is the Son of God.Surah Al-Ikhlas (112:1-4):\"Say: He is Allah, [who is] One, Allah, the Eternal Refuge. He neither begets nor is born, nor is there to Him any equivalent.\"Surah An-Nisa (4:171):“...Say not ‘Three’; desist—it is better for you. Indeed, Allah is but one God. Exalted is He above having a son.”Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:72):“They have certainly disbelieved who say, ‘Allah is the Messiah, the son of Mary’...”From the Quranic perspective, associating Jesus with God (known asshirk) is a grave theological error. Islam's monotheism (tawhid) is uncompromising, and any claim of divine sonship is considered blasphemous.Theological ImplicationsThe tension between ChristianTrinitarianismand IslamicTawhidis unbridgeable on doctrinal grounds. Christianity's assertion that Jesus is both fully God and fully man—God incarnate—lies at the heart of the Gospel. The Quran's denial of this identity creates an irreconcilable divergence.Yet, both scriptures ascribe eternal titles—The Beginning and The End—to the divine. The critical distinction is that the Bible attributes these titles directly to Jesus Christ, implying His full participation in the divine nature. In contrast, the Quran reserves these names for Allah alone and considers any sharing of these attributes a violation of monotheism.ConclusionThis comparative theological study demonstrates that the Bible and the Quran offer fundamentally different views on the identity and nature of Jesus. In Christianity, Jesus is not merely a prophet but God incarnate—eternal, omnipotent, and worthy of worship. In Islam, Jesus is a revered messenger but strictly human, subordinate to Allah, and never divine.Thus, the question,Is Jesus God?is not merely a matter of interpretation but of doctrinal allegiance. For the Christian, Jesus is \"the image of the invisible God\" (Colossians 1:15), the eternal Logos who \"became flesh\" (John 1:14). For the Muslim, such a belief is incompatible with the core tenets of Islamic monotheism.About the AuthorDr. Maxwell Shimba is a theologian, apologist, and founder of the Shimba Theological Institute.

    "full_content": "Title: IF JESUS’ SUBMISSION TO HIS FATHER MAKES HIM A MUSLIM, THEN WHO IS ALLAH’S SON?Author: Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionIslamic apologists frequently argue that Jesus was a Muslim because He submitted to the will of God. They anchor this on the Arabic definition of \"Islam\" (submission) and \"Muslim\" (one who submits to God). However, this argument is not only linguistically shallow, but theologically incoherent when analyzed through the lenses of both Christian doctrine and Islamic theology. If submission alone defines a person as Muslim, then Abraham, Moses, David, and even Satan—who at times obeyed God's command—could qualify. Yet, the core of Islamic theology rejects the very foundation upon which Jesus operated: the intimate relationship with God asHis Father.Hence, we pose a question that penetrates the heart of Islamic theology and exposes its inherent contradictions:“Is Allah a Father in any sense?”I. Submission in Context: Jesus and the FatherChristianity does not define Jesus merely by His submission to God, but by His uniqueSonshipanddivine identity. Jesus' submission (e.g., Luke 22:42 –\"Not my will, but yours be done\") is a relational act within the Trinity—between theSon and the Father—not a servile obedience between a slave and master.“I and the Father are one.” (John 10:30)This declaration, to Christians, affirms not just submission butunity in essence, co-equality, and mutual love. Islam, on the other hand,categorically deniesthis relationship. According to the Quran:“Say: He is Allah, the One and Only; Allah, the Eternal, Absolute; He begets not, nor is He begotten.” (Surah Al-Ikhlas 112:1–3)This verse refutes any notion of divine Fatherhood or Sonship, making the Islamic God (Allah) completelynon-relational.So the question arises: If Jesus' submission makes Him a Muslim, then towhomdid He submit? Clearly, not to theAllahof the Quran, who denies having any son. Jesus called God“Abba” (Father)(Mark 14:36), a term utterly alien and evenblasphemousin Islamic theology.II. Is Allah a Father in Any Sense?In Christianity, God is revealed as aFather:To Jesus uniquely (Matthew 3:17),To believers spiritually (John 1:12),And as Creator of all (Malachi 2:10).Islam, however, denounces all three:Not the Father of Jesus– Surah 4:171:“Do not say ‘Three.’ Cease! It is better for you. Allah is only one God. Far be it from His glory to have a son.”Not a spiritual father– Allah hasslaves(abd), notsons(ibn).Not a relational father even in metaphor– Surah 5:18 rebukes Jews and Christians:“The Jews and the Christians say, ‘We are the sons of Allah and His beloved.’ Say: Why then does He punish you for your sins?”In effect,Allah is not a father in any relational, redemptive, or theological sense. This makes submission to Allah fundamentally different from submission to the Father of Jesus Christ. Jesus’ submission was an act ofdivine love, not merely obligation.III. Jesus the Son vs. Muhammad the ServantChristians believe that Jesus is:Theeternal Wordmade flesh (John 1:14),Theonly begotten Son(John 3:16),Theradiance of God’s glory(Hebrews 1:3).Muslims claim Muhammad is theservant and messengerof Allah (*‘abd’ and *‘rasul’), but reject any divine Sonship. Thus, Jesus stands inrelational intimacywith the Father, while Muhammad stands as adistant slaveto a master.To equate Jesus' submission to Muslim submission is acategory mistake. It ignores Christ's divine origin, eternal Sonship, and pre-incarnate glory:“Before Abraham was, I am.” (John 8:58)If Jesus' obedience to the Father makes Him a Muslim, thenAbraham’s obedienceto sacrifice his son should make him Christian—since the Bible says it wasIsaac, not Ishmael (Genesis 22:2). Why the double standard?IV. The Fatal Flaw in Muslim ApologeticsMuslim apologists rely on semantics—“Islam” meaning submission—to retroactively claim biblical figures. But that’s historical revisionism. Submission to God in general doesn’t define a person as Muslim in the Quranic sense unless it’s toAllah as defined by Muhammad. Yet none of the prophets ever mentioned in the Bibleknew Allah, or affirmed theShahada(declaration that Muhammad is Allah’s prophet).Therefore, to say Jesus is a Muslim is to say:Jesus believed Muhammad was a prophet (He didn’t).Jesus denied being the Son of God (He didn’t).Jesus never called God “Father” (He did constantly).These are lies the Quran tells against the historical Jesus.V. Crushing the Myth: Jesus Cannot Be a MuslimLinguistic Submission ≠ Islamic Muslim: Submission is universal; Islam is specific to Muhammad’s theology.Allah ≠ the Father: If Jesus’ Father is not Allah, then Jesus wasn’t submitting to Allah.No Sonship in Islam: Without the Son, there is no Father. And without the Father, there is no true understanding of Jesus’ identity.Jesus was crucified(historical fact) – Islam denies this (Surah 4:157), proving it preachesanother Jesus(2 Corinthians 11:4).Conclusion: Submission Alone Doesn’t Define IslamThe attempt to redefine Jesus as a Muslim on the grounds of submission is a theological deception. It erases the intimate divine relationship between the Son and the Father and tries to replace it with a master-slave dynamic foreign to Jesus’ mission and message.So to every Muslim claiming Jesus was a Muslim because He submitted:Was Allah His Father? If not, then Jesus was not a Muslim—He is the Son of the Living God.“And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son to be the Savior of the world.” (1 John 4:14)End of Debate.Dr. Maxwell ShimbaRestorative Justice Practitioner, Bible Scholar, Founder of USA Theological UniversityPresident, Shimba Theological Institute",

Yet such a claim collapses under the weight of historical truth and biblical theology. Let us examine carefully:Jesus is not a “Muslim” nor simply a “prophet” — Jesus is the CHRIST — the very foundation of Christianity, its beginning, and its living center.1️⃣ Jesus is theChrist— Not Merely a ProphetThe Greek wordChristos(Χριστός) meansAnointed One,equivalent to the HebrewMessiah(משיח). In the Bible, Jesus is explicitly declared as the Christ:“Simon Peter answered and said,Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.”—Matthew 16:16 (KJV)The Qur’an never acknowledges Jesus asthe Christin the biblical sense — though it uses the titleal-Masihwithout understanding its deep theological meaning. Islam strips the term of its Jewish and Christian messianic significance. Yet according to the Bible, the role of the Christ is utterly unique — He is:✅ the fulfillment of prophecy (Isaiah 53, Daniel 9:24-27)✅ the divine Son (Psalm 2:7, John 1:1-14)✅ the Redeemer of mankind through the Cross (1 Corinthians 15:3-4)2️⃣ Jesus is theBeginning of ChristianityWithout Jesus, there is no Christianity — for Christianity is not a system of law, not an ethnic culture, not merely moral teachings — it is the Gospel of the person and work ofJesus Christ.“For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.”—1 Corinthians 3:11 (KJV)Christianity begins with Christ’s Incarnation, reaches its climax at the Cross and Resurrection, and proclaims His Kingdom until His return. No Jesus, no Cross, no Resurrection — no Christianity.Islam, on the other hand, speaks of Isa as a forerunner to Muhammad — but this reverses the divine order. It is Jesus who is the apex of divine revelation:“God… hath in these last days spoken unto us by His Son…”—Hebrews 1:1-2 (KJV)3️⃣ Jesus is Not aChristianin the Sense of Being a Follower of HimselfAnother common Muslim confusion is to ask: “Was Jesus a Christian?”This is a category error. AChristianis afollower of Christ.Jesus is not a follower of Himself — Heisthe Christ. He is the one we follow!“I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by Me.”—John 14:6 (KJV)He is the Head of the Body (Colossians 1:18), the firstborn from the dead (Revelation 1:5), and the Alpha and Omega (Revelation 22:13).Christiansare named after Him because we belong to Him:“And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.”—Acts 11:26 (KJV)Thus, to suggest that Jesus is “Muslim” or a mere prophet in line with Muhammad utterly misses the reality: Jesus existed long before Muhammad, long before Islam, and is the fulfillment ofGod’s eternal redemptive plan(Ephesians 1:4-10).4️⃣ Conclusion to Muslim ReadersDear Muslim friends: recognize the unique identity of Jesus the Christ. Without Jesus, there is no Christianity. He is not “one of the prophets” awaiting Muhammad — He is the Lord, the Savior, the beginning and foundation of the faith that brings eternal life (John 3:16).No Muhammad, no Islam — but without Jesus, there is no Christianity, no salvation, no Kingdom of God on earth.It is time to stop reducing Jesus to a mere prophet. Receive Him for who He truly is:JESUS IS THE CHRIST — THE SON OF THE LIVING GOD — THE BEGINNING AND LORD OF CHRISTIANITY.—By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

Do you believe this?\"Here, Jesus makes a direct and clear claim—not metaphorical, not future tense—He is the Resurrection Himself.The Quran’s Claim: Allah asAl-Ba’ithIn Islam, one ofAllah’s 99 namesisAl-Ba’ith, meaning“The Resurrector” or “The Resurrection.”Since Allah’s names are inseparable from His essence,Allah = Al-Ba’ith.Quran, Surah Al-Hajj 22:5, 7O mankind! If you are in doubt concerning the Resurrection, then verily We have created you from dust...And verily, the Hour will come, there is no doubt about it, and Allah will resurrect those who are in the graves.However, there’s a theological problem here:👉The people of Muhammad’s time doubted Allah’s ability to resurrect, precisely because they had never seen Him raise anyone from the dead!👉There was no evidence, no recorded miracle.How, then, can Allah rightfully claim the titleAl-Ba’ithwithout ever performing a resurrection?The Evidence of Jesus: A Public ResurrectionBy contrast,Jesus provided public, irrefutable evidencethat He isAl-Ba’ithby raisingLazarusfrom the dead—witnessedby many:John 11:23-25Jesus said to her, \"Your brother will rise again.\"Martha said, \"I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.\"Jesus said to her, \"I am the resurrection and the life.\"And inJohn 11:43-44, the miracle unfolds:When He had said these things, He cried out with a loud voice, \"Lazarus, come out!\" The man who had died came out, his hands and feet bound with linen strips, and his face wrapped with a cloth. Jesus said to them, \"Unbind him, and let him go.\"This event occurred632 years before Muhammadandbefore the Quran was revealed.👉 Jesus did not merely claim the title—He proved itthrough miraculous action.What Does the Quran Show?In my careful study of the Quran, I have found:👉No account of Allah raising anyone from the dead—not even Muhammad himself.👉 The titleAl-Ba’ithin the Quran remainsunsupported by evidence.👉 Allah asks people to “believe” He will resurrect the dead—but no demonstration was given, either during Muhammad’s lifetime or in the Quranic narrative.The Ultimate QuestionSo now, dear reader, consider:👉Between Jesus—who physically raised the dead—and Allah—who merely adopted the title without proof—who is the trueAl-Ba’ith?✅ Is itJesus, whose actions confirm His divine authority?❌ OrAllah, whose claim lacks demonstrated power?The VerdictFor me, and for all who seek truth, the answer is crystal clear:Jesus Christ isAl-Ba’ith—the Resurrection and the Life!He alone holds the power over life and death, proven by His works, His own resurrection, and His eternal victory over the grave.Titus 2:13\"...looking for the blessed hope and glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ.\"Shalom.Dr. Maxwell ShimbaServant of Jesus Christ, the Great God.Founder, Shimba Theological Institute",

    "full_content": "A Theological and Textual Challenge to Islamic ClaimsBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionAmong the persistent demands of Muslim apologists in interfaith dialogues is the challenge to Christians to produce averbatimstatement from Jesus in the Bible: \"I am God; worship Me.\" This demand for explicit wording is often used to undermine the doctrine of Christ’s divinity, despite the abundance of scriptural testimony to Jesus' divine nature through explicit and implicit statements, titles, and actions.Curiously, this same criterion, when turned toward the foundations of Islamic claims regarding the Torah (Tawrat), exposes a significant textual and theological gap. Muslims universally affirm that Allah revealed the Torah directly to Moses, yet upon close inspection, the Qur’an does not contain a single verse where Allahdirectlyandexplicitlysays to Moses, \"I gave you the Torah.\" Instead, the relevant verses are indirect or constructed through conjunctions and narrative summary, not through direct divine address.This article, therefore, poses a critical question to Muslim theologians and apologists:Where in the Qur’an does Allah, in His own words, say to Moses, \"I gave you the Torah\"?If such explicitness is the standard for Christian claims, let it be applied fairly and equally to the Islamic claim regarding the Torah and Moses.1. Qur’anic Passages Commonly CitedSurah 5:44“Indeed, We revealed the Torah, in which was guidance and light...”(Qur’an 5:44)This verse is clear that Allah claims to have revealed the Torah, but it is entirely silent about the recipient. There is no direct reference to Moses in this verse, nor does Allah say, \"O Moses, I have given you the Torah.\" It is a general statement about the Torah, not its transmission.Surah 32:23“And We certainly gave Moses the Scripture, so do not be in doubt over his meeting. And We made it [i.e., the Torah] guidance for the Children of Israel.”(Qur’an 32:23)Here, Allah says He gave “the Scripture” (al-kitab) to Moses. However, the Arabic does not specify “the Torah” in this clause; rather, it uses the generic word “scripture” and then, in a separate sentence, states that the Torah was made a guidance for the Children of Israel. The structure is conjunctive, not directly attributive. The Torah is not directly named as that which was given to Moses in the same breath.Surah 7:144–145“[Allah] said, ‘O Moses, I have chosen you over the people with My messages and My words to you...’ And We wrote for him on the tablets something of all things...”(Qur’an 7:144–145)Again, there is reference to “tablets” and “messages,” but the term \"Torah\" does not occur here, nor is there an explicit divine declaration: \"I have given you the Torah.\"Surah 6:154“Then We gave Moses the Scripture, making complete [Our favor] upon the one who did good and as a detailed explanation of all things...”(Qur’an 6:154)As in 32:23, the text speaks of “the Scripture” (al-kitab), but not “the Torah” (al-Tawrat). The connection between \"the Scripture\" and \"the Torah\" is made by tradition, not by the explicit words of the Qur’an itself.2. The Polemic of Explicitness: Applying the Muslim StandardMuslim polemics demand that Christians provide a direct, first-person quotation from Jesus saying, “I am God,” for the claim of His divinity to be valid. This standard is rigid and rarely applied consistently to Islamic doctrines. If we apply the same standard, we must ask:Where does Allah say, in His own words, \"O Moses, I gave you the Torah\"?Or, at the very least:Where does the Qur’an record a conversation where Allah says to Moses, \"I am giving you the Torah\"?Despite repeated references to \"scripture\" (al-kitab), \"tablets,\" and \"guidance,\" the Qur’an never contains the verbatim phrase: \"O Moses, I gave you the Torah.\" Instead, Muslim belief that Moses received the Torah is inferred through exegesis, secondary hadith sources, and traditional interpretations, rather than on the basis of explicit Qur’anic language.3. Theological and Hermeneutical ImplicationsThe absence of an explicit, direct statement from Allah to Moses regarding the Torah challenges the consistency of Muslim polemics. If Muslim doctrine rests upon inference, analogy, and interpretive tradition to assert that Moses received the Torah, then, by the same hermeneutical allowance, Christians are justified in affirming the divinity of Jesus through explicit and implicit biblical testimony, even where the exact phrase “I am God” is absent.Furthermore, the persistent demand for verbatim statements from Christian scripture is revealed to be arbitrary, selective, and ultimately self-refuting when the foundational claims of Islam itself cannot meet this bar.4. Conclusion: A Call for ConsistencyUntil and unless Muslim scholars can produce a verse from the Qur’an in which Allah, addressing Moses, says, \"I gave you the Torah,\" the Islamic claim that Moses received the Torah directly from Allah must be recognized as an inference rather than an explicit, verbatim divine statement. Consistency demands that either both traditions be allowed the interpretive space to affirm their beliefs, or both be rejected on the basis of the absence of explicit wording.Let those who demand, \"Where did Jesus say, 'I am God'?\" also be willing to answer,\"Where did Allah say to Moses, 'I gave you the Torah'?\"until then, the standard remains one of double measure.ReferencesQur’an 5:44, 32:23, 6:154, 7:144–145 (Sahih International and Yusuf Ali translations)Abdul Rahman Squires, “The Torah in the Qur’an,” Muslim ApologeticsGerald R.

While the mainstream Muslim position is clear that Jesus is regarded as a prophet and not divine, a close and literal reading of Surah At-Tawbah 9:31 introduces compelling questions. In this article, we will analyze whether the Qur’an, by its very grammar and structure, actually places Jesus alongside Allah as one who is to be worshiped.The Verse in QuestionSurah At-Tawbah 9:31 reads:“They take their rabbis and their monks as lords apart from Allah, and also the Messiah, son of Mary, whereas they were commanded to worship none but the One True God.” (9:31)A critical point is the phrase:“apart from Allah, and also the Messiah, son of Mary.”The Power of Conjunction: The Meaning of \"And\"The word“and”(Arabic:wa) is universally recognized as a conjunction that connects equal entities, persons, or objects. In this context, the conjunction grammatically unitesAllahandthe Messiah, son of Mary. The verse thus lists both Allah and the Messiah as those distinct from rabbis and monks, suggesting they share a unique status as “lords.”If the intent of the verse was merely to condemn the worship of any being except Allah, it would have sufficed to mention Allah alone. Instead, the addition of “and the Messiah, son of Mary” implies that the Messiah, too, is not to be placed in the category of created beings wrongly taken as lords, but rather is set apart with Allah as a legitimate object of worship.Reading the Verse LiterallyA plain, literal reading yields:They (Jews and Christians) take their religious leaders as lordsapart fromAllah and also the Messiah.This means: Rabbis and monks are wrongly elevated, but Allah and the Messiah are not among those false lords; they are the exception.Therefore, the text suggests that the only true Lords—those to be worshiped—areAllah and the Messiah.This interpretation is reinforced by the wording:“whereas they were commanded to worship none but the One True God.”The reference to “the One True God” immediately after mentioning both Allah and the Messiah opens the possibility that, in this context, both are subsumed under this divine identity.Implications for Christian-Muslim DialogueFor Christians, this reading resonates powerfully with the doctrine of the divinity of Jesus, the Messiah. The verse, by grammatical necessity, identifies both Allah and the Messiah as those who should be recognized as lords, in contrast to the false lordship attributed to rabbis and monks.For Muslims, such an interpretation presents a challenge to the classical doctrine oftawhid(absolute monotheism), yet it arises directly from the conjunction “and” and the logical structure of the verse. The literal sense does not support the exclusion of Jesus from divinity but, in fact, does the opposite.Counterpoints and ResponseIt is true that most Islamic commentators, both classical and modern, have interpreted this verse as a condemnation of Christians who wrongly worship Jesus, rather than as an endorsement. However, such interpretations may be influenced by pre-existing theological commitments, rather than a strict adherence to the grammatical and logical flow of the text itself. A fresh, unbiased reading demands that we allow the verse to speak for itself:Allah and the Messiah are both set apart as legitimate Lords to be worshipped.ConclusionA careful and honest reading of Surah At-Tawbah 9:31, considering the power of the conjunction “and,” shows that the verse elevates both Allah and the Messiah, son of Mary, above all other lords, and implicitly commands their worship. The text, therefore, provides scriptural evidence within the Qur’an itself that Jesus is to be worshiped as Lord, alongside Allah. This reading has profound implications for Christian-Muslim dialogue and invites renewed reflection on the identity of the Messiah in Islamic theology.Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteReferencesThe Qur’an, Surah At-Tawbah 9:31Basic Arabic GrammarDiscussions on conjunctions and logical structure in Semitic languages",

    "full_content": "IntroductionThe identification of Jesus as Jehovah (Yahweh)—the God of Israel—stands at the heart of historic Christian belief. However, this claim is highly contested and interpreted differently withinIslamic, Jewish, and secular scholarship. An academically robust discussion must not only examine the internal logic and scriptural claims of Christianity, but also fairly engage the perspectives and arguments of other traditions and critical scholars. This chapter presents a multi-angled exploration, outlining the Christian position while interacting with major objections and interpretations from other worldviews.1. Old Testament Prophecies: Messianic Expectations in Dialogue1.1 Christian PerspectiveChristians point to Isaiah 7:14, Isaiah 9:6, and Micah 5:2 as prophecies foretelling the incarnation of God. As shown previously, the titles “Immanuel” (“God with us”), “Mighty God,” and “from everlasting” are taken as clear pointers to the divine nature of the coming Messiah.1.2 Jewish ScholarshipJewish exegesis, both ancient and modern, interprets these prophecies differently:Isaiah 7:14: Most Jewish interpreters argue that the prophecy referred to a contemporary event in Isaiah’s time, with “Immanuel” likely being a child born as a sign to King Ahaz, rather than a distant messianic figure. The Hebrew wordalmahis understood as “young woman,” not necessarily “virgin.”1Isaiah 9:6: While Christians see this as a messianic and divine prophecy, Jewish commentators like Rashi and Ibn Ezra have argued that the “child” refers to Hezekiah or another historical king, and that the grand titles are either royal hyperbole or ascriptions to God, not the child himself.2Micah 5:2: Some rabbinic texts do associate this passage with the Messiah but stress that “from of old” (mi-yemai olam) refers to ancient Davidic lineage or God’s foreknowledge, not the Messiah’s pre-existence as God.31.3 Islamic PerspectiveIslamic theology does not accept any claim that God would incarnate or become human. Muslims revere Jesus (Isa) as a great prophet and Messiah, born miraculously of Mary (Qur’an 3:45–47), but strictly reject his divinity (Qur’an 5:72–73). Muslim apologists often argue that the Old Testament prophecies are misread by Christians, and that Jesus himself never claimed to be God in a manner consistent with later Trinitarian dogma.The Qur’an (4:171) explicitly instructs:“Say not ‘Three’: desist—it will be better for you; for Allah is One God…”Muslim exegetes often claim that the “Immanuel” prophecy points only to a sign of God’s nearness or support, not incarnation, and that Jesus’ miracles demonstrate prophetic authority, not divinity.1.4 Secular and Critical ScholarshipSecular biblical scholars, employing historical-critical methods, often argue:Many Old Testament passages cited as messianic prophecies are better understood in their original historical contexts, not as predictions of Jesus specifically.The Christian reading is often seen as a case of “pesher” or typological exegesis, where early Christians reinterpreted Hebrew texts in light of their experiences of Jesus.4Some scholars argue that ideas of a divine or semi-divine Messiah were not widespread in Second Temple Judaism, though recent studies (e.g., Larry Hurtado, Richard Bauckham) have shown that early Jewish Christians very early attributed divine status to Jesus in ways that require serious historical explanation.52. New Testament Declarations: Competing Interpretations2.1 Christian PositionChristian doctrine, as previously outlined, affirms that the New Testament writers—especially John and Paul—directly identify Jesus as God (Theos) and the pre-existent Logos through whom all things were made (John 1:1–14; Colossians 1:15–20; Hebrews 1:1–4).2.2 Jewish ObjectionsJudaism maintains strict monotheism (the Shema: Deut. 6:4). Jewish polemic from the second century onward rejected any notion that a human could be worshipped as God. The Talmudic tradition often portrays Jesus as a controversial figure, but never as divine, and argues that worship of Jesus is a violation of the first commandment.62.3 Islamic ObjectionsIslamic apologetics claim:The New Testament never records Jesus directly saying, “I am God, worship me.”The “Son of God” language is understood metaphorically or as a title for pious people, not as ontological equality with God. Qur’an 9:30–31 denounces any belief in divine sonship for Jesus.Muslim scholars like Shabir Ally or Zakir Naik highlight the “subordination” statements in the Gospels (e.g., John 14:28: “the Father is greater than I”) as evidence against Jesus’ divinity.2.4 Secular/Critical AnalysisBart Ehrman and other secular historians argue that the divinity of Jesus is a development within the early church, not necessarily Jesus’ own claim. Ehrman suggests the earliest Christian writings (such as Mark’s Gospel) portray Jesus as a divinely appointed human, while later texts (such as John’s Gospel) present a higher Christology.7Larry Hurtado and Richard Bauckham, as noted, challenge this, showing that worship of Jesus as divine began remarkably early among Jewish monotheists, suggesting the roots of this belief are not merely later mythologization but foundational to Christian identity.83. Jesus’ Divine Claims: Theological and Interfaith Debates3.1 “I Am” SayingsChristian:Jesus’ use of “I AM” (Greek:ego eimi) in John 8:58 is understood as a direct claim to divinity, referencing the divine name in Exodus 3:14.Jewish:Contemporary Jewish readers and some scholars view this as a claim to special authority or pre-existence in God’s plan, but not as a direct assertion of being YHWH.9Muslim:Muslims argue that “I am” could mean “I have been” (i.e., predestination), or refer to Jesus’ status as Messiah, not to divinity.3.2 Worship and ForgivenessChristian:Jesus accepts worship (Matthew 14:33), forgives sins (Mark 2:5–11), and claims all authority (Matthew 28:18)—all actions reserved for God.Jewish and Muslim:Both traditions consider these stories as later Christian embellishments or misunderstandings, insisting that true monotheism prohibits the worship of any but God. Jewish tradition highlights that no Jewish prophet ever accepted worship, and Islam notes that Jesus always points away from himself to God in heaven (see Mark 10:18, “Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone.”).3.3 The Father’s TestimonyChristian:Hebrews 1:8, where the Father calls the Son “God,” is seen as explicit and definitive.Jewish:Hebrew poetry can attribute divine characteristics to kings as God’s agents (cf. Psalm 45:6–7), but always within the strict bounds of monotheism.10Muslim:Qur’anic teaching insists that any such attribution is either metaphorical or a textual corruption.4. Secular, Historical, and Interfaith Dialogue4.1 Historical DevelopmentSecular historians recognize that the identification of Jesus as God is the most remarkable and distinctive aspect of early Christianity. The rapid emergence of “binitarian” or “incipient Trinitarian” devotion among Jewish Christians is unique among world religions and demands explanation.11 Secular scholars debate whether this was based on genuine experiences of Jesus (e.g., resurrection appearances) or was an adaptation of Hellenistic religious ideas.4.2 Interfaith DialogueChristian theologians like N.T. Wright argue that the New Testament redefines Jewish monotheism around Jesus, rather than breaking from it.12Jewish-Christian dialogue today explores Jesus as a historical Jew and attempts to reclaim him for Jewish thought while still rejecting divine status.Islamic-Christian dialogue stresses the unity and transcendence of God (tawhid) and invites Christians to monotheism as defined by the Qur’an, while many Christians seek to clarify the Trinitarian doctrine as consistent with monotheism (not tritheism).ConclusionThe question of whether Jesus is Jehovah is not only central to Christian theology but is also a defining point of difference between Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. The Christian case draws on a rich tapestry of prophecy, apostolic testimony, and theological reflection, asserting that the fullness of God is revealed in Christ. Jewish and Islamic scholarship, as well as secular critical scholarship, challenge these readings on exegetical, theological, and historical grounds.For the serious seeker, the issue invites further study, honest engagement with sources, and respect for the mystery at the heart of the world’s great monotheistic traditions.FootnotesAdele Berlin and Marc Zvi Brettler, eds.,The Jewish Study Bible(Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004), on Isaiah 7:14.Rashi and Ibn Ezra, commentaries on Isaiah 9:6, inThe Tanakh: The Holy Scriptures(Philadelphia: JPS, 1985).Michael Fishbane,The JPS Bible Commentary: Haftarot(Philadelphia: JPS, 2002), on Micah 5:2.Geza Vermes,Jesus the Jew(Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1973), 37–51; James Kugel,How to Read the Bible(New York: Free Press, 2007), 669–710.Larry W.

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteTHE SIJIDA (PROSTRATION) OF MUSLIMS AS THE MARK OF THE ANTICHRIST: EVIDENCE FROM BIBLICAL FOREHEAD PROPHECYThe act of prostration, orsijida, observed in Islamic worship, has been identified by some as a visible sign that may correspond to the biblical \"mark of the beast,\" as referenced in the Book of Revelation. According to this perspective, the so-called \"False Prophet\"—a figure described in Christian eschatology—induces people to receive this mark upon their foreheads.The principal biblical passage discussing the \"mark of the beast\" is found in Revelation 13:15-18, while supplementary references include Revelation 14:9, 14:11, 15:2, 16:2, 19:20, and 20:4. This mark operates as a seal upon the followers of the Antichrist and the False Prophet (the spokesman for the Antichrist). The False Prophet is the one who compels people to receive this mark—interpreted here assijida—on their foreheads.The mark of the beast, according to the book of Revelation, will be granted only to those who worship the Antichrist—here identified with Allah, the deity of Islam in this controversial perspective. In the eschatological end-times, this mark will serve as a credential or permit, without which no one may buy or sell (cf. the advent ofIslamic bankingsystems). Only those who worship the Antichrist—that is, Muslims—will receive it.Notably, the False Prophet is described as the one who compels the followers of Allah to take this mark. Importantly, this mark is placed on the forehead, not carried as a card or physical token. The pertinent question then arises: which prophet and which religion bear this mark ofsijida?Shalom,Maxwell Shimba, servant of Jesus ChristScholarly and Theological Expansion1.Biblical Forehead Prophecy: Scriptural FoundationThe Book of Revelation is replete with apocalyptic imagery and symbolism, none more contested or discussed than the “mark of the beast” (Greek:charagma tou thēriou). Revelation 13:16-17 reads:\"And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.\" (NKJV)The mark, placed upon theforehead, functions as a visible identifier, denoting allegiance to the beast—a figure widely recognized in Christian eschatology as the Antichrist. Other passages reinforce this theme (see Revelation 14:9-11, 15:2, 16:2, 19:20, and 20:4). Theologically, the forehead symbolizes the mind, will, and open allegiance; it is the seat of identity and devotion (cf. Deuteronomy 6:8).2.Historical and Comparative Religious ContextThe practice of prostration in prayer (sijida) is integral to Islamic worship. During thesalah, Muslims touch their foreheads to the ground, often resulting in a visible callous or mark (zabiba) on the forehead, regarded by some as a sign of devoutness.In comparative religious studies, physical markers of religious allegiance—such astefillinin Judaism or thesign of the crossin Christianity—function symbolically to demarcate the faithful. However, in Revelation, the mark is specifically tied to eschatological apostasy and false worship.3.Theological Interpretation: The Mark as Eschatological AllegianceWithin Christian eschatology, particularly in dispensational and futurist readings, the mark on the forehead is not merely literal but spiritual—a public, visible, and embodied loyalty to the Antichrist. Scholarly debate abounds regarding the nature of this mark: is it a literal implant, a symbol, or a public religious act?The identification of Islamicsijidawith the biblical mark is a controversial interpretation advanced by some Christian polemicists. Proponents argue:The act of touching the forehead to the ground in allegiance to a non-Christian deity constitutes the visible “mark” of rebellion against Christ.The growing prominence of Islamic finance (Islamic banking), which aligns with religious law, prefigures the economic dimension of the prophecy—where commerce is contingent upon religious allegiance.However, other scholars caution against conflating scriptural prophecy with contemporary religious practices, emphasizing the dangers of supersessionism and religious stereotyping (see Craig Koester,Revelation and the End of All Things, 2018).4.Academic and Interfaith Dialogue: Spectrum of ViewsIn academic discourse, interpretations of Revelation range widely:Evangelical and Dispensationalistwriters often literalize the mark, viewing it as a future physical or technological identifier (e.g., RFID chips).Historico-criticalscholars, such as Elaine Pagels, interpret the mark symbolically as participation in the imperial cult or societal conformity (Pagels,Revelations: Visions, Prophecy, and Politics in the Book of Revelation, 2012).Islamic scholarshiprejects all connections between Islamic practice and Antichrist prophecy, emphasizing the monotheistic continuity of Islam with Abrahamic faiths (see Seyyed Hossein Nasr,Islam: Religion, History, and Civilization, 2003).5.Conclusion: The Forehead Mark—A Prophetic WarningWhile the direct identification of Muslimsijidaas the \"mark of the beast\" remains controversial and debated, the symbolism of the forehead in biblical prophecy remains clear: it is the locus of public allegiance, identity, and worship. Christians are warned to guard their minds and allegiance, resisting false prophets and counterfeit worship (cf. 2 Thessalonians 2:3-4).References & FootnotesKoester, Craig R.Revelation and the End of All Things.

They only need to believe that God exists, that there will be a Day when He will resurrect and judge humanity (\"the Last Day\"), and to do what is right.Yet this directly contradicts other statements which say that Islam is the only religion accepted and even speaks against embracing the faiths of Judaism and Christianity!\"And they say, 'None will enter Paradise except one who is a Jew or a Christian.' These are their wishful thinking. Say, [O Muhammad], 'Produce your proof, if you should be truthful.' Yes, [on the contrary], whoever submits his face in Islam to Allah while being a doer of good will have his reward with his Lord. And no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve...\" [See Tafsir Ibn Kathir, Vol.1, Page 154]. \"The Jews say the Christians follow nothing [true]; and the Christians say the Jews follow nothing [true]; though both recite the Scripture. Thus the polytheists speak the same as they do. But Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ.\" (Qur'an 2:111-113)\"Indeed, the religion in the sight of Allah is Islam. And those who were given the Scripture did not differ except after knowledge had come to them—out of jealous animosity between themselves. And whoever disbelieves in the verses of Allah, then indeed, Allah is swift in [taking] account.\" (Qur'an 3:19)\"Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was one inclining toward truth, a Muslim [submitting to Allah]. And he was not of the polytheists.\" (Qur'an 3:67)\"So is it other than the religion of Allah they desire, while to Him have submitted [all] those within the heavens and earth, willingly or by compulsion, and to Him they will be returned? Say, 'We have believed in Allah and in what was revealed to us and what was revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Descendants [Al-Asbat], and in what was given to Moses and Jesus and to the prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and to Him we have submitted [in Islam].' And whoever desires other than Islam as religion—never will it be accepted from him, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers.\" (Qur'an 3:83-85)\"...This day those who disbelieve have despaired of [defeating] your religion; so fear them not, but fear Me. This day I have perfected for you your religion and completed My favor upon you and have approved for you Islam as religion...\" (Qur'an 5:3)Moreover, the Quran says that Jews and Christians are condemned for believing in the divinity of God's messengers like Jesus and Ezra:\"They have certainly disbelieved who say, 'Allah is the Messiah, the son of Mary.' But the Messiah said, 'O Children of Israel, worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.' Indeed, he who associates others with Allah—Allah has forbidden him Paradise, and his refuge is the Fire. And there are not for the wrongdoers any helpers. They have certainly disbelieved who say, 'Allah is the third of three.' And there is no god except one God. And if they do not desist from what they are saying, there will surely afflict the disbelievers among them a painful punishment.\" (Qur'an 5:72-73)\"The Jews say, 'Ezra is the son of Allah'; and the Christians say, 'The Messiah is the son of Allah.' That is their statement from their mouths; they imitate the saying of those who disbelieved [before them]. May Allah destroy them; how are they deluded?\" (Qur'an 9:30)Given the above, how can the Quran promise Jews and Christians a reward from their Lord for believing and doing good while they are not Muslims and hold to the divinity of specific messengers?To avoid this problem, some Muslims interpret the word \"Islam\" not as the religion itself, but as a reference to submission, which is its literal meaning. By this understanding, anyone who submits to God is a Muslim, whose path is essentially Islam even if they call themselves Jews or Christians.The main issue with this claim is that this is not how the Quran defines Islam—as merely general submission—but as a religion distinct from Judaism and Christianity, as Q. 2:111 and 3:67 show. It is even specifically introduced as a religion in Q. 3:19 and 83-85.Indeed, the Quran claims that the name Muslim was given to prophets long before Muhammad:\"And strive for Allah with the striving due to Him. He has chosen you and has not placed upon you in the religion any difficulty. [It is] the religion of your father, Abraham. Allah named you Muslims before [in former scriptures] and in this [revelation] that the Messenger may be a witness over you and you may be witnesses over the people. So establish prayer and give zakah and hold fast to Allah. He is your protector; and excellent is the protector, and excellent is the helper.\" (Qur'an 22:78)This is how some early Muslim commentators explained these writings:\"(He has named you Muslims before and in this [Qur'an])\"Narrated by Imam Abdullah bin Al-Mubarak from Ibn Jurayj, from ‘Ata’ from Ibn Abbas regarding Allah’s saying...\"(He named you Muslims before)\"\"This refers to Allah, exalted is He.\" This was also the opinion of Mujahid, `Ata', Ad-Dahhak, As-Suddi, Muqatil bin Hayyan, and Qatadah. Mujahid said: \"Allah named you Muslims before, in the previous scriptures and in Adh-Dhikr [the reminder, the Quran].\"For more detail, see: [Tafsir Ibn Kathir (Abridged), Surah Al-Isra’ 39 to the end of Surah Al-Mu’minun, summarized by a group of scholars under Shaykh Safiur-Rahman Al-Mubarakpuri [Darussalam, Riyadh, Houston, New York, Lahore; First Edition: July 2000], Vol. 6, pp. 625-626; emphasis added]So, the Quran teaches that even before Muhammad, the prophets and believers were called \"Muslims\"! In other words, their religion was not Judaism or Christianity but Islam, and that is why they were called Muslims. This also explains why Q. 3:67 calls Abraham a Muslim and shows that the Quran does not define \"Islam\" in merely a general sense, such that anyone who submits to God is, in fact, a Muslim regardless of whether he calls himself a Jew, Christian, Hindu, etc. For more on this, see:http://answering-islam.org/Quran/Contra/muslims_before.htmOthers may argue that the Quran is only referring to those Jews and Christians who affirm the absolute oneness of God, or the Islamic concept of tawhid, and not those who embrace the divinity of prophets such as Jesus. The problem with this claim is that these verses do not provide such a qualification, i.e., that only those Jews and Christians who believe in Islamic tawhid will receive a reward from their Lord. Furthermore, it is a matter of historical record that Orthodox Jews and Christians uphold the unity of God, despite Muslims’ dissatisfaction with those groups' doctrine of God and their criticism of such teachings as the Christian Trinity.Moreover, the Quran warns against accepting only some prophets and books of Allah, and rejecting others:\"Then is it only a part of the Scripture that you believe in, and do you disbelieve in the rest? Then what is the recompense of those who do so among you except disgrace in worldly life; and on the Day of Resurrection they will be sent back to the severest torment. And Allah is not unaware of what you do.\" (Qur'an 2:85)\"Indeed, those who disbelieve in Allah and His messengers and wish to discriminate between Allah and His messengers and say, 'We believe in some and disbelieve in others,' and wish to adopt a way in between—\" (Qur'an 4:150)Historically, the Jewish religion has rejected John the Baptist, Jesus Christ, and Muhammad as messengers from God, while Christianity rejects Muhammad as a true prophet/messenger. Furthermore, Jews do not accept the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ or the Quran, just as Christians reject the Quran as revelation. So how can people remain in these religions without violating the earlier Quranic statements? And how can God promise that such people have nothing to fear but will receive a reward from Him?Furthermore, by rejecting some prophets and books, such people have become unbelievers (kuffar). The Quran emphatically says that Allah will not accept the good deeds of unbelievers:\"It is not for the polytheists to maintain the mosques of Allah while witnessing against themselves with disbelief. For such their deeds have become worthless, and in the Fire shall they abide.\" (Qur'an 9:17)\"[Their situation] is like those before you: they were mightier than you in power and more abundant in wealth and children. They had their share [of enjoyment] in their portion, so you have enjoyed your share as those before you enjoyed their share; and you have engaged in vanities as they engaged in vanities. It is those whose deeds have become worthless in this world and in the Hereafter, and it is they who are the losers.\" (Qur'an 9:69)\"They will say, 'Did there not come to you your messengers with clear proofs?' They will say, 'Yes.' They will reply, 'Then supplicate [yourselves], but the supplication of the disbelievers is nothing but in vain.'\" (Qur'an 40:50)Again, how can one remain a Jew or Christian and have their righteous deeds accepted while rejecting some of the prophets and scriptures which the Quran says must be fully embraced and believed?All quotations taken from the Hilali-Khan translation of the Quran.Shalom,Dr. Maxwell Shimba for Max Shimba Ministries",

A Christian, who may not know any better, quickly responds, “Wa'alaykum Salaam,” believing wholeheartedly that they have received a greeting identical to the one Muslims exchange amongst themselves, namely, “Assalaam aleykum” (السلام عليكم), which means “May the peace of Allah be upon you.”My fellow Christian, understand that a Muslim, knowing you are a Christian, will never greet you with “Assalaam Aleykum”—that is, wishing you the peace of the god they worship. Instead, the Muslim will greet a Christian by saying:Sam Aleykum(سم عليكم), meaning in Swahili, “Death be upon you.” When addressing several Christians, this is the form used.If addressing a single Christian, they will say,Sam Alaika(سم عليك), meaning “Death be upon you.”Unaware, the Christian happily responds, thinking a good greeting has been given, when in fact, a curse has been pronounced (“You deserve death...”).Therefore, from today, when you are greeted by a Muslim with “Sam aleykum,” respond by saying:Wa ‘alaykum Faqatu(عليكم فقة), meaning, “May that death return to you.”Even if the greeting given is the standard “Assalaam aleykum” (meaning “peace of Allah be upon you”), do not respond in kind, because the peace Muslims offer (that of the world) is different from the peace Jesus gave to His disciples, when He said:Salaamu'n Lakum(سلام لكم), meaning “Peace be upon you.”There is a difference between the “salaam” of Jesus and that of Muslims. Jesus said:“Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives.” (John 14:27)Therefore,be very cautious with their greetings.Theological and Academic ExpansionBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological Institute1.Historical Background and Linguistic AnalysisThe act of greeting in Semitic cultures, both ancient and modern, holds significant spiritual and social weight. The phrase“Assalaam aleykum”(peace be upon you) is derived from the Arabic rootslm, meaning “peace.” Historically, both Jews and Christians from the Middle Eastern region have used similar greetings—shalom aleichemin Hebrew, andsalaam alaykumin Arabic.However, the claim that Muslims intentionally use “Sam aleykum” or “Sam alaika” (interpreted as “death be upon you”) when greeting non-Muslims is controversial and debated among scholars. Linguistically, “Sam” (سم) can mean “poison” or “death” in Arabic, but in everyday Muslim practice, the standard greeting, even towards non-Muslims, remains “Assalaam aleykum.” Academic sources, includingLane’s Arabic-English Lexicon, affirm this.TheHadithliterature does mention incidents in which enemies of the Prophet Muhammad would substitute “Sam” for “Salaam” as a form of mockery or curse (seeSahih Bukhari, Book 56, Hadith 759). In response, Muhammad advised his followers simply to respond, “Wa ‘alaykum” (“And upon you”). However, the teaching and mainstream practice among Muslims worldwide is to use “Assalaam aleykum” as a greeting of peace, and there is no universal doctrine promoting the curse form towards Christians.2.Theological Comparison: The Peace of Christ vs. Worldly PeaceJesus’ teaching on peace is distinctively spiritual. InJohn 14:27, Jesus declares:“Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives.”The peace of Christ (eirenein Greek,shalomin Hebrew) is not simply the absence of conflict or a polite social exchange. It is an inner, abiding peace with God, rooted in reconciliation through Christ’s sacrificial work. It is unconditional, transcendent, and not dependent on outward circumstances.The greeting “Assalaam aleykum” is, in Islamic theology, a supplication for safety, wellness, and harmony, but its theological center is different from that of Christianity. For Muslims, peace is a social, communal value but is tied to submission (Islam) to Allah’s will. For Christians, peace is the gift of the indwelling Holy Spirit, a fruit of salvation (seeRomans 5:1, Galatians 5:22).3.Missiological and Social ImplicationsA. Discernment in GreetingsChristians are called to discernment (1 John 4:1), especially regarding spiritual matters. While cultural sensitivity and courtesy are commendable, Christians must understand the origins and intentions of spiritual practices. However, accusations or suspicion without evidence can breed unnecessary hostility.B. Responding to Greetings BiblicallyJesus taught His followers to bless even those who curse them (Luke 6:28). The early Christians were taught, “If someone wishes you peace, let your peace return to them” (Matthew 10:12-13). Thus, the Christian response to greetings—even from those of other faiths—should reflect the spirit of Christ: grace, truth, and love.4.Academic Perspective: Interfaith RelationsAcademically, it is important to approach such claims with critical investigation. While polemical writings have historically exaggerated or misinterpreted Muslim practices, primary sources do not support the view that Muslims systematically curse Christians in greetings. Interfaith dialogue and scholarship emphasize mutual respect and the promotion of peace (seeEsposito, “Islam: The Straight Path,” Oxford, 2021).5.Conclusion: The Christian DistinctiveChristians are ambassadors of Christ’s peace (2 Corinthians 5:20). The peace offered by Jesus is not simply a formulaic phrase but a living reality, distinguishing Christian life from religious formalism. While Christians should exercise discernment, they must also exemplify the love and peace of Christ, even in their responses to greetings from people of other faiths.“Let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to answer everyone.” (Colossians 4:6)Footnotes:Lane, E.W.An Arabic-English Lexicon.

How could he forgive someone else’s sins?MUHAMMAD ASKED FOR FORGIVENESS ONE HUNDRED TIMES A DAY:In “Sahih Muslim, Book 35, Hadith 6522,” it says that the Prophet Muhammad was so sinful that he would ask Allah for forgiveness a hundred times every day.Quote:“Today is today, whoever says tomorrow is a liar.”My brothers and sisters, the more I study Islam, the more doubts I have, because there is nothing good at all in this religion of Muhammad and Jibril (Gabriel).

In Muhammad’s case, this is difficult because the Qur’an says that he is an example in his life and actions:So, how could Muhammad have a shadow over his heart?How did he get this distress while he was supposedly receiving revelation from Allah?Is it possible that this revelation was itself the source of the distress filling his heart?Qur’an 68:4:\"Your life and your deeds are [an example].\" (Mohammed Knut Bernstöm, Qur’an)All people have sinnedThe Bible says that all people have sinned. This includes the Prophet Muhammad—he was sinful like everyone else, but Muhammad himself admitted that his sins were not forgiven even though he asked for forgiveness a hundred times a day.Dear reader, why should we follow or listen to Muhammad, who admitted that his sins were not forgiven?Why did Allah fail to forgive Muhammad’s sins?Does Allah have the power to forgive sins?Muhammad is the only prophet who died with sin, and the wages of sin is death in Hell. Romans 6:23:“For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.”Because the sinner is condemned to death. “For the wages of sin is death” (Romans 6:23).This means separation from God in Hell forever. “Just as people are destined to die once, and after that to face judgment” (Hebrews 9:27).Therefore, why die in your sins like Muhammad and be separated from God in Hell?My friend:I ask you the most important question of your life. Your eternal joy or eternal sorrow depends on the answer to this question.

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionWithin Islamic theology, the Quran is venerated as the final, unaltered, and most complete revelation from God. Muslims assert that it is a“muhaymin”(guardian or confirmer) over previous scriptures (Quran 5:48). However, a critical and scholarly examination reveals significant gaps in the Quran’s content—particularly regarding foundational narratives, historical details, and doctrinal essentials that are indispensable for any comprehensive religious worldview. This raises profound theological questions:If the Quran is indeed complete and final, why do Muslims recurrently resort to the Bible to supplement their beliefs?What are the implications for the coherence and sufficiency of Islamic doctrine?I. The Missing Foundations: What the Quran Leaves UnansweredThe Quran, while referencing many biblical figures and events, is notoriously silent on fundamental details that are explicitly found in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) and the New Testament. Consider the following:Identity and Lineage:The Quran mentions Adam, but does not name his wife (Eve). It speaks of Abraham, but omits the number and names of his sons, only emphasizing Ishmael and Isaac. It references Jacob, but never lists the names of his twelve sons—the patriarchs of the tribes of Israel.The Ten Commandments:Nowhere in the Quran is the Decalogue, the list of Ten Commandments, given as a unit. Although fragments of the ethical code appear, the unique and formative role of the Decalogue in religious history is missing.Historical Narratives:The exile of Israel to Babylon, the experiences of Daniel, the return from exile, and many prophetic narratives are alluded to but left almost entirely unexplained or omitted in the Quranic text.The Gospel Message:The Quran commands belief in the “Injil” (Gospel) given to Jesus, but fails to preserve or articulate the content of this message. It neither recounts the Sermon on the Mount nor the parables and teachings central to Christian faith.These are not minor omissions—they are foundational to understanding God’s unfolding plan, the nature of humanity, the covenant, and the requirements of divine law.II. Theological Implications: The Necessity of the Bible in Islamic ThoughtGiven these omissions, Islamic scholarship has long relied on“Isra’iliyyat”—Jewish and Christian traditions—to fill gaps in Quranic narratives. Classic tafsir (Quranic exegesis), such as those by Ibn Kathir and Al-Tabari, are replete with references to Biblical material. This raises a theological crisis:The Quran’s Claim to Completeness:The Quran repeatedly claims to be“a clarification of all things”(Quran 16:89) and“perfected”(Quran 5:3). Yet, its dependence on earlier revelation for context and content contradicts this claim. If the Quran is truly self-sufficient, why is recourse to the Bible necessary, either for exegesis or basic religious knowledge?The Doctrine of Tahrif (Corruption):Muslims often claim that the Bible has been corrupted (tahrif), yet continually turn to it for clarification of stories and doctrines that the Quran leaves ambiguous or unexplained. This reliance is both inconsistent and self-defeating: If the Bible is corrupt, its testimony should be irrelevant. If it is needed, then the Quran is incomplete without it.III. The Quran as a Dependent Text: Evidence from Islamic PracticeThroughout Islamic history, the practice of borrowing from the Bible is ubiquitous. Whether discussing the lives of the prophets, the creation narrative, or the moral law, Islamic tradition continually seeks validation and completion from the Bible.Examples:The Names of the Prophets’ Wives and Children:In every major Islamic commentary, details absent from the Quran are imported from Genesis, Exodus, and other biblical books.The Structure of Sharia:Islamic law incorporates elements of Mosaic law, including rituals, dietary rules, and penal codes—all originally expounded in the Torah, not the Quran.Eschatology and Christology:Concepts such as the Messiah, the Day of Judgment, and the final resurrection are understood in light of New Testament teaching, not by Quranic exposition alone.IV. Theological and Logical Consequences1.Sufficiency and Finality Challenged:The Quran cannot, by itself, answer the basic questions of faith, history, and doctrine. If a “final revelation” is truly final, it should not require constant supplementation from a previous, supposedly obsolete, or corrupted text.2.Epistemological Insecurity:Muslims face a dilemma: either trust the Bible and undermine their doctrine of tahrif, or reject it and remain without answers to crucial religious questions.3.Christological Vacuum:The Quran’s affirmation of Jesus as Messiah (Quran 3:45; 4:171) is left theologically empty unless interpreted through the New Testament, which the Quran does not preserve or explain.V. Conclusion: Why We Need the Bible—And Why the Quran Alone Is InadequateIn summary, the Quran’s self-declared sufficiency is theologically and textually untenable. Its silence on essential issues leaves Islam dependent upon the very Bible it claims to supersede. Thus, the Bible remains indispensable—not only for Christians and Jews but for any honest seeker who desires to understand the very roots of the Quranic narrative.If the Quran were the only book of God, religious knowledge and salvation history would be irreparably impoverished. The reliance of Islam on the Bible is both unavoidable and fatal to its claim of scriptural finality. The Bible is needed for everything; the Quran, without the Bible, is left with nothing but unanswered questions.ReferencesQuran 16:89– “And We have sent down to you the Book as clarification for all things…”Quran 5:3– “This day I have perfected for you your religion…”Ibn Kathir,Tafsir al-Qur’an al-Azim(exegesis using biblical material)Al-Tabari,Jami’ al-Bayan(reliance on “Isra’iliyyat”)Bible, Genesis 1-50; Exodus 1-40; Matthew, Mark, Luke, John.Dr. Maxwell Shimba,Shimba Theological Institute",

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionAmong the more curious features of classical Islamic exegesis is the tradition concerning the procreation of Satan (Iblis) and the divine orchestration behind it. This narrative, found in works such as Tafsir Al-Qurtubi on Q18:50, presents Satan as a being created by Allah with both male and female sexual organs, capable of self-propagation and the continual spawning of demonic offspring. This article undertakes a critical, theological, and scholarly examination of this tradition, interrogating its sources, logic, and implications for Islamic theodicy and divine purpose.The Narrative in Question: Source and ContentAccording to Tafsir al-Qurtubi on Qur’an 18:50:Mujahid said:“Satan inserted his male private part into his female private part and laid five eggs, this is the origin of his offspring.”Another report states:“Allah created for him a male private part in his right thigh and a female private part in his left thigh. Satan has sexual intercourse (using these organs), lays 10 eggs every day, and from each egg 70 devils are born.”Such narrations are echoed by other classical scholars (e.g., Al-Tabari, Al-Kalbi, Ibn Kathir) and find resonance in various hadith and folkloric traditions, despite not being mentioned explicitly in the Qur’an itself.The Theological Problem: Why Did Allah Create Satan’s Procreative Power?1.Purpose and Divine WisdomThe first and most fundamental question is:Why would Allah, described as All-Wise (Al-Hakim), All-Knowing (Al-‘Alim), and the Most Merciful (Ar-Rahman), purposefully create within Satan the biological capacity for self-propagation?If Satan’s sole role is to mislead humanity and rebel against the divine, does the provision of a sexual apparatus and the subsequent multiplication of devils serve any redemptive, just, or wise end?a.Theodicy and the Problem of EvilIslamic theodicy argues that all things Allah creates are ultimately for good, even if their immediate effects appear evil. But the creation of thousands of new devils daily, whose existence serves to increase evil, temptation, and suffering, seems contrary to the divine attributes of mercy and justice.b.Comparison with Christian TheologyIn Christian theology, Satan is not depicted as self-propagating or laying eggs. The demonic realm consists of fallen angels—unique creations—without the concept of sexual reproduction or endless demonic multiplication. This avoids the implication that God is continuously manufacturing evil entities.2.Textual Authenticity and Intellectual Coherencea.Scriptural SilenceThe Qur’an itself never states that Satan self-propagates by laying eggs or through sexual intercourse. This doctrine emerges from extraneous tafsir and weak or fabricated hadiths, raising questions about its canonical status.b.Anthropomorphism and MythologyThe description of Satan’s anatomy and procreation borrows heavily from ancient Near Eastern mythologies and anthropomorphic imaginations. It brings the divine creative act to the level of fable, blurring the lines between theology and folklore.3.Quantifying Satan’s Offspring: How Many?If, as claimed, Satan lays 10 eggs per day and from each egg 70 devils are born, then:10 eggs × 70 devils = 700 devils/dayIn one year: 700 × 365 = 255,500 devilsOver 1,400 years (since Islam’s advent): 255,500 × 1,400 ≈ 357,700,000 devilsThese numbers become absurd when extended to the scale of world history, raising further theological and rational dilemmas.4.The Challenge to Islamic Thought: What is the Benefit?a.Divine Intention vs. Satanic AutonomyIf Allah intentionally created Satan’s procreative ability, then the proliferation of devils is adirectresult of divine will, not merely the outcome of Satan’s rebellion. Does this implicate Allah in the proliferation of evil? What possible divine benefit or wisdom could justify the ongoing creation of more and more devils?b.Human Accountability and JusticeIf humans are held responsible for succumbing to satanic temptation, while Allah simultaneously increases the number of tempters, can divine justice be maintained? Does this not create an imbalance where the test of faith is perpetually stacked against humanity?5.A Call for Re-examinationIslamic theologians must grapple with the narrative’s origins and implications. A doctrine that places the multiplication of evil within the creative prerogative of Allah calls into question divine justice, mercy, and wisdom. Unless this narrative is rejected as folkloric, Islam faces a profound theological challenge:What conceivable benefit or higher wisdom is served by the exponential, daily increase of Satan’s offspring?ConclusionThe account of Satan’s sexual self-propagation, as recorded in Tafsir al-Qurtubi and echoed in other classical sources, exposes a significant theological tension within Islam. The lack of clear Qur’anic basis, the problematic implications for theodicy and justice, and the anthropomorphic absurdity of the narrative together demand a critical scholarly response.Islamic scholars are challenged to either provide a coherent, divinely beneficial explanation for this doctrine or, alternatively, to repudiate it as a mythological accretion unworthy of divine revelation.Such re-examination is essential not only for the internal coherence of Islamic theology but also for its credibility in dialogue with other world religions and rational inquiry.Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteReferences:Al-Qurtubi,Tafsir al-Qurtubi, commentary on Q18:50.Al-Tabari,Tafsir al-Tabari.Ibn Kathir,Tafsir Ibn Kathir.Watt, W.

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThe manner in which a religious tradition instructs its adherents to treat enemies is a powerful indicator of its divine or human origins. In particular, the ethical directives of Jesus Christ regarding love for enemies stand in stark contrast to the martial injunctions found in the Quran. This article presents a theological critique of Islam’s claim to divine origin, focusing especially onSurah 9:14(Q9:14) and its implications, while contrasting these with the teachings of Jesus as preserved in the New Testament. The conclusion is drawn that Allah, as depicted in the Quran, is not the God of the Bible, and therefore the prophets and apostles before Muhammad were not Muslims.1. The Biblical Ethic of Enemy LoveOne of the hallmarks of the New Testament is Jesus’ radical command tolove one’s enemies. As recorded in Matthew 5:44, Jesus declares, “But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.”1 This theme is reiterated throughout the New Testament and has its antecedents in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament):Luke 6:27-28: “But I say to you who hear, Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you.”2Proverbs 25:21-22: “If your enemy is hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he is thirsty, give him water to drink, for you will heap burning coals on his head, and the Lord will reward you.”3Romans 12:20: “If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink; for by so doing you will heap burning coals on his head.”4These teachings reflect the essential nature of God as “merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness.”5 The ethic of enemy love is not marginal, but central to the Christian revelation, culminating in Christ’s self-sacrificial death for sinners and enemies alike (Romans 5:8).62. The Quranic Ethic: Surah 9:14 and Divine ViolenceIn contrast, the Quran repeatedly sanctions violent struggle against non-believers, particularly in the Medinan surahs.Surah 9:14reads:“Fight them; Allah will punish them by your hands and will disgrace them and give you victory over them and satisfy the breasts of a believing people.”7All major English translations render the message similarly, authorizing fighting, punishment, humiliation, and the satisfaction of the believing community.8 The exegetical tradition (tafsir) reinforces this interpretation. Ibn Kathir, for example, comments that this verse means Allah “will punish them at your hands, you are the ones who will inflict punishment upon them.”9 The message is echoed throughout other surahs (Q2:190-193; Q8:12-13; Q9:5, 29), establishing a pattern that stands at odds with the radical nonviolence of Jesus.10Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) historically codified these commands into laws concerning jihad (offensive and defensive war), as attested by classical scholars such as al-Tabari and al-Mawardi.11 Attempts by modern apologists to recontextualize these verses do not erase the traditional, literal understanding embedded in both Sunni and Shia orthodoxy.123. Allah and the God of the Bible: Theological IncompatibilityA. God as FatherThe Bible reveals God as Father—a personal, relational deity (Matthew 6:9; Romans 8:15).13 The Quran, in contrast, emphatically denies God’s fatherhood (Q5:18; Q6:101; Q19:88-93).14 This theological distinction is foundational.B. God as LoveWhile the Bible asserts that “God is love” (1 John 4:8, 16), the Quran never makes this ontological claim about Allah. Allah is described as “the Loving” (al-Wadud; Q11:90, Q85:14), but love is not presented as His essence.15C. God Incarnate in ChristChristianity proclaims that God was incarnate in Jesus Christ (John 1:1-18; Colossians 2:9). The Quran explicitly rejects the divinity and crucifixion of Christ (Q4:157-158).16 Therefore, the God revealed in Jesus is not the Allah described in the Quran.4. The Prophets and Apostles: Not Muslims, Not Proclaimers of IslamThe claim that the biblical prophets and apostles were Muslims collapses under both historical and textual scrutiny:TheHebrew prophetsandNew Testament apostlesnever professed faith in the Qur’anic Allah or recited the shahada.17Theethical frameworkof the Hebrew Bible, while containing accounts of divinely sanctioned war, never commands perpetual violence against all non-believers. These wars were judicial, historically circumscribed, and ultimately aimed at redemption.18TheNew Covenantinaugurated by Jesus is defined by reconciliation, peacemaking, and the abolition of ethnic, cultural, and religious hostilities (Ephesians 2:14-16; Galatians 3:28).195. Conclusion: Islam as a Contradiction of Divine RevelationThe Qur’anic teaching to “fight them… punish them by your hands… disgrace them” (Q9:14) is incompatible with the divine ethic of enemy love that Jesus proclaimed. The true measure of divine revelation is the perfection of love, mercy, and forgiveness—attributes uniquely revealed in the triune God of the Bible.20 Thus, Allah of the Quran is not the same as the God of the Bible, and Islam cannot be the final or true revelation from the God of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Jesus.Endnote:The invitation stands for all to come to Jesus Christ, who alone reveals the heart of God, brings peace, and heals the wounds of both friend and enemy.FootnotesMatthew 5:44, English Standard Version (ESV).Luke 6:27-28, ESV.Proverbs 25:21-22, ESV.Romans 12:20, ESV.Exodus 34:6, ESV.Romans 5:8, ESV; cf.

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThe question of Jesus Christ's divinity occupies a central position in Christian theology and is a point of contention in Muslim-Christian dialogues. While Islamic sources—namely the Qur’an, Allah, Muhammad, and Jibril—deny Jesus' divinity, their very testimonies, when examined carefully, inadvertently affirm attributes that, according to both scriptural traditions, belong to God alone. Among these is the authority to forgive sins, an act that is foundationally and uniquely reserved for God. This article will critically examine this attribute and its Christological implications through a comparative theological lens, employing both biblical and Qur’anic texts.The Authority to Forgive Sins: A Divine PrerogativeThe Qur’an explicitly declares that forgiveness of sins is the exclusive right of God. In Surah Ghafir (40:2-3), it is written:\"The revelation of the Book is from Allah, the Exalted in Power, the All-Knowing. The Forgiver of sin, Acceptor of repentance, Severe in punishment, Owner of abundance. There is no deity except Him; to Him is the final return.\"Here, the Qur’an affirms that only God can forgive sins. This divine prerogative, as understood in Islamic theology, is beyond the scope of any human agent.In parallel, the Gospel narrative presents an episode where Jesus explicitly exercises the authority to forgive sins, thereby eliciting accusations of blasphemy from the religious authorities of His time. In Mark 2:5-11, the text recounts:\"When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, 'Son, your sins are forgiven.' Now some of the scribes were sitting there, questioning in their hearts, 'Why does this man speak like that? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?' And immediately Jesus, perceiving in His spirit that they thus questioned within themselves, said to them, 'Why do you question these things in your hearts? Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, \"Your sins are forgiven,\" or to say, \"Rise, take up your bed and walk\"? But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins'—He said to the paralytic—'I say to you, rise, pick up your bed, and go home.'\"This narrative is not merely an account of healing but a profound theological assertion of divine identity. Jesus’ forgiveness of sins, an act understood even by His opponents as uniquely divine, serves as a direct demonstration of His divinity.The Incarnation: Concealing the Majesty of the DivineA common objection to Christ’s divinity arises from His humanity—His hunger, fatigue, sorrow, and mortality. Critics argue that the assumption of human nature diminishes His divine authority. However, Christian theology holds that the incarnation does not diminish but rather veils divine majesty for the purpose of redemptive accessibility.This principle is not foreign to the biblical narrative. In Exodus 19:20-21 and Exodus 33:18, 20, God reveals Himself in ways that are both awesome and perilous to humanity, underscoring the necessity of mediation for the sake of human survival:\"You cannot see My face, for man shall not see Me and live.\" (Exodus 33:20)Thus, the incarnation is understood as an act of divine accommodation. In the New Testament, this theological reality is affirmed:\"And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen His glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.\" (John 1:14)\"Great indeed, we confess, is the mystery of godliness: He was manifested in the flesh...\" (1 Timothy 3:16)\"When Christ came into the world, He said, 'A body you have prepared for me...'\" (Hebrews 10:5)\"...but emptied Himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men.\" (Philippians 2:7)The incarnation, therefore, is not a subtraction of divinity but the necessary veil (cf. Hebrews 10:20) that allows sinful humanity to approach God without being consumed by His holiness.The Title \"Son of God\" and Its Ontological ImplicationsThe designation \"Son of God\" has often been misconstrued as implying inferiority or created status. However, the term arises from the act of incarnation—the eternal Word taking on human nature. John 1:14 asserts:\"And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen His glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father...\"This is not a change in essence but a change in role or manifestation, akin to water taking the form of ice: the substance remains the same, though the form is adapted for a particular purpose. Thus, Jesus as the \"Son\" is the incarnate manifestation of the eternal divine nature, His humanity serving as the redemptive \"veil\" (cf. Hebrews 10:20).Affirmations of Christ's Deity in Christian ScriptureThe New Testament repeatedly affirms the divinity of Jesus:\"Whoever has seen me has seen the Father.\" (John 14:7-10)\"…our great God and Savior Jesus Christ.\" (Titus 2:13)\"Thomas answered Him, 'My Lord and my God!'\" (John 20:28)These declarations are not metaphorical but ontological, directly ascribing the nature and identity of God to Jesus Christ.Conclusion: The Exclusivity of Christ’s Salvific RoleGiven the evidence from both Christian and Islamic texts, the case for the divinity of Jesus is compelling when viewed through the lens of His unique prerogative to forgive sins and the necessity of the incarnation for human salvation. Scripture attests:\"And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.\" (Acts 4:12)Thus, Christian doctrine maintains that Jesus Christ is fully God and fully man—the only mediator and Savior for humanity.May God bless you as you seek to understand and embrace the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ as revealed in Scripture.Dr. Maxwell ShimbaFor Shimba Theological InstituteCopyright © 2016 Max Shimba Ministries Org.

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThe question of divine authenticity between Christianity and Islam is one that has shaped theological discourse for centuries. At its core, this question is not about the existence of religion, but about the revelation and nature of God. According to biblical theology, God’s desire has always been for a relationship with humanity, not the establishment of a man-made religion. The Bible records God’s initiative to reconcile creation to Himself, while Islam—despite its claims—presents a framework fundamentally at odds with the revealed character of God. This article explores why Christianity, and not Islam, is consistent with the essence and self-disclosure of the Almighty God.I. God’s Essence: Relationship, Not ReligionA. God’s Desire for RelationshipFrom the opening chapters of Genesis, the Bible reveals that God’s primary intention is relational, not ritualistic or religious. Adam and Eve walked with God in the garden (Genesis 3:8), symbolizing intimacy, trust, and direct communion. Even after the Fall, God pursued humanity through covenants and prophetic revelation, culminating in the Incarnation—God becoming flesh in Jesus Christ (John 1:14).Genesis 3:8: “And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day…”Jeremiah 31:33: “…I will be their God, and they shall be my people.”John 17:3: “Now this is eternal life: that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.”B. Religion as Human ConstructContrary to biblical revelation, religion is often the human attempt to reach God through rituals, laws, and systems. The New Testament asserts that it is not through works or religion, but through grace and faith in Christ that reconciliation is achieved (Ephesians 2:8-9).Colossians 2:20-23criticizes “self-imposed religion” and ritualistic observances that lack spiritual power.II. Christianity: The Divine Initiative of ReconciliationChristianity is rooted in God’s self-revelation and initiative. The Torah and the Gospel are unique in that their authenticity was confirmed by God’s own voice from heaven.A. Divine Approval of the Torah and GospelExodus 19:9: “And the LORD said to Moses, ‘Behold, I am coming to you in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you…’”Matthew 17:5: “A voice from the cloud said, ‘This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him!’”These instances show direct divine endorsement—God publicly and audibly affirms the message and messenger. Nowhere in the Quranic tradition is there a parallel event where Allah audibly endorses Muhammad in front of witnesses.B. Reconciliation as the Heart of the Gospel2 Corinthians 5:18-19: “All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation…”Christianity is a message of restoration, forgiveness, and peace with God. The work of Christ is redemptive and reconciling, establishing a relationship—not a religion—between God and man.III. Islam: A Theological and Historical CritiqueA. The Quran’s Content and OrientationUnlike the Bible’s narrative of reconciliation, the Quran repeatedly emphasizes struggle, conflict, and legalistic submission.Quran 9:29: “Fight those who do not believe in Allah…”Quran 8:12: “I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them.”While the Bible calls believers to love even their enemies (Matthew 5:44), the Quran’s primary orientation in many passages is towards conflict and subjugation, not reconciliation.B. Absence of Divine EndorsementNowhere in the Quran or Hadiths does Allah speak audibly to Muhammad in the presence of others, nor does he publicly endorse Muhammad as his messenger, in contrast to the biblical pattern.Quran 42:51: “It is not for any mortal that Allah should speak to him except by revelation or from behind a veil…”The relationship between Allah and Muhammad is one of distance and mediation through the angel Jibril, whereas the biblical God speaks directly and openly to His chosen servants.C. Islam’s Borrowed Narratives and Theological DiscontinuityHistorical and textual criticism shows that much of the Quran’s content borrows from pre-existing Judeo-Christian and apocryphal sources, often with significant alterations and theological distortions (see W. Montgomery Watt, “Muhammad at Mecca”, and Sidney Griffith, “The Bible in Arabic”).Sura 5:46: “And We sent, following in their footsteps, Jesus, the son of Mary, confirming that which came before him in the Torah; and We gave him the Gospel…”Yet, the Quran simultaneously denies key doctrines of the Gospel (e.g., Jesus’ divinity and crucifixion), placing it in theological conflict with its supposed source.IV. Satan, War, and ReconciliationA. The Spirit of Reconciliation vs. WarThe Bible identifies Satan as the originator of conflict, chaos, and destruction (John 8:44; Revelation 12:9). Whenever a religious system is marked by perpetual conflict and absence of true reconciliation, it departs from the spirit and essence of the biblical God.James 3:17-18: “But the wisdom from above is…peaceable, gentle…And a harvest of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.”B. The Fruit of Each MessageChristianity’s message produces reconciliation, love, and peace—signs of God’s kingdom. Islam, in its earliest expansions and in much of its doctrine, produces conquest, division, and religious striving.V. Conclusion: Christianity Alone Aligns with God’s EssenceIn summary, theological and historical evidence demonstrates that Christianity—not Islam—is aligned with the essence, revelation, and intent of Almighty God. Christianity stands upon the public, divine approval of God (Exodus 19:9; Matthew 17:5) and fulfills God’s purpose for relationship and reconciliation, not mere religion.Islam, on the other hand, offers a system of human striving, lacking the audible and public affirmation of God, and diverging from the message of reconciliation. Its historical borrowing, theological contradictions, and spirit of conflict further distance it from the revealed nature of the Almighty God.ReferencesThe Holy Bible, NIVThe QuranW.

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThe doctrine of Christ’s divinity stands as the cornerstone of Christian theology. One of the most profound attributes of divinity, acknowledged across the Abrahamic faiths, is the power of creation. In this scholarly article, I examine both the Quranic and Biblical attestations to Jesus’ creative power, revealing how the unique ascription of creative authority to Jesus in both scriptures is a compelling testament to His divine identity.Allah's Question in the Quran: The Creator vs. the Non-CreatorThe Quran itself raises a profound rhetorical question concerning the distinction between the Creator and those who do not create:Quran 16:17:\"Is then He Who creates like one who does not create? Will you not then take heed?\"Here, Allah challenges the reader: Is it possible to equate the Creator with the created? The Qur'anic context makes clear that the power to create is a defining attribute of God, an exclusive prerogative that distinguishes the Divine from all creatures.Jesus’ Creative Acts in the QuranThe Quran attributes creative acts to Isa (Jesus) that mirror those ascribed to God in the Old Testament:Quran 3:49:\"And [Isa, Jesus] will be a messenger to the Children of Israel, [who will say]: 'Indeed, I have come to you with a sign from your Lord: I will create for you out of clay the likeness of a bird, then I will breathe into it and it will become a bird by Allah’s permission. I heal those born blind and the lepers, and I give life to the dead by Allah’s permission…'\"This passage outlines a series of miracles performed by Jesus:Creating a living bird from clay by breathing into it,Healing the blind and lepers,Raising the dead.It is significant to note that the act of forming a living creature from clay, then imparting life by breath, directly echoes the Genesis creation narrative:Genesis 2:7:\"Then the LORD God formed man of dust from the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being.\"Thus, both the Bible and the Quran attribute the creative act—especially breathing life into clay—as the unique prerogative of God, now performed by Jesus.The Meaning of \"By Allah’s Permission\"Muslim apologists often argue that the phrase \"by Allah’s permission\" (bi-idhni Allah) demotes Jesus to the status of a mere servant or prophet. However, theologically, the concept of \"permission\" or \"authority\" does not negate inherent power. In Johannine theology, Jesus Himself emphasizes a similar relational dynamic:John 5:30:\"I can do nothing on my own. As I hear, I judge…\"Here, Jesus expresses voluntary submission to the Father, not lack of divine power. The self-humbling of Christ—kenosis(Philippians 2:6-8)—demonstrates His willingness to operate within the limitations of human flesh, without divesting Himself of His divine essence. Likewise, Jesus’ miracles, performed \"by permission,\" reflect His incarnational humility rather than an absence of deity.The Pre-Existence and Divine Authority of JesusJohn's Gospel explicitly asserts the divine creative role of the Logos (the Word), identified with Jesus:John 1:1-3:\"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. Through Him all things were made; without Him nothing was made that has been made.\"This passage leaves no doubt that Jesus is the Agent of creation, co-equal and consubstantial with God the Father. This creative power is not borrowed, but intrinsic.The Quranic Dilemma: Creator vs. Non-CreatorReturning to the Quranic principle:Quran 16:17:\"Is then He Who creates like one who does not create?\"The Quranic argument is unequivocal: Only God creates. Therefore, if Jesus creates, as the Quran itself testifies, He partakes in the divine essence and prerogative. The Quran, in attempting to honor Jesus as a prophet, inadvertently confesses His divine creative power—an attribute exclusive to God alone.Conclusion: Jesus as the Divine CreatorBoth the Bible and the Quran, when read without apologetic prejudice, bear witness to the divine creative power of Jesus. The Quran’s testimony that Jesus creates life from clay and imparts the breath of life mirrors the Genesis account of God’s unique creative act. The New Testament reveals this same Jesus as the eternal Word through whom all things were made. No mere prophet, angel, or creature can claim the power to create ex nihilo or impart life—such power belongs to God alone.Therefore, the only consistent theological conclusion, based on the evidence from both scriptures, is that Jesus is God the Creator, worthy of worship and honor.By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteReferencesThe Holy Bible, Genesis 2:7; John 1:1-3; John 5:30; Philippians 2:6-8The Quran, Surah 3:49; 15:28; 16:17; 22:5This article is freely distributable in its original form.

This attribute, Al-Warith, is one of the 99 Names of Allah in the Quran.Does Jesus have this attribute of beingTHE INHERITOR OF ALL THINGS, “Al-Warith”? Let us first read the Quran and see if Allah possesses this attribute of Al-Warith.Surah Maryam 19:40:“So beware! Know that surely Allah is the inheritor of the entire world and everything in it, and their account is with Allah.”Allah says that He is the inheritor of all things in the Quran, which was written in the year 632 AD after Jesus. This means that Jesus was actually the first to declare these words, that He is the inheritor of all things, according to the evidence of the Bible, which came before the Quran.Let us now see if Jesus truly has this attribute of beingTHE INHERITOR OF ALL THINGS, which is the majesty of God alone according to the Quran, written 632 years after Jesus.The Holy Bible says the following about Jesus Christ:Hebrews 1:2:“But in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom he made the universe.”In this verse, we read that Jesus is called“HEIR OF ALL THINGS,”which is the majesty/attribute of Almighty God as also testified in the Quran, Surah 19:40. Therefore, Allah and the Quran have acknowledged that Jesus is God because the Bible, which preceded the Quran by 632 years, has confirmed that Jesus is the heir of all things—and this evidence is found in the Book of Hebrews 1:2.Dear friends, this is enough evidence to prove that Jesus is God, because today we have learned that Jesus was called and claimed to beTHE INHERITOR OF ALL THINGS632 years before the Quran was written. Now, between the Bible that came before the Quran and the Quran that came after the Bible, which book will you follow? Researchers in various fields always use the earliest data to authenticate matters. And the earliest data we have about the “Inheritor of All Things” is found in the Bible and says thatTHE INHERITOR OF ALL THINGS IS JESUS.There is no debate here about the inheritance of all things, which belongs to Jesus. For He is the Son of God and was confirmed as the heir of all things 632 years before the Quran.Today I have answered the question of Muslims: “Is Jesus God?” The Quran and Allah themselves say that Jesus is God because Jesus possesses all the majesty and/or attributes of God—and one of these attributes isAL-WARITH.In His service,Dr. Maxwell ShimbaCopyright © Max Shimba Ministries 2015",

    "full_content": "\"THE ROYAL WE\" OR \"PLURALITY OF RESPECT\" DEBUNKED:A Theological and Linguistic Critique of Plural Pronouns for Allah in the QuranBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis article critically examines the widespread Islamic defense of plural pronouns—\"We,\" \"Us,\" \"Our\"—used for Allah in the Quran. While Muslim scholars claim this represents the \"Royal We\" or \"Plurality of Respect,\" this justification faces significant theological and linguistic problems, especially when considering Quran 21:17 and the consistent Islamic insistence on divine simplicity and oneness (tawhid). Moreover, the phenomenon is analyzed within the context of the Quran's roots and compared to the biblical use of the plural \"Elohim.\" This article challenges the coherence and legitimacy of the \"Royal We\" claim, exposing its weaknesses and historical complications.IntroductionA recurring apologetic in Islamic theology asserts that when Allah says\"We,\" \"Us,\" or \"Our\"in the Quran, He is not referencing a plurality of beings, but instead employing a \"majestic plural,\" commonly called the\"Royal We.\"This explanation is routinely given whenever critics point to passages where Allah appears to speak as more than one (e.g., Quran 2:34, 21:17, 15:9).But if Allah is absolutely one—a singular entity with no partners or plurality—why does he consistently refer to himself in the plural? Does this align with Islamic claims about God's transcendence and uniqueness? Or does it expose an underlying syncretism or theological borrowing, possibly from the polytheistic backgrounds prevalent in pre-Islamic Arabia? And if Allah cannot be likened to humans (Quran 42:11), why borrow a distinctlyhuman, royal conventionto describe divine speech? This article will dissect these questions.Section 1: The \"Royal We\" in Language—A Human, Not Divine, ConventionThe \"Royal We\" or \"Plurality of Respect\" is well-known in certain human cultures, where monarchs and officials use plural pronouns to emphasize their status. In English, for example, Queen Victoria's \"We are not amused\" illustrates this convention. The use of such language isrooted in human social structures—hierarchies, courts, and collective leadership.Key Point:Nowhere in the Quran does Allah explain that His use of the plural is simply \"majestic.\"The Quran asserts, \"There is nothing like unto Him\" (Quran 42:11); Allah should not use human royal conventions to express Himself if He truly transcends all creation.Contrast:The God of the Bible—the term \"Elohim\" is a plural noun but is often used with singular verbs, and is consistently interpreted in Judeo-Christian theology as signifying majesty, fullness, or even a hint at plurality within unity (as in the Christian doctrine of the Trinity).In the Bible, there are moments (\"Let us make man in our image,\" Genesis 1:26) where the context supports this plural as meaningful.Section 2: The Qur'anic Plural—Confusion and ContradictionLet us look at specific Quranic texts. Allah often says \"We sent down,\" \"We created,\" or \"Our angels.\" However, in other places, Allah switches to \"I\"—for example, Quran 20:14: \"Indeed, I am Allah. There is no deity except Me, so worship Me…\"The Problem:If Allah is not plural, then why the switch? If the plural is \"majestic,\" why not use \"I\" throughout, to avoid theological confusion? The shift appears arbitrary and undermines the Quran’s own claim of clarity (Quran 12:1, 16:89).Quran 21:17 – The Test Case\"Had We intended to take a diversion, We could have taken it from [what is] with Us—if indeed We were to do so.\" (Quran 21:17, Sahih International)If \"We\" refers only to Allah, does it mean Allah is proposing to take Himself as a consort? Does this fit the Islamic concept of God's transcendence?If Muslims insist that \"We\" is a singular God, the verse becomes grammatically and theologically awkward—who is the potential partner? If \"We\" means more than one, it contradicts tawhid.Logical Impasse:Either the Quran is needlessly confusing in its language about God, or the plurality reflects an awkward attempt to cover over more ancient, pluralistic origins.Section 3: Allah, Plurality, and Pagan RootsThe historical origins of Allah as a deity must also be considered. Pre-Islamic Arabia was rife with polytheism; the Kaaba itself once housed360 idols. Scholarly research, including the works of Arthur Jeffery and Patricia Crone, indicates that \"Allah\" was originally regarded as the chief of a pantheon of gods.Argument:The plural pronouns (\"We,\" \"Us\") may reflect an amalgamation of various deities into one supreme figure, resulting in lingering linguistic plurality.Thus, Allah’s use of plural pronouns may not be \"majestic,\" but a vestige of his composite, pagan origins.Quranic Evidence:The Quran repeatedly condemns \"associating partners\" with Allah (shirk), yet the grammar of the Quran itself seems to betray an underlying plurality.Section 4: Elohim vs. Allah—A Theological DistinctionThe God of the Bible, as revealed in the Old Testament, uses the plural nounElohim, and the context (especially in Christian theology) sometimes supports a complex unity—fulfilled in the New Testament understanding of the Trinity. Thus, when God says \"Let Us make man,\" the context supports either a majestic plural or intra-divine conversation.By contrast, Islamic theologystrictly deniesany division, multiplicity, or partnership in the Godhead—Allah is asingle, undifferentiated entity. This makes the repeated use of plural pronouns not only confusing but theologically incoherent.Section 5: Conclusion—A Call for Consistency and ClarityIf Allah is truly one, eternal, indivisible, and beyond all human convention, then the persistent use of plural pronouns is inexplicable, misleading, and inconsistent with both the Quran’s own statements and Islamic doctrine.The use of \"We,\" \"Us,\" and \"Our\" is not only linguistically unnecessary, but also historically suspicious and theologically problematic.The explanation of the \"Royal We\" is a weak apologetic, especially given Islam’s strict prohibitions against likening God to human beings.In Summary:If Allah is absolutely one, he should express himself as \"I\"—a simple, clear, and unambiguous singular pronoun.The presence of plural language betrays either a confused borrowing from human tradition or, more troublingly, a holdover from earlier, pluralistic religious conceptions.The \"Royal We\" fails as a defense; it is a human linguistic device, not a divine one.Challenge:Muslim theologians are invited to provide a more consistent and theologically sound explanation, or else admit the profound ambiguity and historical borrowing inherent in their scriptures.Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteFor critical and academic engagement, contact:info@shimbatheology.eduReferences:Quran, various translationsGenesis 1:26, Hebrew BibleArthur Jeffery,The Foreign Vocabulary of the Qur'anPatricia Crone,Meccan Trade and the Rise of IslamStandard Islamic tafsirs on Quran 21:17",

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteA recurring challenge presented by Muslim interlocutors is the claim that Jesus never explicitly stated, \"I am God,\" and thus cannot be considered divine. This assertion is frequently encountered in interreligious dialogues, with critics insisting upon a direct statement from Jesus Himself, articulated in unequivocal terms. However, a close exegesis of the Christian Scriptures reveals that not only is the divinity of Christ affirmed throughout the New Testament, but there are passages in which Jesus, with His own mouth, confesses His identity as God.One of the most striking instances is found in the Book of Revelation, a text acknowledged in mainstream Christian canon and attributed to the apostle John. InRevelation 21:6–7, the speaker—Jesus Christ Himself—makes a direct and unambiguous declaration regarding His divine identity:\"He said to me: 'It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. To the thirsty I will give water without cost from the spring of the water of life. Those who are victorious will inherit all this, and I will be their God and they will be my children.'\"(Revelation 21:6–7, NIV)This passage is critically important for several reasons:1.Self-Identification as GodJesus proclaims, \"I will be their God, and they will be my children.\" The phrase is unambiguous. Here, the speaker is not merely affirming a prophetic or messianic role, but appropriates the very language that, throughout the Old Testament, is reserved for God alone (cf. Jeremiah 31:33, Ezekiel 37:27). By declaring Himself both \"the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End,\" Jesus invokes titles that in Jewish monotheism can only belong to YHWH, the one true God (cf. Isaiah 44:6, Isaiah 48:12).2.Direct Speech to JohnIt is essential to note that this statement is presented as a direct utterance from Christ to the apostle John—removing any ambiguity about the source. The passage is not a theological reflection by a later writer, but rather, is depicted as the very words of Jesus Himself, thus meeting the demand for explicit self-disclosure.3.Consistent Biblical WitnessThis confession aligns with numerous other New Testament testimonies to Jesus’ divinity. For example:In John 1:1–3, Jesus is identified as the pre-existent Word whowasGod.In John 20:28, Thomas confesses Jesus as \"My Lord and my God,\" which Jesus does not rebuke.In John 10:30, Jesus states, \"I and the Father are one,\" eliciting an attempted stoning for blasphemy by His Jewish hearers.4.Implications for Salvation and WorshipJesus' confession in Revelation 21:6–7 also addresses the soteriological implications of His divinity: \"To the thirsty I will give water without cost from the spring of the water of life.\" This echoes the unique, divine prerogative of giving eternal life—something ascribed to God alone throughout the Hebrew Scriptures (cf. Jeremiah 2:13).5.Theological and Apologetic ConsequenceThe explicit confession, \"I will be their God,\" stands as a direct response to Muslim objections. The claim that Jesus never identified Himself as God is not tenable in light of this text. Christian theology does not rest on a single verse, but Revelation 21:6–7 provides a direct and unambiguous affirmation of Christ’s divinity, spoken by Christ Himself.ConclusionTherefore, in light of the foregoing exegetical and theological analysis, it is evident that Jesus not only accepted divine titles and worship, but also explicitly confessed with His own mouth that He is God.The challenge now is not for Christians to prove what the Scriptures plainly declare, but for the reader to respond to this divine revelation. Jesus is the only way to eternal life (John 14:6); religions and human works cannot save, but Christ, who confesses Himself to be God, invites all to partake in the life that He alone can give.Accept Christ today and receive eternal life.For further inquiries and theological resources:Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteMax Shimba Ministries Org, 2014References:Holy Bible, New International Version.Brown, R.

    "full_content": "A Theological Challenge to the Islamic Conception of GodBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThe term “Father” as used by Jesus in reference to God stands at the heart of the Christian revelation and is foundational to Christian theology. Conversely, Allah in Islam categorically denies any notion of divine Fatherhood, explicitly repudiating the concept in the Qur’an. This paper explores the profound theological and historical discontinuities between the Christian God, who is revealed as Father in the ministry of Jesus, and Allah of the Islamic tradition. We address the central question:If Allah is the same God as the God of Jesus, why did He never reveal Himself as Father, and why did He wait centuries to correct this supposed error?1. The Fatherhood of God in the Teachings of JesusThe New Testament is saturated with references to God as “Father.” Jesus employs this intimate language over 170 times in the Gospels, not only in private prayers (Mark 14:36; John 17:1,11) but also in teaching the disciples to pray: “Our Father in heaven…” (Matthew 6:9). This Fatherhood is not merely metaphorical or functional, but ontological—expressing an essential relational dynamic within the Godhead (John 1:18; John 5:18; John 10:30).Moreover, the earliest Christian creeds and the apostolic witness unanimously affirm that God is eternally Father to the Son (Nicene Creed, c. 325 AD; cf. John 17:24).Scriptural Evidence:Matthew 11:27:“No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son…”John 5:18:The Jews tried to kill Jesus “because he was… calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God.”John 20:17:“I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.”This consistent, public, and unchallenged use of “Father” by Jesus is unparalleled in pre-Christian Jewish literature, highlighting its revelatory significance.2. The Silence and Absence of Allah in the GospelsIf, as Islamic polemic claims, Allah is the same God whom Jesus worshipped and revealed, we are compelled to ask:Where was Allah when Jesus called God “Father”?There are several options, none of which are satisfactory for Islamic theology:a)Allah was Silent or AbsentIf Allah is the God of the Gospel, why did He not correct Jesus—or the disciples, or the early Church—regarding the “error” of calling God “Father”?The Quran repeatedly insists, “It is not befitting to Allah that He should beget a son” (Quran 19:35; 112:3). Yet, for nearly 600 years, no divine correction is issued until Muhammad arises in 7th-century Arabia. Such divine silence is incongruent with the vigilance and corrective zeal Allah displays elsewhere in Islamic scripture.b)Allah is not the God whom Jesus RevealedA more logical conclusion is that the God revealed by Jesus—the God who calls Himself Father—is categorically distinct from Allah of the Quran. The Johannine and Synoptic traditions make clear that the Fatherhood of God is central, not peripheral, to Christ’s revelation.c)The Law of First Proclamation and Doctrinal ConsistencyIn biblical theology, the principle of “first proclamation” or “progressive revelation” holds that God’s self-revelation is consistent and unchanging (Malachi 3:6; James 1:17). The God of the Bible reveals Himself progressively, but never contradicts prior revelation. If Allah were truly the God of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Jesus, He could not introduce a doctrinal innovation that flatly contradicts the cornerstone of Christ’s message.3. The Qur’anic Rejection of Divine FatherhoodThe Qur’an not only avoids “Father” language, but outright rejects it:Quran 5:18:“The Jews and Christians say, ‘We are the children of Allah and His loved ones.’ Say, ‘Why then does He punish you for your sins?’”Quran 19:88-92:“And they say, ‘The Most Merciful has taken [for Himself] a son.’ You have done an atrocious thing…”Quran 112:3:“He neither begets nor is born.”This is not a matter of differing terminology but a fundamental theological chasm. Nowhere in the Qur’an does Allah ever reveal himself as Father. Islamic exegesis (tafsir) is unanimous: “Father” as a title for God is shirk (blasphemous association).4. Historical and Theological DiscontinuityIf Allah is the same God as the Father of Jesus, the absence of divine correction during the ministry of Jesus, the apostolic age, and the patristic period is inexplicable.Why did Allah wait over six centuries to send Muhammad to “correct” Jesus’ supposed error?Such a view not only indicts God’s providence and sovereignty but undermines the credibility of both Christian and Islamic scripture.Furthermore, if Allah is not the Father, then he cannot be the God of Jesus. The central Christian confession—that God is Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (Matthew 28:19)—excludes any deity who does not eternally exist as Father.5. Academic Consensus and Scholarly ReflectionsLarry Hurtado (Lord Jesus Christ: Devotion to Jesus in Earliest Christianity):The worship of Jesus as Son of the Father is the earliest and most distinctive mark of Christian faith, distinguishing it sharply from Judaism and, later, Islam.Richard Bauckham (Jesus and the God of Israel):The early church’s invocation of God as Father “rests on the direct teaching and example of Jesus.”Kenneth Cragg (The Call of the Minaret):“The Qur’an’s rejection of the divine Fatherhood stands as its most decisive break with Christian revelation.”6. Conclusion: Allah—A Different GodThe law of first proclamation, the consistency of divine revelation, and the unbroken testimony of the church require that the true God is the one revealed by Jesus as Father.The absence of any correction by Allah during the Gospel era, and the outright rejection of divine Fatherhood centuries later, strongly indicates that Allah is not the God of Jesus, but a later theological construct—one that came, not to fulfill, but to contradict the self-revelation of the God of the Bible.In sum:If Allah were God, He would have affirmed or corrected Jesus during his earthly ministry regarding calling God “Father.” The 600-year silence is theologically indefensible. Allah’s refusal to be “Father” is a categorical proof that he is not the God and Father of Jesus Christ.The God of Jesus is the Father—eternally, unchangeably, and uniquely so.To deny the Fatherhood of God is to deny the heart of Christian revelation.ReferencesThe Holy Bible (Matthew, John, Revelation, Malachi, James)The Holy Qur’an (Surahs 5, 19, 112)Larry Hurtado,Lord Jesus ChristRichard Bauckham,Jesus and the God of IsraelKenneth Cragg,The Call of the MinaretN.

Let us read:Galatians 1:1\"Paul, an apostle—sent not from men nor by a man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead.\"This verse is crystal clear:Paul was commissioned directly by God, not by any human or intermediary angel.Now, contrast this with Muhammad: the Qur'an openly declares that Muhammad received his message throughJibril (Gabriel), who is not God. According to Islamic sources, Muhammad never spoke to or saw God directly, but always through this angelic intermediary.In stark contrast, Scripture teaches that Paul’s apostleship came directly fromGod Himself.Romans 1:1\"Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle and set apart for the gospel of God.\"Therefore, from today onward, it must be understood clearly:Muslims are following a counterfeit message.Muhammad never spoke with God. Muhammad was not sent by God. He was afalse prophetwithout divine commission.All true prophets and apostles in the Bible conversed directly with God—without the need for an intermediary angel.Yet Muhammad relied entirely on Jibril, an angelic being allegedly sent by Allah.Why is Muhammad the only so-called prophet who needed an intermediary in his communications with his god?If Allah were truly the Almighty God, why would He need an intermediary to communicate with Muhammad? Why did the God of the Bible never require such intermediaries when speaking to His prophets?If you, Muslims,cannot produce a single verse from the Qur'an or the Bible stating that Paul was not an apostle of God, then your silence itself becomes undeniable evidence that Muhammad was afalse prophet, while Paul was indeed atrue apostle of the Living God.Additional Theological Questions for ReflectionIf Paul was not a true apostle, why did the early Church—both Jews and Gentiles—accept his writings as inspired Scripture?Why do even Islamic commentators admit that Paul’s influence on the early Christian Church was profound, while the Qur’an never explicitly denounces him?Why does the Qur’an mention other figures—like Jesus and Mary—but never directly mention Paul if he were so supposedly false? Would not a true \"final revelation\" warn against him?How can Muhammad’s supposed prophetic status be valid when no biblical prophet nor the New Testament apostles ever prophesied about Muhammad?Why do the biblical apostles (including Paul) show consistency with the Old Testament revelation of God, while Muhammad introduces doctrines contradictory to both Old and New Testaments?Why did Jesus never mention Muhammad, even though He foretold the coming of the Holy Spirit? Why does Paul confirm this teaching, while Muhammad contradicts it?Final ChallengeMuslims, produce your evidence!Bring us a verse from theQur’anor theBiblethat says:\"Paul was not an Apostle of God.\"Until then, your failure to do so is proof that Paul’s apostleship stands firm, and Muhammad’s prophethood remains unsubstantiated.The question remains:Why does the God of the Bible speakdirectlyto His chosen servants, while the Allah of Islam cannot?",

If you carefully examine the following verse, you will see that Jesus created, which is a unique attribute of God alone. Jesus raised the dead and healed the sick. However, nowhere do we read that Muhammad performed such miracles. Let us read from the Quran:Quran 5:110“When Allah will say: O Jesus, son of Mary! Remember My favor upon you and upon your mother when I supported you with the Holy Spirit. You spoke to the people in the cradle and in maturity; and [remember] when I taught you writing and wisdom and the Torah and the Gospel; and when you made out of clay the shape of a bird by My permission, then you breathed into it and it became a bird by My permission; and you healed the blind and the leper by My permission; and when you brought forth the dead by My permission; and when I restrained the Children of Israel from you when you came to them with clear proofs, but those who disbelieved among them said, ‘This is nothing but obvious magic.’”Dear brethren, today we have learned that Jesus was not an ordinary man. He performed deeds that only God Himself is able to do. This evidence is clearly found in the Quran. The claim that Jesus was just a Prophet like the others collapses after reading this verse, which reveals the divine glory manifested in Jesus. Has there ever been any Prophet or Messenger who created?Let us also examine the following Hadith from Al-Bukhari:Ibn 'Abbas said, “That indicated the death of the Messenger of Allah which Allah had informed (him of).” 'Umar said, “I do not understand it except as you understand it.” Aisha said: During his illness, which ultimately led to his death, the Prophet kept saying, “O Aisha, I still feel the pain caused by the food I ate at Khaibar, and at this time, I feel as if my aorta is being cut from that poison.”(Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 5, Book 59, Number 713)From this Hadith, we observe that the Prophet of Allah was afflicted by poison administered by a Jewish woman. This Hadith gives us clear evidence that the Prophet of Allah was praying for healing from Allah. The critical question here is: What happened to Muhammad after these prayers to Allah?Let us read further:In the following Hadith, we read that even Gabriel came to pray for the health of the Prophet, yet these prayers did not result in Muhammad’s healing.From Ibn Sad, page 265:The Prophet of Allah became ill and Gabriel prayed for him, saying, “In the name of Allah, I pray for your health and seek to protect you from all evil, from every envious one, and from all harm, and Allah will heal you.”Did the Prophet of Allah recover after these prayers? According to our first Hadith, the Prophet did not recover despite prayers from the Angel Gabriel. Yet in the Quran, we read that Jesus had the power to heal, raise the dead, and create—abilities neither Gabriel nor the Prophet Muhammad possessed.Dear brethren,Why follow a Prophet who lacked the power to heal?Why listen to an angel who could not heal, even though he was sent by Allah?Why would Allah send Gabriel to pray for Muhammad, knowing full well that Muhammad would not recover?These are a few questions you should consider. Is Allah truly God? If He is God, why did He fail to heal His own Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)?The Bible says the following in the Gospel of Mark:Mark 16:17-18“And these signs will accompany those who believe: In My name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up serpents with their hands; and if they drink any deadly thing, it will not harm them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover.”Christians have been given authority to pray for the sick in the Name of Jesus—something which does not exist in Islam. The Bible declares that, in the Name of Jesus, we cast out demons, heal the sick, raise the dead, and perform many wonders. Jesus gave us His Name, which is above every name—the only Name that can cast out demons, heal, resurrect, and perform mighty works. Jesus was not just a prophet or ordinary man. His deeds are continually manifested through His followers.I urge you to accept Jesus, who had the power to raise the dead, heal the sick, and create. These statements are confirmed in the Quran, and the Bible affirms them as well.If Allah is truly God, why did he send Gabriel to pray for Muhammad when he knew that Muhammad would die?May God richly bless you,In His Service,Dr. Maxwell ShimbaFor Max Shimba MinistriesCopyright © Max Shimba Ministries 2013",

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionA recurring objection among Muslim apologists is that the Bible, according to their selective citations, allegedly denies the divinity of Jesus Christ. As evidenced in the image above, verses are isolated from their literary, historical, and theological context to argue that Jesus is not God. Such arguments are not only theologically shallow but demonstrate a fundamental misunderstanding of the Christian doctrine of the Trinity and Christology as revealed in both the Old and New Testaments.This article provides a scholarly refutation of these claims and affirms the biblical and theological foundation of the divinity of Jesus Christ.1.Jesus’ Relationship with the Father Does Not Deny His DivinityThe argument that Jesus calling the Father \"the only true God\" (John 17:3) or referring to \"my God and your God\" (John 20:17) somehow denies His divinity is based on a misunderstanding of Trinitarian theology. In Christian doctrine, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are three distinct Persons, yet one in essence (homoousios).When Jesus speaks of the Father as God, He does so in accordance with His incarnate role as the Son who has humbled Himself (Philippians 2:6-8). The distinction of Persons does not imply a denial of essence or divinity. In fact, Jesus’ frequent references to God as His Father (e.g., John 5:18; 10:30) were understood by His Jewish contemporaries as a claim to equality with God:\"For this reason they tried all the more to kill him; not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father,making himself equal with God.\" (John 5:18, NIV)Key Point:Allah never called himself Fatherin the Quran. Jesus’ unique address of God as Father is not just relational; it is ontological, signifying His participation in the very being of God.2.Jesus’ Humility Does Not Contradict His DeityVerses such as \"the Father is greater than I\" (John 14:28) and \"I can do nothing by myself\" (John 5:30) reflect the doctrine of thekenosis—the self-emptying of the Son (Philippians 2:6-7). In His incarnation, Jesus voluntarily accepted the limitations of humanity without ceasing to be God. Early Church Fathers, from Athanasius to Augustine, consistently taught that Jesus’ subordination in function (not essence) was due to His incarnate mission.Key Point:Functional subordination in the economy of salvation is not ontological subordination.Jesus, as the God-Man, acts in perfect unity with the Father (John 10:30, “I and the Father are one”).3.Jesus’ Omniscience and Omnipotence in the Context of the IncarnationCiting Mark 13:32 (\"no one knows... not even the Son\") as proof against Jesus’ divinity ignores the theological nuance of the incarnation. As the eternal Logos, Jesus possesses all divine attributes (Colossians 2:9), but as the incarnate Son, He sometimes chose not to exercise His divine prerogatives (see also Luke 2:52).Gregory Nazianzus observed: “As man He was baptized, but He absolved sins as God... He is carried up to the temple as an infant, and He is worshiped there as God.”4.Jesus Worshipped and Prayed as the Incarnate SonJesus’ prayer (Matthew 26:39; Luke 6:12) is a necessary feature of His genuine humanity and His role as the perfect mediator (1 Timothy 2:5). Far from denying His divinity, His prayer life reveals His role as the Second Adam who succeeds where the first Adam failed (Romans 5:19).5.Jesus’ “Goodness” and the Claim of DivinityThe passage “Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone” (Mark 10:18) is not a denial of His deity. Rather, Jesus challenges the questioner to reflect on the implications of calling Him “good”—a divine attribute. If the questioner truly understood Jesus’ identity, he would recognize that Jesus is indeed “good” because He is God (see John 10:11, “I am the Good Shepherd”).6.Authority and the GiverMatthew 28:18 states that “all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.” This is not a denial of Christ’s divinity, but a proclamation of His exaltation post-resurrection (Philippians 2:9-11). The eternal Son, in union with the Father and Spirit, has all authority intrinsically; as the God-Man, He receives authority as the last Adam and universal Lord.7.Jesus as Prophet, Servant, and ManActs 2:22 and 1 Timothy 2:5 affirm the true humanity of Jesus. Orthodox Christian doctrine holds that Jesus is fully Godandfully man (the hypostatic union, John 1:14). To call Him a prophet or servant does not deny His divinity, but acknowledges the mystery of the incarnation.8.The Death of Christ and Divine ImmortalityThe objection “Jesus died — but God is immortal” is answered by the doctrine of the two natures of Christ. The divine nature did not die, but the human nature suffered death; this is the core of Christian soteriology (see Hebrews 2:9-14).9.Jesus’ Direct Claims to DeityMuslim apologists ignore or distort the many direct and indirect claims to deity by Jesus:John 8:58:“Before Abraham was, I AM.” (cf. Exodus 3:14)John 10:30:“I and the Father are one.”John 20:28:Thomas declares, “My Lord and my God!” and Jesus accepts the title.Revelation 1:17-18; 22:13:Jesus identifies Himself as the Alpha and Omega—the eternal God.Early Church Evidence:The earliest Christian hymns and prayers (Philippians 2:5-11; Colossians 1:15-20) ascribe worship and divine titles to Jesus. The apostolic witness is unequivocal:“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God... And the Word became flesh.” (John 1:1, 14)ConclusionThe argument that “according to the Bible, Jesus is not God” is a misrepresentation born from reading the text without reference to context, doctrine, or the totality of biblical revelation. Nowhere does Jesus deny His divinity; rather, He affirms it consistently, both in word and deed. The Christian confession that “Jesus is Lord” (Romans 10:9; Philippians 2:11) remains the foundation of Christian faith and is irrefutable from the biblical text.In contrast, the Quran never refers to Allah as “Father,” nor does it capture the intimate, ontological relationship between the Father and the Son as revealed by Jesus Christ. This unique revelation is at the heart of the Christian gospel.ReferencesBauckham, Richard.Jesus and the God of IsraelWright, N.T.Jesus and the Victory of GodKelly, J.N.D.Early Christian DoctrinesThe Nicene Creed (325 AD)The Bible: John 1:1-14; John 5:18; John 8:58; John 10:30-38; Philippians 2:5-11; Colossians 2:9; Hebrews 1:3-8; Revelation 1:8, 17-18; 22:13By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteOpening StatementIslamic tradition, as preserved in various hadith collections, raises significant questions about the theological standing and spiritual agency of women in Islam. One such hadith, found inSunan Ibn Majah950, asserts:\"Muhammad said the prayer is annulled by the passing of a dog, a donkey, or a woman.\"This statement not only equates a woman’s presence with animals considered impure in Islamic law but also implies that her very presence can invalidate a man’s communication with Allah. This foundational assumption brings forth deep theological dilemmas regarding the spiritual equality and ultimate fate of Muslim women. This article, structured as a debate, challenges Muslim scholars and believers to offer coherent answers to the following pressing questions.Point 1: The Contradiction in Worship – Are Women’s Prayers Heard?Challenge:If the mere presence of a woman can annul a man’s prayer, as indicated by the hadith, what does this imply about the efficacy and validity of a woman’s own prayer? Can a woman, whose existence is said to disrupt the worship of men, be assured that her own acts of worship are accepted by Allah? How can Muslim women maintain faith that their prayers will be heard, if the Prophet of Islam declared their presence inherently problematic to the act of prayer?Scholarly Counterpoint:Islamic orthodoxy claims both men and women are obligated to pray, and the Quran commands all believers—male and female—to engage in worship and obedience to Allah (Quran 33:35). However, the hadith presents a contradiction. If a woman can nullify a prayer simply by being present, does her prayer not risk nullification from her own existence or the presence of other women? How does Islamic theology reconcile this inconsistency?Point 2: Islam—A Religion for Men Alone?Challenge:Is Islam, at its core, a religion that centers men and marginalizes women? The testimony of the hadith above, along with many others, seems to relegate women to a spiritual status inferior to men—where her presence, voice, or even body is regarded as a source of fitnah (temptation) or spiritual pollution. Is this the egalitarian vision claimed by many apologists, or does Islam fundamentally prioritize men’s access to the divine?Scholarly Counterpoint:Proponents may argue that Islam honors women and affords them spiritual rights. Yet, the ritual exclusion in mosques, the secondary status in public prayers, and the legal disadvantages in matters of testimony, inheritance, and divorce paint a different picture. How does Islamic tradition justify these practices while claiming to uphold equality before God?Point 3: Promises of the Akhirah—What Awaits Muslim Women?Challenge:According to popular hadith and the broader Islamic eschatological imagination, righteous men in Paradise are promised 72 virgins (houris) as part of their reward (Sunan al-Tirmidhi 2562). But what is the reward for Muslim women in the afterlife? Is there a comparable promise, or does the vision of paradise cater exclusively to male desires? Does the Quran or authentic hadith literature ever promise believing women any concrete, individual reward that parallels what is described for men?Scholarly Counterpoint:Islamic scholars often claim that women will \"be satisfied\" in paradise and receive what their \"hearts desire\" (Quran 41:31). However, the texts are strikingly silent on details or specific promises for women, while being explicit for men. Does this not reveal a patriarchal conception of salvation and bliss, in which women are largely invisible or, at best, accessories to male pleasure?Point 4: The Double Standard of Ritual PurityChallenge:If women annul men’s prayers by their mere passage, does this principle apply in reverse? Can a man’s presence annul a woman’s prayer? If not, what is the theological rationale for this double standard? Does the presence of a man carry intrinsic spiritual purity denied to women? Does this not contradict the claim of universal spiritual equality before Allah?Scholarly Counterpoint:There is no parallel tradition where men’s presence is said to invalidate women’s prayers. This asymmetry points to a theological anthropology in Islam where men are normative and spiritually authoritative, while women are sources of ritual defect and pollution. How can this be reconciled with the Quranic assertion that \"the most honored of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous\" (Quran 49:13), regardless of gender?Conclusion: The Challenge for Muslim ApologistsThe foregoing questions present a profound challenge for Islamic theology:How can Muslim women have confidence in their prayers if their very presence is considered an impediment to men’s prayers?Why does Islamic eschatology privilege men with explicit sensual rewards, while offering women vague promises of satisfaction?What justification is there for the double standard of ritual purity and prayer validity?Call for Response:We call upon Muslim theologians, scholars, and apologists to respond with clear, textually grounded answers. Let them demonstrate, using the Quran and authentic hadith, that Islam provides true spiritual equality for women, both in this life and in the life to come. Until such answers are offered, the questions of spiritual agency, ritual participation, and the destiny of women in Islam remain unresolved and deeply problematic.By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThe intersection between religious revelation and scientific knowledge is a point of continuous discussion within theology, philosophy, and the natural sciences. Islam, through the Quran and Hadith, claims to present ultimate truth regarding human existence, including matters of creation and procreation. However, a critical examination of these sources—specifically, Surah At-Tariq (Quran 86:6-7) and Sahih Muslim 2644—reveals fundamental scientific errors that undermine such claims. This article seeks to provide a scholarly theological analysis alongside a scientific evaluation of these texts, illustrating why the Quran and the teachings of Muhammad lack scientific validity in this domain.Quranic Statement on Human Procreation: Surah At-Tariq 86:6-7“He was created from a fluid, ejected, emerging from between the backbone and the ribs.”— (Quran 86:6-7, Sahih International)Theological ContextClassical and contemporary Islamic commentators have interpreted this passage as describing the origin of human reproductive fluid (sperm). The \"backbone and the ribs\" (min bayni al-sulbi wa al-tara'ib) have been understood by many to refer to anatomical regions of the human body, often taken literally by classical exegesis.Scientific AnalysisModern biology and embryology have thoroughly mapped the processes of human conception:Origin of Sperm:Sperm is produced in the testicles (testes) of the male, which are anatomically located in the scrotum, not between the backbone and ribs.Origin of Ova:The female gamete (egg) is produced in the ovaries, which are also not located between the ribs and the backbone but rather in the pelvic region.Location of Fertilization:Fertilization typically occurs in the fallopian tubes, which are anatomically distant from both the backbone and the ribs.No modern anatomical or physiological source equates the production or ejection of reproductive fluids with the area \"between the backbone and the ribs.\" This is a clear misrepresentation of human biology.Hadith Statement on Sperm in the Womb: Sahih Muslim 2644\"When the drop of (semen) remains in the womb for forty or forty-five nights, the angel comes...\"— (Sahih Muslim 2644)Theological ContextThis hadith claims that after semen remains in the womb for 40 or 45 days, an angel descends to decree the future characteristics of the embryo—its fate, actions, lifespan, and sustenance.Scientific AnalysisModern science provides the following facts:Lifespan of Sperm:Sperm can survive inside the female reproductive tract for a maximum of 5-7 days under optimal conditions. After this, all sperm cells die.Embryological Development:Within 24 hours of fertilization, the sperm cell and egg cell combine to form a zygote, which then begins rapid cell division. By day 40, the embryo has already undergone significant development, including organogenesis (the formation of organs).Implantation:The embryo implants in the uterine wall approximately 6-10 days after fertilization—not after 40 or 45 days.The idea that sperm or a \"drop\" of semen remains unchanged in the womb for 40 or 45 days is unequivocally false according to embryology. No credible scientific source supports this claim.Combined Theological and Scientific Critique1. Theological Inerrancy versus Scientific ErrorIf, as Muslims claim, the Quran and authentic Hadith are the literal words of Allah and the infallible teachings of Muhammad, then scientific errors contained therein are deeply problematic. The infallibility claimed by Islam cannot be reconciled with demonstrable errors in anatomy and embryology.2. Consequences for Islamic Claims of Scientific MiraclesSome modern Islamic apologists attempt to reinterpret such verses metaphorically or claim they \"miraculously\" anticipated modern discoveries. However, the plain language of these passages, as well as classical exegesis, reveals that the original understanding was literal and in line with ancient pre-scientific beliefs.3. Comparison with Modern ScienceQuran:Claims sperm originates from a region between the backbone and ribs—scientifically false.Hadith:Claims sperm remains in the womb for 40/45 days—scientifically false.Science:Demonstrates clear, observable, and repeatable biological processes that contradict the above.Conclusion: Islam and Scientific ReliabilityThe examples analyzed above from both the Quran and Hadith demonstrate a fundamental disconnect from the realities discovered by modern science. Far from providing advanced knowledge or scientific miracles, these texts reflect the limited understanding of ancient peoples.Therefore, the Quran and the teachings of Muhammad cannot be considered reliable sources of scientific knowledge about human procreation. Instead, they serve as historical documents revealing the pre-scientific context of 7th-century Arabia.This realization challenges Islamic claims of divine scientific insight and calls for honest reflection within the theological and academic community regarding the nature and limits of religious texts.References:Quran 86:6-7 (Sahih International)Sahih Muslim 2644 (USC-MSA English Reference)Moore, K.L., Persaud, T.V.N., & Torchia, M.G.

    "full_content": "Where Are the Names of the Disciples of Isa bin Maryam in the Quran?An Academic Challenge to Islam, Allah, and the QuranBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThe Quran asserts its role as a confirmation of the previous scriptures, specifically the Torah (Tawrat) and the Gospel (Injeel). This claim is foundational in Islamic theology, where Muslims believe that the Quran verifies, protects, and clarifies the earlier revelations. However, a close academic scrutiny reveals significant omissions, particularly concerning key details about Isa bin Maryam (Jesus), whose ministry and followers are richly documented in the canonical Gospels. This article raises a direct challenge:Where are the names of the twelve disciples (apostles) of Isa bin Maryam in the Quran?The Theological Foundation1. The Claim of Quranic Completeness and ConfirmationThe Quran boldly declares itself as a “clear explanation of all things” (Quran 16:89) and “confirming what was before it of the Scripture” (Quran 5:48). Muslims are taught that the Quran provides guidance, light, and a criterion for judgment. If this is so, it must preserve or at least acknowledge the foundational facts that the Injeel (Gospel) records without ambiguity.2. The Names of the Apostles in the BibleIn the Christian Scriptures, the twelve apostles are individually named in multiple places (e.g., Matthew 10:2-4, Mark 3:16-19, Luke 6:14-16, Acts 1:13). Their names—Peter, James, John, Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot—are historical, unambiguous, and verifiable within the biblical record.The Quranic Silence1. Absence of Names in the QuranWhile the Quran mentions the “Hawariyyun” (disciples) of Isa (Quran 3:52, 5:111-115, 61:14), it never lists their names, nor does it provide any biographical details. This is a stunning omission, especially considering the Quran’s claim to confirm previous revelation and provide “clarification of all things.”2. The Islamic DilemmaIf the Quran confirms the Injeel, why does it not confirm this basic and universally recognized detail—the names of Jesus’s closest companions? Are the names not important to God? Or was this knowledge unavailable to Muhammad, the purported recipient of the Quranic revelation?3. Theological ImplicationsThe absence is not a trivial gap; it strikes at the heart of the Quran’s claim to completeness and divine authorship. If Allah truly revealed the Injeel and then sent down the Quran to confirm it, the expectation is that at least such fundamental historical truths would be preserved. Instead, the Quran only alludes vaguely to the “disciples” without identifying them.Scholarly ChallengeTo Muslim scholars, apologists, and clerics: Provide the twelve names of the disciples of Isa bin Maryam from the Quranic text.Cite the chapter (surah) and verse (ayah) where these names are found.Show how the Quran fulfills its own standard of confirming the Gospel.If such names cannot be produced from the Quran, then:How can one maintain that the Quran confirms the Gospel?Is the Quran truly “complete” as it claims (Quran 6:115, 16:89)?Or does this omission prove that the Quran is a man-made document, lacking essential historical details known to all biblical and historical sources?The Bible’s Superiority in Preserving RevelationIn contrast, the Christian Bible—both Old and New Testaments—has preserved detailed genealogies, names, places, and historical facts across centuries. The specificity of the biblical record stands in stark contrast to the generalities and omissions of the Quran.ConclusionThe inability of the Quran to provide the names of the twelve disciples of Isa bin Maryam is not merely an academic oversight but a theological indictment. It exposes the incompleteness and human origin of the Quran, which falls short of the standard it claims for itself.Unless verifiable evidence from the Quran is produced, this silence stands as proof that the Quran is not the infallible Word of God, unlike the Bible.References:Quran 3:52, 5:111-115, 61:14 (on the Hawariyyun)Matthew 10:2-4, Mark 3:16-19, Luke 6:14-16 (on the names of the apostles)Quran 5:48, 6:115, 16:89 (on Quranic claims to completeness and confirmation)By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThe doctrine of the attributes of Allah stands as one of the most complex and, at times, controversial aspects within Islamic theology, especially within Sunni orthodoxy. While Muslims affirm that Allah is unique, uncreated, and eternal, they also affirm that Allah possesses attributes—such as speech, knowledge, power, hand, face, and others—that are likewise described as uncreated and eternal. However, Sunni theologians also emphasize that these attributes are “not Allah Himself.” This paradox has generated profound debates throughout Islamic history, and yet the internal logic of this position demands rigorous philosophical and theological scrutiny.The Sunni Doctrine ExplainedSunni Islamic theology, particularly as articulated by the Ash’ari and Maturidi schools, holds the following positions:Allah Exists, Is Uncreated and Eternal:Allah is the unique, necessary, uncreated, and eternal being.Attributes Are Uncreated and Eternal:Allah’s attributes (Sifaat) are likewise uncreated and eternal, existing “with” Allah, but are not Allah Himself.Attributes Are Not Identical to Allah:While Allah cannot exist without His attributes, these attributes are ontologically distinct—they are not Allah, yet neither are they separate beings.Attributes Must Not Be Anthropomorphized:Muslims are forbidden to liken Allah to creation, even when the attributes (such as “hand,” “face,” “speech”) are described using anthropomorphic terms in the Qur’an and Hadith.The Critical QuestionsThis doctrine raises several crucial philosophical and theological questions, which will be posed as part of this debate:A. Can Something Exist, Be Uncreated and Eternal, Yet Not Be God?If the attributes of Allah—such as His knowledge, speech, or face—are themselves uncreated, eternal, and exist alongside Allah, are we not then positing multiple eternals? Islamic monotheism (tawhid) is uncompromising: there can be no partner, associate, or “second eternal” alongside Allah. Yet, if Allah’s attributes are not Allah but are uncreated and eternal, then we are presented with a kind of plurality within the divine essence. How does Sunni theology reconcile absolute divine unity (tawhid) with the real existence of multiple uncreated and eternal attributes that are not identical to Allah?B. Can Allah Exist Without His Attributes?The Quran and Hadith often speak of Allah’s hand, face, speech, knowledge, and will. If Allah’s attributes are not Allah, can Allah exist without them? If not, does it not follow that what is “not Allah” is nevertheless necessary for Allah’s very being? This undermines the classical doctrine of divine simplicity and unity. Are Muslims then claiming that the essence of Allah is dependent on what is “not Allah”?C. If Allah’s Attributes Are Not Allah, What Remains When They Are Removed?This is the heart of the analogy presented above. If every attribute—knowledge, will, power, hand, face, speech, etc.—is “not Allah,” then what is left that constitutes Allah? The logical conclusion is that nothing identifiable or knowable remains. Without attributes, an entity cannot be described, known, or even conceptualized. Are Muslims left worshipping a void, a “zero,” if all attributes are “not Allah”?Philosophical and Theological Implications1. The Problem of Divine PluralityIf all of Allah’s attributes are uncreated and eternal, but “not Allah,” Islamic theology is forced into a problematic position: either these attributes are themselves divine (leading to a kind of polytheism or “divine plurality”), or they are created (which Sunni Islam rejects). This tension mirrors, and in fact, exacerbates, the very objection that Muslims have historically raised against the Christian doctrine of the Trinity—namely, that it introduces plurality within the divine essence. Yet, classical Christianity maintains one essence with three persons, not multiple uncreated “not-Gods” alongside God.2. The Doctrine of Divine SimplicityClassical theism (Jewish, Christian, even many early Islamic philosophers like Ibn Sina) affirms that God is absolutely simple—there are no parts, components, or composition in God. However, the Sunni doctrine of the attributes introduces a real distinction between Allah and His attributes. This undermines the simplicity and unity that tawhid claims to preserve.3. The Knowability of GodIf Allah’s attributes are not Allah, yet these are the only means by which Allah is described, related to, or known, then Allah becomes utterly unknowable. All meaningful language about Allah, in this system, refers not to Allah Himself but only to things that are “not Allah.” This is a deep problem for any claim of divine self-revelation, worship, or relationship.Conclusion: The Dilemma SummarizedThe Sunni assertion that Allah’s attributes are “not Allah” but are uncreated and eternal leads inevitably to one of the following theological dilemmas:Either: There exists a multiplicity of eternals alongside Allah, undermining the very heart of Islamic monotheism.Or: Allah is ultimately unknowable, without any positive attributes, making worship and relationship with Allah impossible.Or: The doctrine is internally inconsistent and cannot sustain rational or theological scrutiny.In summary, if every attribute by which Allah is known is “not Allah,” what, then, is left that can be called “Allah”? Is this not an admission that the Allah of such theology is, in fact, a philosophical abstraction—an empty zero—rather than the living God revealed in Scripture and encountered in worship?Invitation to Muslim ScholarsThis article is written not as a polemic but as a challenge and invitation to Muslim scholars and laypersons alike:Can you present a coherent and rational account of Allah’s attributes that preserves true monotheism, divine simplicity, and the knowability of God? Or does this doctrine collapse into logical and theological incoherence?Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

Names encode historical, theological, and linguistic continuity across texts and centuries. The abrupt appearance of “Yahya” (يحيى) in the Quran, purportedly as the equivalent of the biblical John the Baptist, demands a rigorous linguistic investigation. The evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that “Yahya” is a uniquely Islamic fabrication, with no credible linguistic, historical, or textual precedent prior to the Quran.A. Semitic Transmission of the Name “John”The name John the Baptist enters Arabic through a continuous and well-documented chain of Semitic languages and biblical translations:Hebrew:The original name, יוֹחָנָן (Yochanan), meaning “Yahweh is gracious,” is widely attested in the Hebrew Bible and post-biblical literature.Greek:This becomes Ἰωάννης (Ioánnēs) in the Septuagint and New Testament Greek manuscripts.Syriac:In the Syriac Peshitta—a foundational Christian text for the Middle East—the name is rendered ܝܘܚܢܢ (Yuḥanan), closely mirroring the Hebrew original.Arabic (Pre-Islamic and Early Christian):When Christianity spread into the Arabic-speaking world, early translators rendered the name as يوحنا (Yūḥannā), a direct linguistic descendant of the Hebrew and Syriac forms.1This transmission is attested in ancient biblical manuscripts, liturgical texts, and hagiographies used by Arab Christians long before the rise of Islam. The “Yūḥannā” form is confirmed in the Arabic versions of the Gospels, in inscriptions, and in the works of pre-Islamic Arab poets familiar with Christian themes.2B. The Absence of “Yahya” in Pre-Islamic TraditionNo evidence exists for “Yahya” as a personal name in pre-Islamic Arabia, in any Jewish, Christian, or pagan records. Neither the Dead Sea Scrolls, rabbinic literature, early Arabic poetry, nor Christian liturgy record any prophet or notable figure by this name.Early Arabic Christian texts—such as the Sinai Arabic Codex 151 (9th century, based on earlier traditions), Arabic lectionaries, and the Diatessaron—uniformly use “Yūḥannā.”3Not a single extant document predating the Quran or contemporary with its earliest period refers to John the Baptist as “Yahya.”Even Islamic sources, such as Al-Tabari and Al-Qurtubi, acknowledge the name’s novelty and attempt to justify it theologically, rather than linguistically or historically.4Their explanations are apologetic, not evidential, relying on the idea of divine invention rather than etymological continuity.C. Theoretical Origins: Misinterpretation and Linguistic ErrorSeveral modern scholars propose that Muhammad, with limited exposure to Christian doctrine and the Hebrew-Aramaic scriptures, may have misunderstood the context of the name John. The Hebrew root חיה (ḥ-y-y), meaning “to live,” occasionally features in honorific titles or descriptions of spiritual status (e.g., “he lives before the Lord” or “living in the Spirit”).5It is conceivable that Muhammad or his informants (sometimes called \"Waraka ibn Nawfal\" or unnamed storytellers in Islamic tradition) confused such an epithet with a proper noun and coined “Yahya.”Other Quranic examples of apparent misrenderings or conflations support this hypothesis:The confusion of Mary, the mother of Jesus, with Miriam, the sister of Moses and Aaron (Quran 19:28).[6]The appearance of “Haman” as a minister of Pharaoh in Egypt, though Haman is a Persian character in the Book of Esther.[7]The unique Arabic rendering of Enoch as “Idris,” unattested in biblical or Jewish tradition.[8]These linguistic innovations are not evidence of authentic transmission but of a secondary, derivative, and often erroneous borrowing from biblical tradition.D. Quranic Claim of Uniqueness: Historical and Linguistic ErrorThe Quranic assertion in Surah Maryam 19:7—“We have not assigned to any before [this] name.” (Quran 19:7)—is not merely a claim to novelty but is a historically and linguistically demonstrable error. The name John (Yochanan/Yūḥannā) was not only well known but highly venerated in all relevant linguistic and religious communities for centuries before Muhammad.6The introduction of “Yahya” is thus an unmistakable break in the tradition of name transmission—a rupture that cannot be explained by any process of natural linguistic evolution or scriptural fidelity.E. Testimony of Arabic LexicographyClassical Arabic lexicons compiled before and after the Quran make no mention of “Yahya” as a name, outside the Quranic context.7Edward William Lane’s monumentalArabic-English Lexiconrecords “Yūḥannā” as the Christian name for John and only lists “Yahya” as the Islamic name for the Quranic prophet—derivative, not original.8F. Modern Academic ConsensusLeading contemporary scholars confirm that the Quranic “Yahya” is an invented form:Sidney H. Griffith states: “The Arabic Yūḥannā is the only form attested for John the Baptist among the Christian Arabs; Yahya is a Quranic innovation.”9Gabriel Said Reynolds notes: “The introduction of ‘Yahya’ in the Quran is unprecedented and appears to be a product of confusion with the verb ḥ-y-y (to live), rather than any known tradition.”10G.

Its introduction represents a rupture in the careful transmission of prophetic names—a rupture that points unmistakably to the Quran’s status as a secondary, often erroneous, reimagining of biblical tradition. The name’s uniqueness is not a sign of divine revelation, but of Muhammad’s unfamiliarity with the traditions he sought to appropriate.Footnotes and ReferencesWould you like this expanded into a full academic paper format (with abstract, introduction, etc.), or would you like to focus on further linguistic examples, additional philological details, or more interfaith citations?

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThe critical examination of the Islamic conception of Allah, especially in comparison to the biblical revelation of God, reveals substantial theological dissonance. One of the most controversial attributes ascribed to Allah in the Qur’an is that he is the \"best of deceivers\" (Arabic:makr). In Christian theology, the title \"deceiver\" is reserved for Satan, the adversary of God and man. The present article seeks to expose, through scholarly critique and theological exposition, how the Qur’anic portrayal of Allah aligns more closely with the biblical description of Satan than with the God of the Bible, thereby raising serious doubts about the credibility of Islam.1. The Biblical Identity of Satan as the DeceiverThe Bible is unequivocal in its depiction of Satan as the deceiver. Jesus Himself identifies Satan as “a liar and the father of lies” (John 8:44). In Revelation 12:9, Satan is described as “the great dragon… that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, who leads the whole world astray.” The very character of Satan is deception; his mission is to mislead humanity away from the truth of God.Relevant Biblical References:John 8:44: “You belong to your father, the devil… there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.”2 Corinthians 11:14: “And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.”Revelation 12:9: “…Satan, who leads the whole world astray.”2. Allah as “The Best of Deceivers” in the Qur’anThe Qur’an describes Allah as the “best of planners” or “best of deceivers” (khayru al-makirin). The Arabic wordmakrspecifically refers to cunning, plotting, and deceptive strategy.Qur’anic Evidence:Surah Al-Imran 3:54:“And they (the disbelievers) planned, but Allah planned. And Allah is the best of planners (makirin).”Surah Al-Anfal 8:30:“And [remember] when those who disbelieved plotted against you… but Allah plotted. And Allah is the best of planners.”Islamic exegesis (Tafsir)often admits thatmakrdenotes plotting or cunning, even deception.3. Allah Praying: The Crisis of Divine Self-SufficiencyAs cited in the provided evidence (Al-Adab Al-Mufrad 643), Islamic sources report that “Allah prays” for or upon Muhammad. This is theologically problematic:To whom does Allah pray?Prayer, by definition, is the act of supplication or worship directed to a higher power. If Allah prays, he is necessarily acknowledging one greater than himself, which undermines his supposed transcendence and omnipotence.Biblical God Never Prays:The God of the Bible receives prayer but never prays or supplicates. He is the eternal, self-sufficient “I AM” (Exodus 3:14), the uncreated Creator.4. Theological Implications: Allah and Satan—A Comparative AnalysisA. Shared Attributes of DeceptionBiblical Satan:Master deceiver, father of lies, seducer, and opposer of the truth.Qur’anic Allah:Declares himself the “best of deceivers,” admits to plotting and misleading, even permitting the use of lies (taqiyya) for self-preservation.B. The Incompatibility with Biblical TheologyThe God of the Bible is described as “Light, and in Him there is no darkness at all” (1 John 1:5).He “cannot lie” (Titus 1:2).Deception is utterly contrary to His nature.If the god of the Qur’an openly claims attributes that, according to the Bible, belong to Satan, then it follows that:Allah is not the God of the Bible.Islam is predicated upon a foundation that is theologically antithetical to biblical revelation.Islam, therefore, cannot be trusted as a divine faith, for it enshrines the very qualities the Bible condemns.5. Historical and Doctrinal RamificationsThroughout history, religions have been judged by the character of their deity. A god who is deceitful, who prays to another, and who aligns with the qualities ascribed to the enemy of humanity in Christian doctrine cannot be considered the true God. This exposes Islam as, at best, a human or even satanic fabrication designed to mislead.Supporting Scholarly ReferencesIbn Kathir (Tafsir):Acknowledges that “makr” means cunning and deception.Theological Lexicon of the New Testament (Ceslas Spicq):Contrasts biblical and Quranic conceptions of God’s character.6. Conclusion: Islam as a Fraudulent FaithIn light of the foregoing, the Qur’anic Allah's self-declaration as a deceiver and the admission that he “prays” (thereby acknowledging a higher power) presents a theological crisis that is insurmountable. By biblical standards, Allah's attributes are those of Satan, not the true God. Therefore, Islam, being based on such a conception of deity, is revealed as a fraud, unworthy of trust or faith.Final Scriptural Warning:“Do not be deceived: God is not mocked.” (Galatians 6:7)By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteReferences:The Holy Bible, NIV.The Qur’an, Saheeh International.Al-Adab Al-Mufrad, Book 31, Hadith 643.Ibn Kathir, Tafsir.Theological Lexicon of the New Testament.This article is for scholarly and theological debate purposes and invites critical engagement from all religious and academic communities.",

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThe value and dignity of women have been central questions throughout human history and across religions. The Islamic tradition, particularly as articulated in certain hadiths, has often been critiqued for its portrayal of women in ways that seem to denigrate their moral and spiritual status. One such narration is found inSahih Muslim 1403a, which states:“The woman advances and retires in the shape of a devil, so when one of you sees a woman, he should come to his wife, for that will repel what he feels in his heart.”(Sahih Muslim 1403a, sunnah.com)This article aims to challenge this narrative, analyzing it in light of biblical theology, Christian ethics, and reasoned academic discourse. We contrast it with the teachings of Christ and the broader Christian tradition regarding the human person, sexuality, and the intrinsic worth of women.1. The Islamic Hadith: Context and ImplicationsThe cited hadith from Sahih Muslim presents several theological and ethical problems:Reduction of Women to Objects of Temptation:Women are portrayed as agents of temptation, likened to the devil, whose mere presence is a cause for male lust and a threat to spiritual integrity.Blame Shifting and Moral Evasion:The responsibility for a man's lust is shifted away from the man and onto the woman, suggesting that the antidote to temptation is the act of marital intercourse, rather than personal moral discipline or spiritual renewal.Spiritual Devaluation:The hadith implicitly denies women spiritual agency, reducing their role to a test or a snare rather than co-bearers of the image of God.These implications run contrary to the ethical, psychological, and theological advances made in both modern scholarship and ancient Judeo-Christian traditions.2. The Biblical and Christian Worldview: Women, Temptation, and the MindContrast the above with the Christian Scriptures, which uphold a radically different vision for women and human sexuality:A. Women as Image-BearersFrom the beginning, Scripture affirms the full dignity and equality of women:Genesis 1:27:\"So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.\"Here, both men and women are declared bearers of the Imago Dei, possessing inherent value and moral agency.B. The Heart of Temptation: Responsibility and RenewalJesus’ teaching is both searching and liberating. He does not externalize the source of temptation, nor does He blame women:Matthew 5:27–28:\"Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.\"The locus of sin is within—the heart and mind—not in the body of another. This is a radical internalization of ethical responsibility. Lust is not provoked by the mere presence or form of a woman, but by the condition of the human heart.C. The Discipline of the MindPaul the Apostle further clarifies the Christian approach to intrusive or sinful thoughts:Romans 12:2:\"And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind...\"Philippians 4:8:\"Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest... think on these things.\"2 Corinthians 10:5:\"...bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ...\"The Christian ethic is not to flee to a physical remedy (such as intercourse) but to actively renew the mind and bring thoughts into submission to Christ.D. The Prayer for PurityPsalm 139:23–24:\"Search me, O God, and know my heart... And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.\"The pursuit of purity is a spiritual journey of inward transformation, not an external circumvention of temptation.3. Academic and Ethical Critique of the Islamic NarrativeA. Psychological AnalysisModern psychology affirms that sexual temptation originates internally. External stimuli may trigger, but never cause, lustful thoughts; responsibility lies within the individual. The Islamic hadith, by externalizing the blame, stunts personal growth and moral maturity.B. Historical and Theological ContextThe Quran itself at times upholds the dignity of women (e.g., Quran 33:35), yet the hadith literature—compiled centuries later—often undermines this by introducing misogynistic elements inconsistent with the Quran’s loftier principles and utterly alien to biblical revelation.C. The False Prophet and the Dignity of WomenJesus, regarded in Islam as a prophet, but in Christianity as Lord and Savior, never spoke of women in such dehumanizing terms. The fruits of the so-called “final prophet’s” teachings in the hadith betray a moral and spiritual regression.Isaiah 26:3:\"Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee.\"Peace and purity are the results of a mind anchored in God, not of fleeing to carnal remedies or blaming others.4. Conclusion: Towards a Theological Recovery of Human DignityA theology that reduces women to objects of temptation and blames them for men’s failings is not merely antiquated—it is fundamentally contrary to the gospel of Christ and to reason. True spiritual life, according to Christian revelation, is a matter of inward transformation by the Spirit, personal responsibility, and the mutual upholding of the dignity of all people—men and women alike.The Christian tradition calls us to:Reject misogynistic narrativesthat demonize women.Embrace inward renewaland personal accountability for our thoughts and actions.Affirm the equal dignity and spiritual potentialof both sexes, as co-heirs of grace (1 Peter 3:7).In the final analysis, only a renewed mind, submitted to the Lordship of Christ and rooted in the knowledge of God, can overcome the “carnal mind” and lead to life and peace (Romans 8:6).Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteReferencesSahih Muslim 1403a (sunnah.com/muslim:1403a)The Holy Bible (KJV): Genesis, Psalms, Isaiah, Matthew, Romans, 2 Corinthians, Philippians, 1 PeterThe Quran (33:35)Scholarly works on psychology of temptation and gender ethics",

    "full_content": "A Critical Theological and Logical Analysis of Inconsistencies in Islamic DoctrineBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionOne of the most foundational claims in Islam is that it is not a new religion but the very faith of all prophets from Adam to Muhammad. The Qur’an frequently asserts that “Islam” (submission to God) is the primordial and only valid religion in the eyes of Allah, and that all prophets were “Muslims.” Yet, a deep reading of the Qur’anic text produces a remarkable conundrum: multiple prophets, at different times, are each called “the first Muslim.” This apparent contradiction is not merely a superficial textual overlap, but rather, strikes at the core of Islamic self-understanding and scriptural coherence.In this article, I challenge Islamic scholars and apologists to provide clarity on a matter that, on its face, demonstrates profound internal inconsistency in Islamic doctrine. If Adam was the first human being—and also the first Muslim—how can Moses, Abraham, and Muhammad each also claim the status of “the first Muslim” in their respective eras? This inquiry is vital, not only for the intellectual integrity of Islamic theology but also for those who seek the truth in the Abrahamic traditions.The Qur’anic PassagesLet us examine the Qur’anic verses cited in the attached illustration:Adam: “The First Muslim”Quran 20:115: “And We had already taken a promise from Adam before, but he forgot; and We found not in him determination.”Note: This verse does not explicitly call Adam the first Muslim, but Islamic exegesis often does.Noah, Abraham, and Moses: “The First Muslim”Abraham: Quran 2:132: “And Abraham instructed his sons... ‘Indeed Allah has chosen for you this religion, so do not die except while you are Muslims.’”Moses: Quran 7:143: “And when Moses came at the appointed time and his Lord spoke to him, he asked... I am the first of the believers (Muslimin).”Noah: Quran 10:72: Noah is also described as submitting to Allah, sometimes rendered as “Muslim.”Muhammad: “The First Muslim”Quran 39:12: “And I am commanded to be the first of the Muslims (awwala al-muslimeen).”Logical and Theological Problems1.Chronological InconsistencyIf Adam is truly the first human—and by extension, the first “Muslim”—it is logically impossible for later figures such as Abraham, Moses, or Muhammad to also be the “first” Muslims. The term “first” is absolute, not relative. Once a position is occupied, it cannot be claimed by another, unless the designation is entirely symbolic or contextually limited, which itself undermines any claim to absolute theological truth.2.Contextual AmbiguityIslamic apologists sometimes argue that each prophet is “the first Muslim”of their own people or time. However, the Qur’an does not consistently use qualifying language to support this. Instead, the statements are often universal:Moses: “I am the first of the believers.” (Quran 7:143)Muhammad: “I am commanded to be the first of the Muslims.” (Quran 39:12)This lack of specificity introduces theological ambiguity. If each prophet is only “the first Muslim” in a restricted sense (i.e., within their own era or community), then the title loses its doctrinal weight and devolves into a meaningless redundancy, applicable to any prophet at any time.3.The Nature of Islamic ContinuityIslam claims that its message is unchanged from Adam through Muhammad. If all prophets are Muslims, then Adam is not only the first human but necessarily the first Muslim. Subsequent prophets, being his descendants, are by default following the path already laid out. To retroactively call Abraham, Moses, or Muhammad “the first Muslim” creates a contradiction: it cannot be both that Adam was the first and that others after him can also be the first. If they are “first” in restoring a lost faith, then Islam is not a continual revelation, but an intermittent, revivable tradition—which contradicts the Islamic claim of unbroken continuity.4.Textual Eisegesis and Doctrinal InflationIslamic tradition often reads later doctrine into earlier scripture (eisegesis). The term “Muslim” in Arabic simply means “one who submits.” While it can be used generically, Islam claims it as the exclusive identity of all who follow its tenets. However, the Qur’anic application of “the first Muslim” to different figures appears more as a rhetorical flourish than a precise theological term. If so, the very claim that all prophets were “Muslims” is rendered linguistically and doctrinally suspect.5.Implications for Islamic Salvation HistoryIf the Qur’an’s terminology cannot withstand logical scrutiny, what does this mean for its reliability as a divinely revealed text? If “the first Muslim” can mean multiple things, or apply to multiple people at different times without clear contextual boundaries, then the theological framework of Islam suffers from internal incoherence.Conclusion: A Call for Honest ReappraisalThe question of “Who was the first Muslim?” is not a mere academic curiosity, but a fundamental test of scriptural integrity and doctrinal consistency. The fact that Adam, Abraham, Moses, and Muhammad are all called “the first Muslim” at various points in the Qur’an is not a trivial matter—it exposes a core inconsistency at the heart of Islamic self-definition.I call upon Islamic theologians, apologists, and believers to confront this contradiction with intellectual honesty. How can Islam claim to be the primordial faith if it cannot even maintain consistency in designating its first adherent? Does this multiplicity of “first Muslims” point to a deeper confusion about the nature of Islamic revelation and history?Until such questions are satisfactorily addressed, the claim that Islam is a seamless, internally consistent faith cannot be credibly sustained.Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

    "full_content": "A Theological and Historical DebateBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThe claim that Islam is both the oldest and fastest-growing religion in the world is frequently asserted in Muslim apologetics. Islamic tradition contends that Adam, the first human being, was a Muslim, thereby extending the roots of Islam back to the very beginning of humanity—approximately 6,000 years ago. In contrast, Christianity, as per Muslim narratives, was founded only 2,000 years ago, yet it currently has more adherents worldwide. This article aims to critically examine and debate the veracity of Islamic claims regarding the age and growth of Islam in comparison to Christianity, employing historical data, demographic trends, and theological perspectives.1. Islamic Claims: Islam from Adam?Islamic doctrine asserts that all prophets, from Adam to Muhammad, preached \"Islam\" (submission to the one God). The Qur’an claims,“He [Allah] has chosen you and has not placed upon you in the religion any difficulty. It is the religion of your father, Abraham”(Qur’an 22:78), and further,“Indeed, the religion in the sight of Allah is Islam”(Qur’an 3:19). On this basis, many Muslims maintain that Islam is not merely 1,400 years old (from Muhammad), but as old as humanity itself.Critical AnalysisThis theological assertion, however, is problematic when scrutinized through the lens of historical and textual criticism. No credible archaeological or textual evidence exists to demonstrate that Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, or Jesus practiced Islam in the sense understood today (Shahada, Salat, Zakat, Sawm, Hajj). Rather, these figures are situated in different cultural, historical, and theological contexts, each with distinct beliefs, rituals, and scriptures. The retrojection of Islam onto all previous prophets is a theological assertion, not a historical fact.2. Christianity: Historical Growth and ImpactChristianity, according to most historians, began in the first century AD, with Jesus of Nazareth and his disciples, and rapidly spread throughout the Roman Empire and beyond. Unlike the Islamic narrative, Christianity’s origins and explosive growth are well-documented in both secular and ecclesiastical history.Statistical EvidenceChristianity has approximately2.9 billion adherents(Pew Research Center, 2024), making it the largest religion on earth.Islam, with around1.9 billion adherents, is the second largest.Christianity achieved this growthin less than 2,000 years, compared to Islam’s claim of 6,000 years of existence.3. The Fallacy of the \"Fastest-Growing Religion\" ClaimMuslims often claim that Islam is the \"fastest-growing religion.\" This statement is misleading for several reasons:A. Historical Longevity vs. MembershipIf Islam has truly existed since Adam (6,000 years), why does it lag behind Christianity, which is demonstrably younger, in total adherents? Logically, a religion with a 4,000-year head start should have more followers, not fewer. The numbers do not support the narrative of continuous, uninterrupted Islamic faith from Adam onward.B. Growth Rate MisconceptionsClaims about Islam being the fastest-growing religion often conflate natural population growth in Muslim-majority countries with actual religious conversions. Most demographic studies reveal that the primary driver of Muslim population growth isbirth rate, not conversion.A 2015 Pew Research Center report states:\"Muslims are projected to grow more than twice as fast as the overall world population between 2015 and 2060. But much of this is due to higher fertility rates, not mass conversions.\"C. Christianity’s Global SpreadUnlike Islam, Christianity’s growth is marked by massive global missionary efforts and conversions, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America. In terms of cross-cultural adoption and religious transformation, Christianity has had the most dramatic impact in human history.4. Theological and Philosophical ObjectionsA. Redefining \"Islam\"Muslim apologists redefine \"Islam\" as \"submission to God,\" then retroactively apply it to all righteous figures. But this is not what is meant by \"Islam\" today—a faith defined by the Qur’an, the Sunnah, and specific rituals. Historical Judaism, Christianity, and the ancient faiths of the Near East had fundamentally different beliefs and practices.B. Contradictions in the Islamic NarrativeIf Islam was the original and universal faith, why do we seeno evidence of Islamic practices before Muhammad—no mosques, no Qur’an, no record of the Shahada, no Ramadan, no Hajj to Mecca among ancient Israelites or Christians? To claim continuity without evidence is to make an untestable assertion.5. Conclusion: A Call for Intellectual HonestyThis debate reveals a fundamental weakness in the Islamic apologetic narrative:Historically, Christianity is younger yet outpaces Islam in both adherents and global influence.Demographically, Islam’s growth is primarily due to higher birth rates, not conversions.Theologically, the claim that all prophets were \"Muslims\" is unsupported by evidence and amounts to anachronistic revisionism.Therefore, if the criterion for a \"fastest-growing\" religion is based on total adherents over time, Christianity—not Islam—holds that distinction.I challenge my Muslim counterparts to present verifiable evidence, not mere assertions, if they wish to maintain their claim. Until then, the logical, historical, and statistical case rests solidly with Christianity.Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteReferences:Pew Research Center, “The Future of World Religions: Population Growth Projections, 2010-2050,” 2015; updated data, 2024.The Qur’an, Surah 3:19, 22:78.The Bible, Acts 2:41-47; Matthew 28:19-20.Academic literature on religious demographics and historical origins.",

    "full_content": "An Academic Analysis of Quran 33:50 and Its Societal ImpactBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis article presents a critical theological and scientific analysis of the Islamic allowance of consanguineous marriages, as derived from Quran 33:50 and the prophetic practices of Muhammad. Through exegetical engagement with Islamic texts and interdisciplinary consultation with genetic science, this paper aims to challenge the doctrinal and practical legitimacy of intra-family marriages, highlighting the resultant negative consequences for contemporary Muslim societies.1. IntroductionMarriage customs are foundational to the ethical, cultural, and biological health of societies. Across history, religious traditions have shaped the parameters of permissible marital unions. In Islam, the Quran and the Hadith corpus provide explicit guidelines concerning the permissibility of marrying relatives, a practice embodied by Muhammad himself. This article critically interrogates the theological rationale behind these allowances and presents a comprehensive analysis of the deleterious effects of such practices, particularly in the light of modern genetics and global health.2. Quranic Permission for Consanguineous MarriageQuran 33:50states:“O Prophet! Verily, We have made lawful to you your wives to whom you have paid their dowries, and those whom your right hand possesses out of the prisoners of war whom Allah has assigned to you, and the daughters of your paternal uncles and aunts, and the daughters of your maternal uncles and aunts, who emigrated with you…”(Sahih Internationaltranslation)This verse explicitly permits Muhammad to marry his cousins and by extension, it has shaped Islamic jurisprudence regarding the lawfulness of cousin marriage (consanguinity). Islamic law (fiqh) remains distinctive among world religions for its wide acceptance of intra-familial unions, especially first-cousin marriages (see:Sahih Bukhari 62:27). Muhammad’s own marriage to Zaynab bint Jahsh, his paternal cousin (see Quran 33:37), established a direct prophetic precedent.3. Theological Implications: A Comparative CritiqueWhile Islam authorizes cousin marriages, both Judaism and Christianity, particularly in their later doctrinal and canonical developments, imposed increasing restrictions on such unions. For instance,Leviticus 18:6-18enumerates prohibited degrees of kinship for marriage, based on the principle ofkedushah(holiness/separation). The Christian tradition, especially post-early church councils, further expanded prohibitions on consanguinity to protect both spiritual and physical well-being.This theological divergence is not arbitrary; it reflects a teleological concern for the integrity and flourishing of the human family as an image-bearing community (Genesis 1:27; 2 Corinthians 6:17). The Islamic position, as reflected in both scripture and prophetic practice, appears more permissive, arguably due to the tribal social structure of 7th-century Arabia, yet this raises ethical and theological questions in the context of God’s design for human health and diversity.4. Muhammad’s Example and Its Enduring InfluenceThe personal example of Muhammad, who married Zaynab bint Jahsh (his cousin), serves as the behavioral model for Muslims, as Muhammad is described asuswa hasana—the “beautiful pattern” (Quran 33:21). This prophetic endorsement has perpetuated the practice among Muslims globally. According to the United Nations Population Fund,consanguineous marriage rates in Muslim-majority countriesremain significantly higher than in non-Muslim regions, with cousin marriages comprising up to 50% of all unions in some communities (UNFPA, 2022).5. Scientific and Biological Consequences of ConsanguinityModern genetics offers a stark warning regarding the practice of marrying close relatives. Consanguineous marriages dramatically increase the risk of congenital disorders and genetic diseases due to the increased probability of inheriting autosomal recessive conditions.5.1 Genetic RisksHigher Incidence of Birth Defects:Research shows that children born to first-cousin unions have a 2–3 times higher risk of congenital malformations, intellectual disability, and hereditary diseases (Bittles, A.H., 2001,The Lancet).Increased Infant Mortality:Studies indicate higher infant and child mortality rates among populations practicing regular consanguinity.Long-Term Health Burden:Communities with persistent intra-family marriage exhibit higher rates of genetic illnesses (e.g., thalassemia, cystic fibrosis, spinal muscular atrophy).5.2 Societal and Ethical ImpactThe social normalization of consanguineous marriages in Muslim-majority countries perpetuates a cycle of genetic illness and poses ethical questions about the stewardship of human life and health. The World Health Organization and medical ethicists recommend against cousin marriages due to these well-documented risks.6. Conclusion: Theological and Scientific ResponsibilityThe Quranic allowance for cousin marriage (Quran 33:50), modeled by Muhammad, has had a lasting and measurable impact on the health of Muslim societies. From a theological perspective, this raises questions about the nature of divine legislation and its consonance with the well-being of humanity. Scientifically, the evidence is unequivocal: intra-family marriages carry grave genetic risks that are neither compatible with the biblical ethos of life preservation nor with modern principles of bioethics.A Call to ReconsiderationFor the sake of public health, theological integrity, and future generations, it is incumbent upon religious scholars, community leaders, and policymakers to reconsider and reformulate marital norms in light of both scriptural evidence and scientific reality. True religion should not perpetuate harm but should uphold the flourishing of the human family in all its diversity.ReferencesThe Holy Quran, 33:50, 33:37, 33:21Sahih Bukhari 62:27The Holy Bible, Leviticus 18:6-18, Genesis 1:27, 2 Corinthians 6:17Bittles, A.H.

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThroughout history, the nature and character of God have been central to the world’s great monotheistic faiths. However, while both Islam and Christianity profess belief in one God, the conception of God’s character, particularly regarding truthfulness and deception, diverges significantly between the Bible and the Qur’an. This article offers a rigorous theological critique of the Islamic concept of Allah in light of key biblical doctrines, exposing critical incompatibilities and affirming the unique deity of Jesus Christ as revealed in Scripture.I. The God of the Bible: The Impossibility of DeceitIn biblical theology, God’s truthfulness is not merely an attribute but an essential aspect of His very being. The Bible insists repeatedly that God cannot lie or act contrary to His own righteous nature:“God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?”Numbers 23:19, KJV1Paul reiterates this foundational truth:“In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began.”Titus 1:2, KJV2The writer of Hebrews declares the impossibility of God lying:“…in which it is impossible for God to lie…”Hebrews 6:18, ESV3These verses collectively reveal that truthfulness is intrinsic to the divine identity. The impossibility of deceit is not a voluntary limitation, but a logical necessity of God’s nature as the ultimate moral being.II. The Qur’anic Depiction of Allah: The “Best of Deceivers”?A profound challenge to the biblical doctrine arises in the Qur’an, which describes Allah using terms associated with deception. Consider Surah 3:54:“And they (the disbelievers) planned, but Allah planned. And Allah is the best of planners.”Qur’an 3:54, Sahih International4The key Arabic word here ismakara, which has a semantic range that includes “to plot,” “to scheme,” “to deceive,” or “to act with guile.” Notably, more literal translations render it:“And they cheated/deceived and Allah cheated/deceived, and Allah is the best of the cheaters/deceivers.”Qur’an 3:54, M. A. Samira5Classical Islamic commentaries do not dispute the usage of makara in this sense; rather, they interpret Allah’s “deception” as a righteous response to the deception of others. However, from a biblical perspective, such attribution of deceit—even in response to evil—stands in direct contradiction to the holy nature of God.Other Qur’anic passages echo this troubling attribute:“And (the unbelievers) schemed, and Allah schemed against them: and Allah is the best of schemers.”Qur’an 8:30, Pickthall6The repeated use ofmakarafor Allah’s actions raises critical theological questions: Can the one true God ever justifiably engage in deception? Does moral relativism apply to the divine nature?III. Satan: The Biblical Paradigm of DeceptionIn stark contrast to the Qur’anic depiction, the Bible ascribes all deception, cunning, and falsehood to Satan, the great adversary of God and humanity:“…that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world…”Revelation 12:9, KJV7Jesus further clarifies the origin of all lies:“You are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks out of his own character, for he is a liar and the father of lies.”John 8:44, ESV8Scripture is consistent and absolute: deception is wholly incompatible with the holy nature of God and is the very signature of Satan.IV. The Uniqueness of Jesus Christ: Sinlessness and DivinityRemarkably, both the Bible and the Qur’an bear witness to the sinlessness and unique holiness of Jesus Christ:Biblical Testimony“He committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth.”1 Peter 2:22, ESV9“Which of you convicts me of sin?”John 8:46, ESV“…Holy, innocent, unstained, separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens.”Hebrews 7:26, ESVQur’anic Testimony“He said: ‘I am only a messenger of thy Lord, to announce to thee the gift of a holy son.’”Qur’an 19:19, Yusuf Ali10No other prophet—neither Moses, Abraham, Muhammad, nor any other—is described as “holy” or sinless in such absolute terms in either scripture.Jesus, furthermore, declares Himself to be the personification of truth:“I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no one comes to the Father except through me.”John 14:6, ESV11If perfect truthfulness is the mark of God, and Jesus alone fulfills this without the stain of sin or deceit, then by biblical and Qur’anic testimony, Jesus alone is qualified to be called God.V. Theological Implications and Critical ReflectionThe Qur’an’s depiction of Allah as the “best of deceivers” presents a profound theological crisis. If the standard of deity is set by the biblical revelation—utter moral perfection and incapacity for falsehood—then the Qur’anic Allah cannot be identified as the same God as YHWH, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The God of the Bible cannot lie. The Qur’anic Allah can and does.This contrast is not a matter of semantics but of the very essence of God. As C.S. Lewis argued, “If God is not good, then He is not God at all.”12Any being who deceives, regardless of motivation, cannot be the God of truth and light.Furthermore, the evidence points unerringly to Jesus Christ, who, according to both sacred texts, is uniquely sinless and absolutely true. As such, the only logical and theological conclusion is that Jesus is indeed God incarnate, and that the standard of deity is met in Him alone.ConclusionThe integrity of God’s character stands or falls on the issue of truthfulness. The biblical God is a God who cannot lie; the Qur’anic Allah is described as a deceiver. By the standards set in Scripture, only Jesus Christ—the sinless, holy, and truthful Son—is truly God. To worship any other is to exchange the truth of God for a lie.By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteFootnotesFor further engagement or scholarly dialogue, please contact Shimba Theological Institute.Would you like further expansion on any specific subtopic, additional rebuttals to common Islamic objections, or more references from classical Islamic sources?FootnotesNumbers 23:19, King James Version (KJV).↩Titus 1:2, KJV.↩Hebrews 6:18, English Standard Version (ESV).↩Qur’an 3:54, Sahih International.

This article explores the Qur’anic narrative of this metaphor and compares it with its treatment in the words of Jesus Christ, aiming to uncover deeper theological meanings regarding the nature and limits of divine power.1Qur’anic Perspective: The Inaccessibility of Paradise for Deniers of God’s SignsLet us begin by examining the relevant passage from the Qur’an, Surah Al-A‘raf (7:40):\"Indeed, those who deny Our signs and are arrogant towards them—the gates of heaven will not be opened for them, nor will they enter Paradise until the camel passes through the eye of the needle. Thus do We recompense the criminals.\"(Qur’an 7:40, Saheeh International)2This passage asserts that those who reject Allah’s signs will categorically be denied access to Paradise, a prohibition described as so absolute that it would only be reversed if a camel could pass through the eye of a needle—an event that is, by all human reckoning, impossible. The Qur’anic metaphor thus emphasizes the utter impossibility of salvation for those who persistently reject divine revelation.3The New Testament: Divine Omnipotence in the Teachings of Jesus ChristIn contrast, the New Testament presents the same imagery in a different theological light. Jesus uses the phrase in His teachings about the difficulty of a rich man entering the kingdom of God:Mark 10:25: \"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.\"4Luke 18:25: \"Indeed, it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.\"5Matthew 19:24: \"Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.\"6However, Jesus immediately follows this metaphor with a critical theological assertion regarding divine possibility:Mark 10:27: \"Jesus looked at them and said, ‘With man it is impossible, but not with God. For all things are possible with God.’\"7This key distinction establishes that, while human effort is insufficient to achieve what is metaphorically impossible, God’s omnipotence transcends all human limitations.8Theological Implications: Divine Power in Christianity versus IslamThe Qur’anic statement in Surah Al-A‘raf presents an impossibility as an insurmountable barrier, even by divine decree.9Conversely, the Christian Scriptures, while affirming the impossibility of the task for humans, assert unequivocally that for God, nothing is impossible (see alsoEphesians 3:20: \"Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us.\"10). This claim serves as a cornerstone of Christian faith in the absolute omnipotence of God manifested in Jesus Christ (cf.Titus 2:1311).ConclusionA careful comparison of these texts highlights a significant doctrinal divergence between Islam and Christianity regarding the limits—or lack thereof—of divine ability. The Qur’anic text sets an absolute limit for certain sinners, while the New Testament proclaims a God who is unconstrained by any impossibility. Thus, the person of Jesus Christ is presented as possessing the power to accomplish what is otherwise unachievable, affirming His divinity and omnipotence.12Shalom,Dr. Maxwell ShimbaServant of Jesus Christ, the Most High God (Titus 2:13)References & FootnotesIf you need this in a different citation style (e.g., APA, Chicago footnotes, SBL), or would like expanded academic references, please specify!FootnotesFor a broader treatment of comparative monotheism, see: Parrinder, Geoffrey.Jesus in the Qur’an.

For adherents, the prophet's moral and personal life sets a paradigm of spiritual conduct. In Islamic tradition, Muhammad is held as al-Insan al-Kamil (“the perfect human”). However, when subjected to historical scrutiny and theological analysis, significant inconsistencies and moral deficiencies emerge, challenging his claim to prophetic perfection.Historical Testimony: Muhammad’s Eating HabitsCiting the historical workKitabu cha Historia ya Mtume Muhammadby Mohammed Riday of Mombasa, Kenya (p.176, paragraph 5), we read:\"Prophet Muhammad would not eat until he was overtaken by hunger, and even when he did eat, he was never satisfied…\"\"This is a prophet of Allah, who, when eating, never seemed to be satisfied, often eating until he was overfull. Beyond this, he was described as selfish in his habits.\"Such descriptions from Muslim historical sources themselves point to a portrait of Muhammad that diverges significantly from the traditional narrative of asceticism and generosity. The implication of selfishness and insatiability in a prophet, especially regarding food, demands serious theological reflection.Quranic Evidence: Restriction and Social ConductSurah Al-Ahzab 33:53 provides further insight:“O you who believe! Do not enter the Prophet’s houses—except when you are permitted for a meal, without waiting for its readiness. But when you are invited, then enter; and when you have eaten, disperse, without seeking to remain for conversation. Verily, that would cause annoyance to the Prophet, and he would be shy of you; but Allah is not shy of [telling you] the truth... And it is not [right] for you to offend the Messenger of Allah, nor to marry his wives after him, ever. Indeed, that would be an enormity in the sight of Allah.”(Qur'an 33:53)This verse reveals a Prophet who, far from being hospitable, is so troubled by the presence of guests and extended conversation that divine revelation is invoked to regulate social conduct around his home. The instruction is clear: do not linger after eating, do not engage in casual conversation, and do not “annoy” the Prophet. The Quran, in this context, appears to serve the Prophet’s personal comfort rather than any divine or communal ethical ideal.Theological Analysis: Selfishness as an Unprophetic TraitTheologically, selfishness is universally recognized as a vice, not a virtue. In the Judeo-Christian tradition, selfishness is associated with sin and even with Satan. The Bible, for instance, teaches selflessness, hospitality, and generosity as marks of true godliness (see Matthew 25:35; Hebrews 13:2). By contrast, the characteristics described in both historical sources and the Qur’anic text attribute to Muhammad behaviors that contradict prophetic ideals.Selfishness is a trait of Satan, not of a true Prophet of God.Implications for Islamic TheologyIf the Prophet of Islam is depicted as greedy, never satisfied, and selfish—even necessitating divine revelation to shield himself from his own followers—how can such a figure serve as the model of righteousness for humanity? How does this comport with the Islamic claim that Muhammad was the best example (uswa hasana) for mankind (Qur’an 33:21)?Furthermore, the contrast with Jesus Christ is profound. Jesus is consistently depicted in the Gospels as generous, self-sacrificing, and inviting all—even to the point of washing his disciples’ feet (John 13:1-17) and feeding the multitudes (Matthew 14:13-21), never using divine revelation to serve his own convenience or personal comfort.ConclusionThe evidence from Islamic history and the Qur’an itself presents Muhammad as a prophet whose actions and revelations often served personal interests and comfort, not higher moral ideals. This challenges the claim of his moral perfection and raises serious questions for those who seek to follow him as the exemplar of human conduct.Selfishness and insatiability are not prophetic qualities, but rather marks of spiritual deficiency. If these are the characteristics of Muhammad, then serious reconsideration is required regarding his status as a prophet of the living God.To my Muslim friends, I ask: Can you truly claim that selfishness and personal comfort—traits more aligned with Satan than with the prophets—should be emulated as a model of divine life?References:Mohammed Riday,Kitabu cha Historia ya Mtume Muhammad, Mombasa, Kenya, p. 176.Qur’an, Surah Al-Ahzab 33:53.The Holy Bible, Matthew 25:35; Hebrews 13:2; John 13:1-17; Matthew 14:13-21.",

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThe claim that the Bible is both corrupted and yet useful as evidence for the Qur’an presents a logical and theological contradiction within Islamic apologetics. This article critically examines the practice of referencing the Bible within Islamic discourse, highlighting the inherent inconsistency and challenging Muslims to reconcile this contradiction in the light of their own scripture and theological framework.1. Introduction: The Paradox of Scriptural ReferenceIslamic polemics and apologetics frequently utilize the Bible as a reference to support the Qur’an or the prophethood of Muhammad. Yet, a central tenet in Islamic doctrine is the claim that the Bible (both Old and New Testaments) has been corrupted (tahrif). This raises a fundamental question:Why would Muslims quote from a text they consider unreliable, altered, and no longer trustworthy?The use of a “corrupt” text as authoritative evidence is, at best, problematic; at worst, it undermines the very foundation of the Islamic critique against Christian doctrine.2. The Qur’anic Position: Appeal to Previous ScriptureThe Qur’an itself addresses the relationship between the revelation given to Muhammad and the earlier scriptures:“So if you are in doubt, [O Muhammad], about that which We have revealed to you, then ask those who have been reading the Scripture before you.”(Qur’an 10:94)This verse is critical. It demonstrates that Muhammad is instructed to consult the “People of the Book”—Jews and Christians—about the authenticity and understanding of the Qur’anic message. If, at the time of Muhammad, the Bible was already corrupted, why would Allah direct Muhammad to seek verification or clarification from the possessors of a corrupted text? The Qur’an presupposes the reliability of the existing scriptures, at least at the time of its own revelation.3. The Hadith and Early Muslim AttitudesMuslim tradition, as seen in theHadith literature, reflects uncertainty regarding the use of previous scriptures:Narrated Ubaidullah: Ibn `Abbas said, \"Why do you ask the people of the scripture about anything while your Book (the Qur'an) which has been revealed to Allah's Apostle is newer and the latest?”(Sahih al-Bukhari Vol. 9, Book 87, Hadith 111)Here, Ibn Abbas criticizes the consultation of Jewish and Christian scriptures, suggesting the superiority and sufficiency of the Qur’an. This reveals an inherent tension in early Islamic thought: If the Qur’an is truly the final revelation and the Bible is allegedly corrupt, what possible apologetic value can there be in quoting the Bible to support Islamic claims?4. The Christian Position: The Integrity and Permanence of the BibleChristian theology asserts the incorruptibility and divine preservation of scripture:“All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness.”(2 Timothy 3:16)“Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will never pass away.”(Matthew 24:35)From a Christian perspective, the Bible is the unchanging, inspired Word of God. Its textual transmission and preservation are attested by historical manuscript evidence and the internal testimony of scripture itself. The claim of corruption is not only unsupported by historical evidence but also inconsistent with the Qur’an’s own references to the earlier scriptures as reliable.5. The Logical DilemmaThe act of quoting the Bible while denouncing it as corrupted is akin to using a broken compass to prove your map is accurate. If the Bible is truly unreliable, any appeal to its authority is self-refuting. Conversely, if the Bible is reliable, as the Qur’an initially affirms, then its testimony concerning the divinity of Christ, the crucifixion, and the gospel message must be seriously considered—yet these core doctrines are denied by Islam.Thus,Muslims are faced with a logical trilemma:If the Bible is corrupted, quoting it proves nothing.If the Bible is not corrupted, Islam must be judged by its witness.If Islam needs the Bible to validate itself but the two contradict, then the Islamic position collapses under its own inconsistency.6. Conclusion: An Invitation to ConsistencyFor meaningful interfaith dialogue and authentic theological inquiry, consistency is paramount. If Muslims truly believe the Bible is corrupted, they should refrain from quoting it as proof for Islamic claims. If they find the Bible reliable, intellectual honesty demands a serious engagement with its teachings—even when these challenge or contradict Islamic doctrine.“If the Bible is corrupted, stop quoting it. If it’s not, follow it.”ReferencesQur’an 10:942 Timothy 3:16Matthew 24:35Sahih al-Bukhari Vol. 9, Book 87, Hadith 111Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

However, Qur’an 33:53 (al-Ahzab) provides an intriguing case where the distinction between divine revelation and personal interests becomes blurred. A close reading exposes internal evidence that suggests Muhammad, rather than Allah, is the true author behind this verse.The Content and Context of Qur’an 33:53Qur’an 33:53(Sahih International translation):“O you who have believed, do not enter the houses of the Prophet except when you are permitted for a meal, without awaiting its readiness. But when you are invited, then enter; and when you have eaten, disperse without seeking to remain for conversation. Indeed, that was troubling the Prophet, and he is shy of you. But Allah is not shy of the truth…”Here, the verse is directed to the believers, instructing them on etiquette regarding the Prophet’s house. But a peculiar admission emerges:“Indeed, that was troubling the Prophet, and he is shy of you. But Allah is not shy of the truth.”This admission raises critical questions:Who is Troubled?The verse openly says it is Muhammad (“the Prophet”) who is troubled by people lingering in his house after meals.Who is Shy?The text admits Muhammad is “shy” about telling people to leave, but “Allah is not shy of the truth,” implying that Allah is supposedly intervening where Muhammad is too embarrassed to speak.Who is the Speaker?The style shifts abruptly from instructing the people, to explaining Muhammad’s feelings, then providing justification for what is presented as Allah’s direct words.Logical Analysis: Who is Really Speaking?A. The Human Element in Divine SpeechIf this verse is the word of Allah, then why does it center on Muhammad’s personal feelings (“he is shy of you”), his comfort, and his social awkwardness? Is it befitting for the eternal God to interrupt the flow of divine revelation to address the social discomforts of a single individual, especially in such a mundane context?B. The Speaker’s IdentityA logical reading asks: Who is narrating here? Is Allah narrating Muhammad’s emotions to the believers? Or is Muhammad, feeling shy to address his guests, claiming divine sanction for his personal need? The narrative voice becomes inconsistent—at times Allah, at times Muhammad’s own inner thoughts.C. The Absence of Universal ApplicationDivine revelation, in all monotheistic traditions, provides principles that are universal and transcend the prophet’s personal needs. Yet this verse is a personal solution for Muhammad’s inconvenience, not a moral or spiritual law.Theological Critique: Contradiction to Divine AttributesImpersonal Decree vs. Personal ConvenienceIf Allah is almighty, why would He reveal a verse simply to manage Muhammad’s household inconvenience?Does God become the mouthpiece for Muhammad’s personal comfort, or does Muhammad use God’s authority to resolve his own social anxieties?The Voice of the VerseThroughout the Qur’an, Allah speaks in the first person or commands via the second person. In this verse, the narrative switches awkwardly to comment on Muhammad’s emotions, something expected from a human narrator, not a divine one.Prophetic Model in Previous ScripturesNowhere in the Hebrew Bible or New Testament do we find God intervening solely to protect a prophet’s personal comfort from guests, let alone admit the prophet is too shy to speak. Prophets such as Moses, Elijah, or Jesus are often bold and forthright, their human needs never dressed up as divine revelation.The Critical QuestionIf this verse is truly Allah’s word, then why does it serve only Muhammad’s immediate, mundane need, and why does it admit the prophet is too shy to confront his own guests?Did Allah appear and directly speak to the people to resolve Muhammad’s shyness, or is this Muhammad himself, using “Allah” as a rhetorical tool to command respect and privacy?Who was actually speaking “mouth to mouth and face to face” to the people here? The verse suggests an observer aware of Muhammad’s emotional discomfort, which is inconsistent with a transcendent, omnipotent God.ConclusionBy examining Qur’an 33:53 in its literary, logical, and theological context, it becomes evident that this verse is best explained as Muhammad’s own words, articulated for his personal benefit and codified under divine authority. The verse reveals a human author who is too embarrassed to ask guests to leave, and thus attributes his wish to God. This raises profound doubts about the claim that the Qur’an is purely the word of Allah and not the word of Muhammad.Unless Muslims can demonstrate that it was truly Allah—speaking directly and not just Muhammad’s self-interest—who dictated this passage, the evidence from the verse itself remains damning:the Qur’an, at least in this instance, is the word of Muhammad, not the word of God.References:Qur’an 33:53 (al-Ahzab)Various classical and modern Islamic exegesis (tafsir)Comparative analysis with the prophetic voice in the BibleBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological Institute",

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis article critically investigates the claim of Allah’s omnipotence (all-powerful nature) within Islamic theology, focusing on the historical incident of Muhammad’s poisoning at Khaibar. It argues that the inability of Allah to prevent, heal, or answer the prophetic prayers of Muhammad undermines the assertion of Allah’s unlimited power. By scrutinizing the Islamic primary sources and theological claims, this report demonstrates that Allah’s power is, at best, a claim without consistent demonstrable evidence—particularly in the life and death of Islam’s own prophet.1. IntroductionThe doctrine of divine omnipotence is foundational to the concept of God in both Islamic and Christian theology. However, the real test of such an attribute is not merely in claims but in the historical and empirical manifestations of that power—especially towards the most favored and chosen prophets. In Islam, Muhammad is considered the “Seal of the Prophets,” and thus the manner of his life and death reflects directly on the character and ability of Allah. The poisoning incident at Khaibar (as recorded in multiple hadith sources) presents a severe challenge to the Islamic claim that Allah is all-powerful and attentive to the prayers of His prophets.2. The Incident at Khaibar: A Brief Historical AccountAccording to Sahih al-Bukhari and other major Islamic sources, after the conquest of Khaibar, a Jewish woman offered Muhammad poisoned meat (specifically, a roasted sheep). Muhammad consumed the meat, realized it was poisoned, and reportedly suffered lingering effects until his death years later.Sahih Bukhari 4428:\"When the Prophet was poisoned at Khaibar, he said: ‘I feel the effects of that poison from this very moment.’”(See also: Sunan Abu Dawood 4512, Sahih Muslim 5840.)Muhammad is reported to have prayed for healing, yet, the poison remained effective, ultimately contributing to his death. This fact is unambiguous in classical Islamic sources.3. Theological Implications: Allah’s Power in Question3.1. Why Didn’t Allah Save Muhammad?If Allah is all-powerful (Qur’an 2:20, 2:106, 6:61), why did He not prevent His final prophet from ingesting poison? The omnipotent deity, by definition, should have the capability to intervene in any circumstance—especially to protect His chosen messenger from harm. The failure to do so casts doubt on the absoluteness of Allah’s power.3.2. Why Did Muhammad’s Prayers Fail?The Qur’an repeatedly claims that Allah answers the prayers of His prophets:“When My servants ask you concerning Me, I am indeed close: I listen to the prayer of every suppliant when he calls on Me.”—Qur’an 2:186Yet, in the case of Khaibar, Muhammad’s supplications for healing were not answered. If even the greatest prophet’s prayers went unanswered, does this not suggest a limitation—either in Allah’s willingness, power, or both?3.3. Allah’s Inaction: Absence of EvidenceDivine omnipotence must be evidenced by consistent acts of deliverance and intervention, particularly for God’s own messengers. The Khaibar incident offers no such evidence, only a claim that is not substantiated by reality. Allah’s supposed power remains abstract, unmanifested in crucial moments.4. Comparative Theology: The Biblical God vs. AllahThe God of the Bible consistently demonstrates power by protecting, rescuing, and sometimes even resurrecting His prophets (Daniel 6:22, 1 Kings 17:21-22). Jesus, in particular, declares that He lays down His life of His own accord (John 10:18)—not at the mercy of human schemes or poison. The impotence of Allah in Muhammad’s final crisis stands in stark contrast to the Biblical model of divine omnipotence.5. The Omnipotence Claim: Philosophical and Logical Evaluation5.1. The Problem of Selective PowerA deity whose power is manifest only in select, unverifiable circumstances, but is absent in the most vital instances (such as the protection of His own prophet), cannot logically be called omnipotent.5.2. Internal Contradiction in the Qur’anWhile the Qur’an asserts Allah’s omnipotence, it also narrates stories where Allah’s power is either absent or conditional, contradicting the definition of absolute power (Qur’an 8:17 vs. 69:44-46).6. Conclusion: Allah’s Omnipotence—A Claim Without EvidenceThe incident of Muhammad’s poisoning exposes a critical flaw in Islamic theology. If Allah was unable (or unwilling) to save or heal his prophet, then Allah’s power is either limited or unreliable. This is not the mark of an omnipotent deity, but of a being whose power exists only in unsubstantiated claims and dogmatic assertions.A God who cannot, or does not, save His own messenger from such an ignoble and painful death cannot be trusted as all-powerful, nor as the true God worthy of ultimate allegiance.ReferencesSahih al-Bukhari 4428Sahih Muslim 5840Sunan Abu Dawood 4512The Qur’an: 2:20, 2:106, 6:61, 2:186, 8:17, 69:44-46The Bible: Daniel 6:22, 1 Kings 17:21-22, John 10:18By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

While many Muslim polemicists have accused Paul of corrupting the message of Jesus, an examination of classical Islamic exegesis, especially on Surah Ya-Sin (Qur’an 36:13-17), reveals a dramatically different tradition—one in which Paul (Bulus) is actually recognized as a messenger (rasūl) sent by Allah, associated with the Messiah (al-Masīḥ, i.e., Jesus). This article explores the evidence from primary Islamic sources—Qur’an, Tafsir, and Hadith—that confirm the respected status of Paul in early Islamic thought.1. Paul in the Qur’an and Tafsir Literature1.1 Qur’an 36:13-17: The Three Messengers to AntiochSurah Ya-Sin verses 13–17 narrate the story of a city that received three messengers, yet rejected them. The Qur’an itself does not name these messengers, but the major classical exegetes do.Your provided screenshot fromTafsir Ibn Kathir(see attached andonline reference) directly states:“The names of the first two Messengers were Sham‘un and Yuhanna, and the name of the third was Bulus (Paul), and the city was Antioch (Antakiyah).”– Ibn Kathir, Tafsir on Surah Ya-Sin 36:14.Bulusis the Arabic name for Paul, andAntakiyahis the Arabic for Antioch—a known center of early Christianity and a place historically associated with Paul’s missionary journeys (Acts 13:1-3). The same is confirmed in other tafsir works, such as Tafsir al-Tabari and Tafsir al-Qurtubi.1.2 The Messengers as Disciples of JesusThe exegesis further states:“Qatādah bin Di‘āmah claimed that they were messengers of the Messiah, peace be upon him, sent to the people of Antioch.”This directly contradicts the polemical view that Paul corrupted the message of Jesus. Instead, Paul is seen in these Islamic sources as a true emissary of Christ, appointed and sent to spread his message.1.3 Multiple Sources Confirming PaulOther Tafsir works:Tafsir al-Tabari (20:500):Echoes the names Sham‘un (Simon Peter), Yuhanna (John), and Bulus (Paul) as the messengers.Tafsir al-Qurtubi:Also narrates the story with the same names.Contemporary Islamic scholarsrarely mention this tradition, but it is clear that the earliest and most authoritative commentators on the Qur’an identified Paul as a genuine, divinely appointed messenger.2. Support from Hadith and Early Islamic Historians2.1 Historical Traditions (Akhbar)Early Islamic historians and hadith transmitters recorded similar narrations:Al-Tabari,Tārīkh al-Rusul wa’l-Mulūk(History of Prophets and Kings):“Jesus sent to Antioch two of his disciples, Simon and John. When they were opposed, he sent a third, Paul, to support them.”Ibn Ishaq (as cited by Ibn Kathir):The disciples of Jesus, who spread his message after his ascension, included Sham‘un (Simon Peter), Yuhanna (John), and Bulus (Paul), among others.2.2 Hadith LiteratureAlthough there is no direct sahih (authentic) hadith mentioning Paul by name as a disciple, numerous hadith collections affirm that Jesus had disciples (al-Hawariyyūn) who spread his message:Sahih Muslim 302:“The Prophet (Muhammad) said, ‘Both in this world and in the Hereafter, I am the nearest of all the people to Jesus, the son of Mary. The prophets are paternal brothers; their mothers are different, but their religion is one.’”This hadith, while general, supports the notion that the mission and succession of messengers after Jesus—including his disciples—were part of a continuous divine plan, which, as the tafsir shows, included Paul.3. Refuting the Polemic: Paul as “Corruptor” versus “Messenger”Modern Muslim polemicists, often unaware or dismissive of classical exegesis, assert that Paul corrupted the message of Jesus. However, the earliest and most authoritative Islamic sources held the opposite view:Paul isnamedandhonoredas a messenger of the Messiah.He is placed in the same category as Peter (Sham‘un) and John (Yuhanna), who are universally recognized as disciples of Jesus.The story is affirmed across multiple classical tafsir works and histories.This demonstrates a significant dissonance between early Islamic tradition and later polemical developments. Any assertion that Paul is absent or denigrated in Islamic sources is a distortion of the historical record.4. Archive and VerificationFor those who wish toverifythese claims, original sources are available:Tafsir Ibn Kathir Archive: See the section on Surah Ya-Sin, verses 13–17.QuranX Tafsir: English translation and commentary.Your attachedscreenshotprovides a faithful reproduction of the printed work, confirming this tradition for posterity.ConclusionThe evidence from the Qur’an, classical tafsir, and historical traditions unambiguously demonstrates that Paul (Bulus) is recognized as a legitimate messenger of Jesus in Islam’s earliest and most authoritative sources. Far from being a corrupter, Paul was understood to be amessenger of the Messiahto Antioch, working alongside Peter and John.This challenges both popular misconceptions within Islamic polemics and offers a basis for deeper interfaith dialogue. Scholars and students alike are encouraged to consult the primary sources and recognize the complex, interconnected legacy of Paul in the Abrahamic faiths.ReferencesTafsir Ibn Kathir, Surah Ya-Sin 36:13-17,QuranX.Tafsir al-Tabari20:500.Tafsir al-Qurtubi(on Surah Ya-Sin).Sahih Muslim, Book 30, Hadith 5836.Al-Tabari,Tārīkh al-Rusul wa’l-Mulūk.Ibn Ishaq, as cited in Ibn Kathir,al-Bidāya wa’l-Nihāya.Ibn Kathir Archive,Internet Archive.Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological Institute",

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThe traditional Islamic narrative asserts that Muhammad was “ummi”—often interpreted as “illiterate.” However, a careful reading of the Hadith and early Islamic sources presents a more nuanced and, at times, contradictory picture. This article critically examines the hadithic evidence concerning Muhammad’s literacy, evaluates the meaning of “ummi” in historical context, and addresses the theological implications of affirming Muhammad’s ability to read and write.IntroductionMuslim orthodoxy frequently holds that the Prophet Muhammad was illiterate, unable to read or write Arabic. This assertion, rooted in the term “ummi” as used in the Qur’an (Qur’an 7:157-158), is often cited as evidence of the miraculous nature of the Qur’an, believed to be revealed to an unlettered prophet. However, hadith literature and early Islamic historical sources provide compelling evidence challenging this claim. This article explores these sources, interrogating the theological and historical implications of Muhammad’s literacy.I. Linguistic and Contextual Analysis of “Ummi”The word “ummi” (أُمِّيٌّ) in Arabic traditionally translates as “illiterate” or “unlettered.” However, scholars such as W. Montgomery Watt and Alfred Guillaume have argued that “ummi” may refer to “gentile” (one who is not Jewish or Christian) or one not formally instructed in the scriptures, rather than simply illiterate (see Watt,Muhammad at Mecca, 1953).Qur’anic UsageThe Qur’an refers to Muhammad as “the unlettered prophet” (النَّبِيُّ الْأُمِّيُّ), but the same root is used in the Qur’an to describe “ummiyeen” (gentiles, or non-Jews) in 2:78. Thus, the term does not necessarily denote an inability to read and write.II. Hadithic Evidence: Muhammad’s Literacy1. Treaty of Hudaybiyyah: Writing His NameTheSahih al-Bukhari(2731; also see 3186, 4199, 4832) narrates that during the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah, Muhammad participated in the drafting of the document. When the Quraysh emissary objected to the title “Messenger of Allah,” Muhammad asked for the phrase to be erased. The narration in some versions states:“The Prophet took the document though he did not know how to write, and he wrote, ‘This is what Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, has agreed to.’”(Sahih Bukhari 3186, 4199, 4832; also Sahih Muslim 1784)Some narrations include, “The Prophet wrote,” and others clarify that he “asked Ali to write,” but the persistence of narrations where Muhammad himself “wrote” or made corrections is notable.2. Muhammad’s Signature and SealTheSahih al-Bukhari(4425) describes the Prophet’s use of a ring inscribed with “Muhammad Rasul Allah,” which he used as a seal for correspondence. InSahih Muslim(2092), it is stated:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) intended to write to the Persians, Romans, and Abyssinians. It was said, 'They will not accept any letter unless it is stamped with a seal.' So he took a silver ring and had (the words) Muhammad, Messenger of Allah engraved on it…”Here, the act of sending written letters is ascribed directly to Muhammad, with historical records indicating these letters were preserved and read by their recipients.3. The Incident at the DeathbedA famous episode inSahih al-Bukhari(114, 4431) recounts that as Muhammad lay dying, he asked for writing materials to record a statement:“Bring me a (pen and paper) so that I may write for you a statement after which you will not go astray.”This incident suggests familiarity with writing and the expectation that he could dictate or author documents.4. Hadith of Mu’awiyah bin Al-HakamSahih Muslim 537narrates a story of a slave girl, where Muhammad asks her, “Where is Allah?” and “Who am I?” Some versions of this hadith mention that Muhammad “wrote” (kataba) instructions or words, highlighting a potential for literacy.III. Early Islamic Historical AccountsIbn Ishaq’s SiraIbn Ishaq (d. 767 CE), in hisSirat Rasul Allah, narrates multiple occasions where the Prophet read, corrected, or dictated letters and contracts. There are also accounts of his business dealings in Mecca, which would have required basic literacy in record-keeping.IV. Theological ImplicationsMiraculousness of the Qur’anIf Muhammad could read and write, the apologetic argument that the Qur’an’s literary merit is miraculous due to his illiteracy is weakened. However, the miracle could then be ascribed to the substance and content of the revelation, not merely the mode.Integrity of TransmissionAcknowledging Muhammad’s literacy does not diminish the message but rather enhances the plausibility of accurate transmission of revelation, as the Prophet could oversee, review, and authenticate written documents.“Ummi” as GentileIf “ummi” means gentile rather than illiterate, then Qur’anic inerrancy is maintained, and the hadith evidence harmonizes with the historical context.V. Counterarguments and ReconciliationSome Muslim scholars argue that narrations suggesting Muhammad’s writing are metaphorical or refer to dictation. However, the prevalence and multiplicity of hadith mentioning his direct engagement with writing cannot be easily dismissed. The argument that Muhammad was initially illiterate but later learned to read and write is also present in some early tafsir (see al-Tabari, Tafsir al-Tabari, on Qur’an 29:48).ConclusionThe hadithic and historical evidence reveals that Muhammad’s relationship to literacy was more complex than traditional narratives suggest. Theological insistence on his illiteracy is not required by the evidence and may arise from later apologetic concerns. An honest reading of hadith and sira demonstrates occasions where Muhammad read, wrote, or corrected written materials. Reinterpreting “ummi” as “gentile” reconciles Qur’anic language with these traditions, suggesting that the Prophet Muhammad possessed at least functional literacy, a fact that aligns with his role as a statesman, leader, and communicator.ReferencesSahih al-Bukhari:Hadiths 2731, 3186, 4199, 4832, 114, 4431, 4425.Sahih Muslim:Hadiths 1784, 2092, 537.Ibn Ishaq,Sirat Rasul Allah, tr.

    "full_content": "A Scholarly and Theological CritiqueBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroduction: The Tenth Commandment in Biblical TheologyThe Tenth Commandment, as found in Exodus 20:17 and Deuteronomy 5:21, reads:“You shall not covet your neighbor’s house. You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, or his male or female servant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.”Coveting is fundamentally an issue of the heart—a desire for what rightfully belongs to another. This commandment is unique in its inward focus, emphasizing not just action but internal intent and desire. In Christian tradition, coveting is seen as the root of many outward sins, linking the Tenth Commandment to the spirit of all others.Islamic View: Desire, Possession, and Prophetic PrivilegeIslam, as taught in the Qur’an and Hadith, also warns against envy (hasad) and excessive worldly desire. However, the prophetic biography of Muhammad presents several narratives that raise important theological questions for interfaith dialogue. The core question is:Did Muhammad, as described in Islamic sources, transgress the heart and spirit of the Tenth Commandment?Debate Framework: Comparative AnalysisAffirmative Position: Evidence That Muhammad Broke the Tenth CommandmentThe Incident of Zayd and Zaynab (Qur’an 33:36-40)Biblical Parallels:The most direct challenge arises from Muhammad’s marriage to Zaynab bint Jahsh, formerly the wife of his adopted son, Zayd bin Harithah. Early Islamic sources (seeSahih al-Bukhari,Sahih Muslim,Tafsir Ibn Kathir) record that Muhammad saw Zaynab and was struck by her beauty. Subsequently, Zayd divorced her and Muhammad married her by divine command (Qur’an 33:37).Theological Critique:Critics argue this event exemplifies coveting another’s wife, violating the Tenth Commandment’s explicit prohibition. While Islam permits marriage after divorce, the sequence of admiration, divorce, and remarriage raises suspicion of covetous intent.Moral and Prophetic Example:In the Bible, King David’s coveting Bathsheba leads to condemnation and judgment (2 Samuel 11–12). Should not Muhammad, as the “Seal of the Prophets,” be held to the same moral standard?Prophetic Privileges and Possession (Qur’an 33:50)Sexual and Material Privileges:The Qur’an grants Muhammad unique privileges regarding women and property not afforded to other Muslims (Qur’an 33:50, 4:3; Hadith inSahih MuslimandSahih al-Bukhari). Critics claim these privileges reflect a desire for what others possess and institutionalize covetousness at the highest level.Envy or Divine Exception?Detractors argue that invoking divine sanction for personal benefit is a spiritual violation of the Tenth Commandment’s prohibition against covetousness.Spoils of War and Property (Qur’an 8:41; 59:6-7)Distribution of Spoils:Muhammad’s share of war spoils (fay’) is outlined in Qur’anic verses, often favoring the Prophet himself. Critics see this as further evidence of covetous acquisition, justified by revelation.Negative Position: Islamic Defense and ContextualizationIslamic Ethics on Desire and JusticeDistinction Between Desire and Action:Islamic jurisprudence distinguishes between fleeting desire (which is not blameworthy) and acting upon sinful covetousness. Defenders argue that Muhammad’s actions were governed by divine instruction, not personal greed.Marriage to Zaynab:Muslim scholars maintain that the marriage to Zaynab was divinely ordained to abrogate the Arab taboo against marrying an adopted son’s former wife, not driven by lust or covetousness. The Qur’an presents it as a legal reform, not personal desire (Qur’an 33:37).Prophetic Infallibility:Islamic theology posits the infallibility (ismah) of prophets, asserting that any act is by Allah’s will and beyond moral reproach by human standards.Differentiating Old Testament and Qur’anic LawNo Identical Prohibition:Some apologists assert that while the Qur’an warns against envy and injustice, it does not codify the Tenth Commandment as found in the Torah. Thus, Muhammad cannot be measured by Biblical standards alien to the Islamic worldview.Ethical Context:The socio-historical context of 7th-century Arabia differs from that of Israel under Moses. Actions taken by Muhammad must be understood within their historical and legal context.Critical Evaluation: Which Standard Applies?Universal Moral Law or Relative Ethics?The debate hinges on whether the Tenth Commandment represents a universal moral law binding on all true prophets, or whether prophetic actions are contextually exempt under new dispensations.The Problem of Prophetic Example:If Muhammad’s example contradicts the ethical standard given by previous prophets (such as Moses and Jesus), what does this say about his claim to be the final and greatest messenger?Spiritual Integrity:The commandment against coveting is ultimately about the alignment of the heart with God’s will. Did Muhammad, by his actions as preserved in Islamic tradition, demonstrate or contradict this standard?Conclusion: An Invitation to Further DialogueThis analysis, rooted in both scriptural comparison and historical critique, challenges the Islamic position on prophetic conduct and the integrity of Muhammad’s example regarding the Tenth Commandment. For Christians, the issue is not merely legalistic, but profoundly spiritual—centered on whether the prophetic heart reflects God’s character.Questions for Debate:Should Muhammad’s actions be judged by the ethical standards of the Ten Commandments?Do the incidents recorded in Islamic tradition constitute a breach of the Tenth Commandment?Is divine privilege a valid exemption from moral law, or does it expose a theological double standard?References:The Holy Bible: Exodus 20:17; Deuteronomy 5:21; 2 Samuel 11–12The Qur’an: 4:3, 8:41, 33:36-50, 59:6-7Sahih al-Bukhari,Sahih Muslim,Tafsir Ibn Kathir,Al-TabariJonathan A.C.

    "full_content": "A Theological and Scholarly CritiqueBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThe Eighth Commandment, found in Exodus 20:15, is a pillar of Judeo-Christian morality:“You shall not steal.”This commandment upholds the sanctity of private property, condemning theft in all its forms. The question arises: Did Muhammad, the founder of Islam, uphold this commandment, or do his actions and teachings—documented in Islamic sources—constitute a violation? This article explores this question in depth, inviting scholarly debate and comparative analysis.I. The Biblical Standard: The Eighth CommandmentThe commandment “You shall not steal” (Exodus 20:15; Deuteronomy 5:19) is unambiguous. In the Torah and throughout the Bible, theft is condemned, whether it is robbery, fraud, kidnapping (Exodus 21:16), or even withholding fair wages (Leviticus 19:13).Jesus affirmed this law(Matthew 19:18), and Paul warned: “Let the thief no longer steal, but rather let him labor, doing honest work with his own hands” (Ephesians 4:28). Property rights and respect for others' belongings are integral to biblical faith.II. Muhammad’s Actions in Light of the Eighth CommandmentA. Raids and Distribution of Spoils (Ghanima)Islamic historical sources describe Muhammad’s participation in caravan raids and battles, particularly after the Hijra to Medina.The Raid at Nakhla:Early Muslims, under Muhammad’s command, attacked a Meccan caravan during a sacred month, seizing goods and captives (Ibn Ishaq,Sirat Rasul Allah).The Battle of Badr and Distribution of Booty:After victory at Badr, Muhammad divided spoils among his followers and kept a portion for himself (Quran 8:1, 8:41;Sahih al-Bukhari 4273).Scholarly Debate:Defenders of Islamargue that these actions were not “theft” but acts of war, sanctioned by revelation, in the context of Arab tribal warfare.Critics and non-Muslim scholarsargue that, regardless of justification, seizing the property of others without consent constitutes theft by biblical and universal moral standards.B. Quranic Sanction for PlunderThe Quran addresses the question of spoils:“They ask you (O Muhammad) about the spoils of war. Say: The spoils are for Allah and the Messenger...” (Quran 8:1)“And know that whatever of war-booty that you may gain, verily one-fifth (1/5th) thereof is assigned to Allah, and to the Messenger...” (Quran 8:41)This institutionalizes the distribution of seized property. The Hadith further details how Muhammad allotted portions to his family and followers (Sahih Muslim 1758).C. The Case of FadakAfter the Jewish tribe of Banu Nadir was expelled from Medina, Muhammad took possession of their lands without battle (Sahih Muslim 1757). He also took the oasis of Fadak, which became his personal property.III. Theological Debate: Was This Stealing?A. The Islamic ViewMuslim theologians contend that:The context of war justifies seizure of enemy property.Actions sanctioned by “divine command” are not theft but legitimate spoils.The pre-Islamic Arabian context normalized raids.B. The Judeo-Christian and Universal Ethical PerspectiveThe commandment “You shall not steal” is absolute, not subject to context.Seizing property, land, or goods by force or without due process is theft, regardless of religious justification.Jesus and the apostles taught radical love for enemies, not plundering them (Matthew 5:44; Romans 12:17-21).C. Modern Scholarly AnalysisW. Montgomery Wattnotes, “The early Muslim raids, though justified in Islamic tradition, would be considered acts of brigandage by contemporary standards” (Muhammad at Medina, 1956).Alfred Guillaumehighlights the pragmatic and economic motivations behind the raids.IV. Case Study: The Execution of Banu Qurayza and Property SeizureAfter the execution of the Banu Qurayza, Muhammad and his followers divided the women, children, and property ([Ibn Ishaq,Sirat Rasul Allah];Sahih Bukhari 3043).Biblical Law:Condemns the unjust taking of property, even in war (Deuteronomy 20:10-15 sets standards for war but still expects mercy and restraint).Question:Can divine sanction be invoked for acts universally recognized as theft?V. Conclusion: A Call to Honest DebateDid Muhammad break the Eighth Commandment?Islamic tradition claims divine sanctionoverrides human law, but from the perspective of the Bible and universal ethics, the taking of property by force is theft.Christianity’s ethicforbids stealing, justifying violence or theft by divine right is rejected.Final Questions for Debate:Does divine command ever justify theft, or is the commandment absolute?Should morality be context-dependent or universal?If Muhammad is claimed to be a prophet in the biblical line, should his actions be held to the standard of the Ten Commandments?References:The Holy Bible (Exodus 20:15, Ephesians 4:28)The Quran (8:1, 8:41, 59:6-7)Sahih al-Bukhari, Sahih MuslimIbn Ishaq,Sirat Rasul AllahW.

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroduction: The Sixth Commandment in Judeo-Christian TraditionThe Sixth Commandment, as recorded in Exodus 20:13, is explicit:\"You shall not murder.\"This divine mandate stands as a cornerstone of Judeo-Christian ethics, emphasizing the sanctity and inviolability of human life. Jesus Christ, in affirming the Decalogue, reiterated the necessity of adhering to these commandments as a prerequisite for inheriting eternal life (see Matthew 19:16-19, Luke 18:18-20). When asked about attaining eternal life, Christ underscored,\"You shall not murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal...\"— making these commandments central principles of the Kingdom of God.Scholarly Investigation: Muhammad and the Violation of \"You Shall Not Murder\"This article examines, from a theological and historical perspective, how Muhammad—founder of Islam—stands in direct violation of the Sixth Commandment, not only by sanctioning but also by personally ordering acts of violence, murder, and brutality, including against the elderly and defenseless women.Case Studies from Islamic Sources1.The Killing of the Elderly: Umm QirfaAfter the conquest of the Kaaba, Muhammad dispatched his close companion, Zayd ibn Haritha, to suppress a tribe that had resisted conversion to Islam. Zayd’s forces attacked, capturing women and children, and specifically targeting the elderly:“We attacked them from all sides, fighting fiercely near their wells. We killed some of our enemies and took others captive. I saw a group fleeing, including women and children. I feared they would reach the mountain before me, so I shot an arrow, which landed in front of them, causing them to surrender. I herded them back like livestock.”(Sahih Muslim 4345)Among the captives wasUmm Qirfa, an elderly woman, who was executed in a gruesome manner. Zayd ibn Haritha ordered her execution by tying each of her legs to a camel and having the camels pulled in opposite directions, tearing her apart.(Ibn Ishaq/Hisham 980)Her daughter, Umm Qirfa Fatima, was taken as a captive and later gifted as a slave to Abu Bakr, then eventually claimed by Muhammad himself.(Sahih Muslim 4345)2.The Assassination of Abu Afak (Aged 120)Abu Afak, an elderly man (reportedly 120 years old), was killed for his poetry criticizing Muhammad’s actions in battle:Muhammad asked, “Who will deal with this rascal for me?” One of his followers volunteered and murdered Abu Afak in his sleep.(Ibn Ishaq/Hisham 995)3.The Killing of an Elderly MeccanAfter the conquest of Mecca, Muhammad reportedly ordered the execution of any non-Muslim who resisted Islam. TheSahih Bukharirecords:“The Prophet recited Surah Najm while lying down. The others did the same except for an old man who took a handful of earth and placed it on his head, saying, ‘This is enough for me.’ Later, I saw him killed as a disbeliever.”(Bukhari 19:173)Analysis: Theological and Ethical ImplicationsSuch actions, documented within respected Islamic sources, present a profound ethical and theological challenge. Unlike the teachings of Jesus—who rebuked violence and called for love even toward one’s enemies (Matthew 5:44)—Muhammad’s actions as chronicled in these incidents directly contradict the spirit and letter of the Sixth Commandment.The murder of non-combatants, the elderly, women, and critics—often in particularly brutal ways—cannot be harmonized with the commandment, “You shall not murder,” nor with the Christian moral tradition. Instead, these events expose a pattern wherein religious authority was used to justify acts that the biblical God, and Christ Himself, explicitly condemned.Further Scholarly ContextWhile some Muslim apologists attempt to contextualize or allegorize these events, the historicity of these incidents is affirmed in the earliest Islamic sources (Ibn Ishaq, Sahih Muslim, Sahih Bukhari). The consensus among historians and scholars of Islamic studies is that these acts were not only permitted but commanded by Muhammad, thus presenting a significant theological divergence from the ethics of the Decalogue.ConclusionIt is, therefore, evident that Muhammad, by both precept and example, violated the Sixth Commandment—\"You shall not murder\"—through his actions and directives involving the killing of the defenseless and elderly. This stands in stark contrast to the teachings and example of Jesus Christ and the foundational ethical code of the Judeo-Christian Scriptures.References:Exodus 20:13; Matthew 19:16-19; Luke 18:18-20Sahih Muslim 4345Ibn Ishaq/Hisham 980, 995Sahih Bukhari 19:173Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteFor Max Shimba Ministries Org ©2016.

    "full_content": "A Theological and Scholarly DebateBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThe Ten Commandments, central to the moral code of Judaism and Christianity, are considered by many as divine laws directly revealed by God to Moses on Mount Sinai. TheFourth Commandment, as found in Exodus 20:8, reads:“Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.” (Exodus 20:8, NKJV)This commandment was given not only as a religious ordinance but as an everlasting covenant (Exodus 31:16–17). It is a test of obedience and reverence towards God, with profound spiritual and communal implications.The Sabbath in the BibleThe Sabbath, observed from Friday sunset to Saturday sunset, is deeply rooted in the act of creation (Genesis 2:2–3) and reaffirmed in the Decalogue (Exodus 20:8–11; Deuteronomy 5:12–15). The Sabbath was intended as a day of rest, worship, and sanctification.Muhammad’s Stance on the SabbathThe Qur’an acknowledges the Sabbath:\"And you had already known about those who transgressed among you concerning the Sabbath, and We said to them, 'Be apes, despised.'\" (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:65, Sahih International)In this verse, Allah refers to a group among the Jews who violated the Sabbath, resulting in divine punishment. The Qur’an recognizes the sanctity of the Sabbathbutparadoxically, neither Muhammad nor his followers observed the Sabbath as a holy day. Instead, Islam institutedFriday (Jumu'ah)as the special day of communal prayer (Qur’an 62:9).The Shift from Sabbath to Jumu'ahIslamic tradition holds that the \"best day\" is Friday, not Saturday (Sahih Muslim 854). This deliberate move is not found in the Torah, the Prophets, nor the New Testament, where Jesus Himself kept the Sabbath (Luke 4:16).Debate Point:If the Sabbath was never abrogated in Scripture and was reinforced by the prophets and Jesus, what theological basis did Muhammad have to nullify its observance and replace it with Friday?Scholarly and Theological Critique1.Consistency with Divine LawBiblical Consistency:The Sabbath is a sign between God and His people \"forever\" (Exodus 31:16–17). Nowhere in the Bible does God authorize a change of the Sabbath.Islamic Inconsistency:While the Qur’an rebukes those who break the Sabbath, Muhammad himself neither observed nor commanded the keeping of the Sabbath, instead creating a new sacred day. This constitutes a break from the pattern established by Moses and observed by Jesus.2.Historical PerspectiveJewish Tradition:The Sabbath is a perpetual covenant (see also Ezekiel 20:12, 20).Christian Practice:While some branches of Christianity moved worship to Sunday, this was centuries after Christ and is a subject of considerable theological debate (seeBacchiocchi, S.,\"From Sabbath to Sunday\", 1977).Islamic Rejection:Islam claims to be a continuation of Abrahamic faith, yet rejects the Sabbath—central to Abrahamic law—demonstrating a rupture rather than continuity.3.Qur’anic Admission of the SabbathIslam’s own scriptures testify to the seriousness of breaking the Sabbath (Surah 4:154, Surah 7:163–166), recounting the story of the Jews who were transformed into apes for Sabbath violations. Yet, Muslims today do not rest or worship on Saturday, nor did Muhammad command them to do so.Contemporary Questions for MuslimsIf Allah considered Sabbath-breaking a grievous sin, why do Muslims not observe the Sabbath?On what authority did Muhammad change the designated day of worship from Saturday to Friday?Can Islam be considered a faithful continuation of the Mosaic law when it abrogates or alters one of the Ten Commandments?Scholarly ReferencesBacchiocchi, S.From Sabbath to Sunday: A Historical Investigation of the Rise of Sunday Observance in Early Christianity. Rome: Pontifical Gregorian University Press, 1977.Samuele Bacchiocchi,Divine Rest for Human Restlessness, Biblical Perspectives, 1998.The Holy Bible, Exodus 20:8–11; Deuteronomy 5:12–15; Ezekiel 20:12, 20; Luke 4:16.The Qur’an, Surah Al-Baqarah 2:65, Surah An-Nisa 4:154, Surah Al-A'raf 7:163–166, Surah Al-Jumu'ah 62:9.Hadith Collections:Sahih Muslim 854; Sahih Bukhari 893.ConclusionThe evidence indicates that Muhammad broke the Fourth Commandment by neither observing nor commanding the observance of the Sabbath,thereby contradicting the eternal law given by God in the Torah. While Islam claims reverence for previous prophets, this fundamental departure raises theological and scholarly challenges about Islam’s claim to continuity with the Abrahamic tradition.Final Debate ChallengeIs it possible for a prophet who claims to restore the true faith to disregard such a central command of God, or does this action mark a significant theological deviation? Scholars and students of comparative religion must honestly confront this question in the pursuit of truth.Shalom,Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

    "full_content": "A Scholarly Challenge to the Quran’s Claims in Light of Pre-Islamic Gospel EvidenceBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThe Qur’an makes several assertions about Jesus (ʿĪsā) that are not only absent from the canonical Gospels but, in many cases, contradict the historical and textual evidence available from pre-Islamic Christian sources. Qur’an 19:30 presents Jesus as speaking from the cradle, declaring, “Indeed, I am the servant of Allah.” This article invites a rigorous academic debate and challenges Muslim scholars, apologists, and theologians to provideverifiable, pre-Islamic, non-Quranic textual exhibitswhere Jesus refers to himself as the \"servant of Allah,\" calls Allah his \"Father,\" or in any way substantiates the specific Islamic claims about his identity and mission.1.Text of Qur’an 19:30 and Its Claim“He [Jesus] said: ‘Indeed, I am the servant of Allah. He has given me the Scripture and made me a prophet.’”(Qur’an 19:30, Sahih International)This verse ascribes to Jesus the explicit statement that he is the “servant (ʿabd) of Allah” (عبد الله), a theological construct central to Islamic Christology. The same surah continues to outline Islamic teachings about Jesus, none of which are present in the Gospel record.2.The Challenge: Where in the Gospel Did Jesus Ever Say This?A. Examining the Pre-Islamic Christian TextsCanonical Gospels:In all four Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John), Jesus never uses the phrase “I am the servant of Allah.”The New Testament Greek uses “theos” (God), and Jesus consistently refers to God as “Father”—not as “Allah.”No passage records Jesus speaking from the cradle or making prophetic pronouncements as an infant (a motif unique to later apocryphal traditions and the Qur’an).Non-Canonical Early Christian Writings (Before Islam):No extant Gospel or apostolic tradition pre-dating the Qur’an contains the phrase “Jesus is the servant of Allah,” or Jesus calling God “Allah.”Early apocryphal texts (e.g., Infancy Gospel of Thomas, Gospel of James) include legendary infancy narratives but never use Islamic terminology, nor do they present Jesus as the “servant of Allah.”B. On the Use of “Allah” as God’s Name in Christian ScriptureThe term “Allah” is the Arabic rendering of “God,” but its theological content in Islam is distinct from the Judeo-Christian understanding of God as “Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.”In the earliest Syriac and Aramaic Christian communities, God is called “Alaha” (ܐܠܗܐ) or “Elohim” (אֱלֹהִים) but never “Allah” in the precise Qur’anic sense.C. Jesus’ Own Words About His Relationship with GodJesus refers to God as “Father” over 165 times in the New Testament (see John 5:17-18, Matthew 6:9, Mark 14:36).Jesus says, “I and the Father are one” (John 10:30).Jesus never says, “I am the servant of Allah.”Nowhere does Jesus refer to “Allah” as his Father.D. Historical and Linguistic IncongruitiesThe Quran’s retroactive ascription of Islamic terminology and concepts to Jesus is anachronistic, as the word “Allah” was not used in first-century Palestine by Jews or Christians in the way it is employed in Islam.The Gospels are rooted in a Jewish monotheistic context that used “Abba” (Father) and “YHWH” (the LORD), not “Allah.”3.Qur’an as an Ahistorical Rewriting? A Call for Muslim ExhibitsA. Challenge to Islamic ApologeticsIf the Qur’an is truly a continuation of prior revelation, there must bepre-Islamic, extra-Qur’anic, textual exhibitswhere Jesus explicitly makes these claims.Where is the evidence from any manuscript, papyrus, parchment, or Christian oral tradition prior to the 7th century that Jesus declared himself “the servant of Allah” or called Allah his Father?B. Review of Early Christian WritingsPatristic Writings:Church Fathers such as Ignatius, Polycarp, Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, and Tertullian, who were closest in time to Jesus and the apostles, never mention such words attributed to Jesus.Jewish Historical Records:Josephus and other first-century Jewish historians do not record Jesus making such declarations.Roman Sources:No Roman or Greek historian prior to Islam attributes to Jesus a servant relationship to Allah.4.Analysis: Are the Quranic Claims Fabricated?A. Fabrication or Borrowed Legends?The assertion that Jesus spoke as an infant is found only in late, non-canonical apocryphal texts (e.g., Arabic Infancy Gospel, written centuries after Christ and likely after the rise of Islam).The Qur’an’s depiction of Jesus often mirrors and sometimes modifies these legendary sources, which lack apostolic authority and were never recognized by mainstream Christianity.B. Theological ImplicationsInvented Testimony:If the Qur’an cannot produce a single pre-Islamic exhibit for its claims about Jesus, then it stands as a book promoting narratives unsupported by historical evidence.Contradiction of the Gospel Record:The core Christian confession about Jesus’ identity (as Son, not merely servant) is not only different but irreconcilable with the Islamic claim.5.Conclusion and Debate: The Qur’an as a False Doctrine Promoting InventionsA. SummaryNo pre-Islamic Gospel, canonical or apocryphal, records Jesus as the “servant of Allah.”No manuscript or oral tradition predating the Qur’an calls Allah the Father of Jesus, nor does Jesus call God “Allah.”The claims in Qur’an 19:30 and related verses have no historical, textual, or theological precedent outside of the Qur’an itself.B. The Scholarly ChallengeWe challenge Muslim apologists and scholars to produce:Any documented Gospel or historical Christian source written before the birth of Muhammad, containing Jesus’ own declaration as the “servant of Allah.”Any pre-Islamic Christian record of Jesus referring to Allah as his Father.Any verifiable, objective exhibit that supports the Qur’an’s claims about Jesus outside of Islamic scripture.If such evidence cannot be produced, it is intellectually honest and academically necessary to conclude:The Qur’an has fabricated claims about Jesus that are not rooted in history.Islamic Christology is built on retroactive invention, not revelation.Therefore, the Qur’an must be critically examined and exposed as a doctrine that promotes legends as truth, without verified historical evidence.ReferencesThe Holy Bible, New Testament (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John)Infancy Gospel of Thomas; Protoevangelium of James (non-canonical)Early Church Fathers: Ignatius, Polycarp, Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, TertullianJosephus, Antiquities of the JewsBruce, F.F.,The Canon of Scripture.Reynolds, Gabriel Said,The Qur’an and Its Biblical Subtext.Cragg, Kenneth,Jesus and the Muslim: An Exploration.By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteThis article is an open invitation to academic debate.

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThe phrase “weeping and gnashing of teeth” appears multiple times in the New Testament as a vivid warning from Jesus Christ Himself regarding the eternal fate of those who reject Him. While Muslims honor Jesus (Isa) as a prophet, Islam categorically denies His divine Sonship, atonement, and saving Lordship. This article challenges Muslims, in the spirit of academic and theological inquiry, to reconsider the claims of Jesus Christ in light of both biblical testimony and eschatological warnings, for the sake of their own eternal destiny.I. The Biblical Concept: Weeping and Gnashing of TeethIn the Gospels, Jesus repeatedly warns of a place or condition where there will be “weeping and gnashing of teeth” (Greek:klauthmos kai brugmos tōn odontōn) for those cast out of God’s kingdom:Matthew 8:12: “But the sons of the kingdom will be cast out into outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”Matthew 13:41-42: “The Son of Man will send out His angels… and will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.”Matthew 22:13;24:51;25:30: Similar warnings are repeated in parables and eschatological discourse.Luke 13:28: “There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, and yourselves thrust out.”The imagery is of deep regret, conscious torment, and exclusion from the presence and blessings of God. Theologically, it signifies the final judgment upon all who refuse to acknowledge and confess Christ as Lord (cf.Romans 10:9-10; John 14:6).II. Islamic Denial of Jesus’ Sonship and the ConsequenceThe Qur’an explicitly denies that Jesus is the Son of God (Qur’an 4:171; 5:72, 116), calling it “blasphemy” and equating it with shirk (associating partners with Allah). Yet, the Bible proclaims:“Whoever denies the Son does not have the Father either; he who acknowledges the Son has the Father also.” (1 John 2:23)“Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God.” (1 John 4:15)By refusing to confess Jesus’ divine Sonship, Muslims (and all others who deny Him) remain outside the covenant of salvation. The stark warning of Jesus is thus highly relevant:Unbelief leads to outer darkness, to “weeping and gnashing of teeth.”III. The Reality of Judgment and JehannamThe biblical concept of “weeping and gnashing of teeth” parallels the Islamic notion of Jahannam (Hell), described in the Qur’an as a place of fire, regret, and eternal punishment (Qur’an 2:206; 3:191; 39:16; 67:6-11). However, thekey differenceis the means of escape:In the Bible, salvation is by faith in Christ(cf.John 3:16-18).A. Jesus’ Exclusive Claim“I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.” (John 14:6)“Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.” (Acts 4:12)These words are exclusive and final. No prophet, ritual, or law can substitute for the redemptive work of Christ.B. The Universal CallJesus calls all, including Muslims, to come to Him:“Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.” (Matthew 11:28)The offer is open, but the warning is also clear: rejection brings everlasting regret and separation.IV. A Theological Challenge to Muslims: Re-Examine Your BeliefsHonest Inquiry: The Qur’an itself encourages seeking the truth and consulting the “People of the Book” (Qur’an 10:94; 5:47). Are you willing to examine the Gospels and the testimony of Jesus Himself?Historical Testimony: The New Testament, written within a generation of Jesus’ ministry, affirms His crucifixion, resurrection, and divinity—facts acknowledged by secular historians (Tacitus, Josephus) and early Christian martyrs.Salvation’s Assurance: Islam offers no assurance of forgiveness; the Bible offers full pardon and eternal life to all who confess Jesus as Lord and believe in their heart God raised Him from the dead (Romans 10:9-13).V. Invitation: Accept Jesus and Escape the Coming JudgmentThe warnings of “weeping and gnashing of teeth” are not mere metaphors, but solemn declarations from the mouth of Christ. For Muslims and all who have not yet confessed Jesus as the Son of God, the time for repentance is now.Dear Muslim reader, examine the evidence, seek the truth, and consider Jesus’ words:“He who believes in the Son has everlasting life; and he who does not believe the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.” (John 3:36)Confess Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior. Escape the destiny of regret and outer darkness. Enter into the joy, peace, and light of God’s Kingdom.ReferencesThe Holy Bible, New King James Version (NKJV)The Qur’an, translations by Yusuf Ali and Saheeh InternationalF.F.

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThe conventional Islamic narrative claims that Prophet Muhammad was “ummi,” usually translated as “illiterate.” This dogma undergirds much of the apologetic argument for the Qur’an’s miraculous nature, positing that an illiterate man could not have produced such a text unaided. However, a closer examination of canonical hadith literature challenges this assertion. Multiple authentic narrations—ranging from the famous deathbed incident to reported actions involving reading and writing—suggest that Muhammad possessed at least a basic proficiency in literacy. This article presents the evidence, explores the theological implications, and questions the motives for modern Muslim apologetic evasions of these sources.I. Introduction: The Myth of Muhammad’s IlliteracyMuslim tradition asserts the Prophet Muhammad could neither read nor write, citing the Qur’anic epithet “al-ummi” (الأمي). However, a thorough and honest reading of the hadith corpus exposes a more nuanced reality. Several narrations, considered authentic by major Islamic authorities, demonstrate both his ability to write and to command the written word. This article will analyze these hadiths and pose a theological challenge to the continued perpetuation of the illiteracy claim.II. Primary Hadith Evidence of Muhammad’s LiteracyA. The Deathbed Incident (Sahih al-Bukhari 114, 4431)One of the most explicit and frequently cited proofs of Muhammad’s literacy occurs during his final illness. Sahih al-Bukhari records:Narrated Ibn ‘Abbas:\"When the Prophet was on his deathbed and in the house there were men among whom was 'Umar ibn al-Khattab, the Prophet said, 'Come, let me write (أكتب / aktub) for you a statement after which you will not go astray.'\"(Sahih al-Bukhari, 114; also see 4431)The verb “aktub” here unambiguously means “to write.” The Prophet’s request for pen and paper implies he could physically write, not merely dictate. If he were genuinely illiterate, such a request would be absurd.B. The Slave Girl and Writing in Sahih Muslim (537)The narration of Mu’awiyah bin Al-Hakam involves a slave girl questioned by Muhammad:The Prophet asked her, “Where is Allah?” and “Who am I?” Some versions note that the Prophet “wrote” (kataba) instructions or words—again, directly associating Muhammad with the act of writing.(See Sahih Muslim 537; variant readings and commentaries)C. Muhammad’s Treaties and LettersMultiple hadith and early Islamic sources report that Muhammad sent written letters to the kings and rulers of his era, with his own seal. For example, Sahih al-Bukhari (Hadith 2938, 4424) reports:“The Prophet wrote (kataba) a letter to Caesar...”The consistent use of the verb \"kataba\"—meaning “wrote” rather than “dictated”—is linguistically significant. Even if scribes were involved, the Prophet’s engagement with writing and written correspondence demonstrates at minimum a familiarity with written language.D. The Treaty of HudaybiyyahSahih al-Bukhari 2731, 3183, 4195, and Muslim 1784 recount Muhammad's role in the writing of the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah. In some reports, the Prophet corrects scribes and is involved in editing the text, indicating at least some functional literacy.\"Take it out, erase it, and write: ‘This is what Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, has agreed with...’\"(Sahih al-Bukhari, 2731)III. Theological Debate: Why Elude the Evidence?If the Prophet could read and write, why has the doctrine of his illiteracy become so essential in Islam? Several theological motivations can be identified:To Bolster the Qur’an’s Miraculous Status:The doctrine claims the Qur’an’s literary excellence is impossible from an unlettered man, thereby proving divine origin.To Fulfill Misinterpreted Prophecies:Some claim “al-ummi” refers to a prophet foretold in the Torah as “the unlettered prophet.”To Shield from Christian and Jewish Critique:By portraying Muhammad as illiterate, apologists avoid accusations of scriptural borrowing from the Bible and Jewish texts.Yet the hadith evidence itself is undeniable and canonical. If Muslims trust the hadith for doctrine and law, why evade or reinterpret those that contradict a convenient narrative? Is faith so fragile that it must reject its own traditions to maintain apologetic coherence?IV. Additional Hadith and Historical EvidenceBeyond the above, further sources underscore Muhammad’s engagement with reading and writing:Signing and Stamping Documents:Muhammad’s personal seal was affixed to letters; reports indicate he supervised or sometimes wrote himself (see Ibn Sa’d, “Tabaqat,” and other sira literature).Reading Jewish Scriptures:Several traditions mention Muhammad reading or examining written documents from Jews and Christians, sometimes calling for them to bring their scriptures (see Sunan Abu Dawud 4449).V. Conclusion: The Call for Intellectual HonestyThe evidence from sahih hadith and early Islamic tradition compels us to admit the strong likelihood that Muhammad possessed at least basic literacy. The continued denial of this fact—despite authentic narrations—is a distortion of Islamic history for apologetic purposes. If faith is based on truth, then the tradition must confront its own sources with honesty.Questions for Muslim Apologists:Why are these explicit hadiths elided or explained away in modern discourse?If the Prophet could write, what is lost for Islamic faith? Or is the fear that such admission would undermine cherished dogma?Should not the true mark of faith be the courage to follow the evidence, even when it challenges tradition?ReferencesSahih al-Bukhari 114, 4431, 2731, 3183, 4195Sahih Muslim 537Sahih al-Bukhari 2938, 4424Sunan Abu Dawud 4449Ibn Sa’d, “Tabaqat al-Kubra”Other canonical hadith and early Islamic historiographyBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteFor theological inquiry and critical engagement with Islamic tradition.",

However, the Prophet of Islam—Muhammad—never once spoke to God. This fundamental difference raises a pressing question: if Muhammad never conversed with the One who allegedly sent him, how can his claim to prophethood be trusted?Let us consider the biblical standard for a prophet:Prophets Who Spoke Directly With GodMoses–“God called to him from within the bush, ‘Moses! Moses!’”(Exodus 3:1-21)Elijah– Engaged in conversation with God repeatedly (1 Kings 19, entire chapter).Jeremiah–“Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you...”(Jeremiah 1:5)Jonah–“The word of the Lord came to Jonah a second time...”(Jonah 3:2)Paul– The Lord Jesus appeared and spoke to Paul (Acts 18:9); Paul affirms his apostleship as being “sent, not from men nor by a man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead” (Galatians 1:1).Scripture is clear: every biblical prophet had direct, personal encounters with God. Paul himself was chosen, called, and sent by God—not by a mere intermediary.Romans 1:1– “Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle and set apart for the gospel of God.”Contrast this with Muhammad, who—according to Islamic sources—received his messages not from God Himself, but through the angel Jibril (Gabriel). Even the Qur’an and Hadith literature admit: Muhammad never met or spoke with Allah directly.The Disturbing Origins of Muhammad's “Prophethood”Let us examine Muhammad’s background as recorded in Islamic sources:1. His Birth and Early LifeAccording to Abu Huraira, “The Prophet Muhammad was accompanied by a devil since birth” (Fat’hul Baary, Vol. 6, p. 389). Is there any evidence that this demon was cast out? If so, Muslims should present it.2. His First “Revelation” in the CaveWhen Muhammad first received his “call” in the cave, he was seized with terror and ran to his wife, Khadija, confessing he feared for his mind and sanity, and that he was being afflicted by evil spirits (SeeThe Life of Prophet Muhammadby Sheikh A. Farsy, p. 17).Questions:If Gabriel came from Allah, why did Muhammad believe he was tormented by demons after this encounter?Why did Muhammad confess that Gabriel confused and disturbed his mind?3. His Experience with SorceryMuhammad’s wife Aisha narrated that a Jewish man named Labiid bin Al’answan cast a spell on Muhammad, causing him to hallucinate and behave irrationally (Sahih Muslim, Vol. 4, pp. 38-39).Questions:Can a true prophet of God be bewitched and lose control of his faculties?Where was Allah when Muhammad was bewitched?Where is the record of deliverance from this spell?The Unique and Problematic Nature of Muhammad’s ProphethoodIs it reasonable to believe that God, the Sovereign Creator, would appoint a messenger whose life was so entangled with demonic oppression, confusion, and sorcery? No biblical prophet ever displayed such characteristics or confessed such experiences.Key Differences:Muhammad never spoke directly to the God who supposedly sent him.He was accompanied by a demon from birth (according to Hadith).He confessed to being afflicted by demons at the onset of his prophethood.He admitted to being mentally disturbed and manipulated by spirits.He acknowledged being bewitched and incapacitated by sorcery.If any prophet or apostle in the Torah, Psalms, or Gospel exhibited such disturbing traits, let Muslims produce the evidence. None exists.Conclusion: Only Jesus is the True WayDear reader, Muhammad does not qualify as a true prophet of God according to biblical standards. I invite you to turn to Jesus Christ, the only Way, the Truth, and the Life—the only one through whom we can truly approach the living God.Shimba Theological InstituteDr. Maxwell ShimbaMax Shimba MinistriesFeel free to use or adapt this post for your theological blog or publications.",

While many Muslims today reject Paul’s apostleship, claiming he was a false teacher and not a true messenger, this perspective is both theologically and historically uninformed. By examining the Scriptures—both the Bible and the Qur’an—as well as classical Islamic scholarship and the hadith, we can gain a deeper understanding of Paul’s divine mission.How Do Messengers Receive Revelation?We begin with the foundational understanding of how prophets and apostles receive divine revelation. InNumbers 12:6, the Almighty declares the nature of prophetic communication. Was Paul among those who received revelation in such a manner?Acts 16:9tells us, \"During the night Paul had a vision...\" Clearly, Paul was a recipient of divine visions, aligning with the criteria for messengers outlined in the Hebrew Scriptures.To Whom Was Paul Sent?God explicitly states Paul's commission inActs 9:15:\"But the Lord said to Ananias, 'Go! This man is my chosen instrument to proclaim my name to the Gentiles and their kings and to the people of Israel.'\"Further confirmation is found inActs 13:2:\"While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, 'Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.'\"Paul himself affirms his apostleship inGalatians 1:1:\"Paul, an apostle—sent not from men nor by a man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead.\"And again inColossians 1:1:\"Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother.\"Here, Paul stands firm, not as a self-appointed leader, but as one commissioned directly by Christ and God Himself.The Requirement of Faith in All MessengersIslamic faith, as summarized in the classical creed (Swifat ul I’iman Mufaswalu), is built on six articles:Belief in AllahBelief in His AngelsBelief in His BooksBelief in His MessengersBelief in Divine DestinyBelief in the Last DayOur focus is on the fourth article: faith in the messengers. Islam teaches there have been approximately 124,000 prophets, but only 25 are explicitly mentioned in the Qur’an.Surah 4:164states:\"Of some messengers We have already told you the story; of others We have not—and to Moses Allah spoke directly.\"Surah 2:136likewise commands:\"Say: 'We believe in Allah and what has been sent down to us and what was sent down to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the descendants, and what was given to Moses and Jesus, and what was given to the prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and to Him we submit.'\"Paul himself, as he testifies inPhilippians 3:5, was an Israelite of the tribe of Benjamin—a direct descendant of Jacob (Ya’qub). Therefore, the Qur’an implicitly includes Paul among those whom Muslims are called to respect as a true messenger.The Testimony of the Qur’an and the Early Muslim ScholarsIt is crucial to recognize that the rejection of Paul as an apostle is a recent development in Islamic polemics. InSurah 36:13-14 (Ya-Sin), we read:\"And set forth to them the parable of the people of the city, when the messengers came to it. When We sent to them two messengers, but they denied them both, so We strengthened them with a third; and they said, 'Indeed, we have been sent to you as messengers.'\"Many respected Qur’anic commentators, such as Sheikh Balwani and Yusuf Ali, identify this city asAntiochand name the three messengers as John, Simon, and Paul (Yuhanna, Shim‘on, and Boulos). Ibn Kathir, a renowned Islamic scholar, affirms in his tafsir (Qur’anic commentary) that these messengers, including Paul, were sent to the people of Antioch.Additionally, in Ibn Hisham’s biography of the Prophet Muhammad (Sirat Nabawiya, vol. 4, p. 140), the Prophet is recorded as listing Paul among the apostles of Jesus, specifically sent to the Romans.The Qur’an’s Directive for GuidanceWhen Muslims have doubts regarding matters not explicitly detailed in the Qur’an, they are instructed inSurah 10:94:\"So if you are in doubt about that which We have revealed to you, then ask those who have been reading the Scripture before you...\"Thus, the Qur’an itself encourages Muslims to consult the People of the Book—Jews and Christians—about the prophets, most of whom are found in the Bible.Conclusion: Rejecting Paul is Rejecting the FaithRejecting Paul’s apostleship is not only a departure from biblical revelation but also from the plain teachings of the Qur’an and classical Islamic scholarship. To oppose Paul is to oppose the faith itself and, ultimately, to challenge the wisdom of God. Satan uses subtle snares to divert believers from the truth. Instead of following contemporary polemics, we are called to heed the testimony of Scripture, the guidance of the Qur’an, and the consensus of early Muslim scholars.Shalom.This theological reflection affirms that both the Bible and the Qur’an, along with the earliest Islamic scholars, recognize the apostleship of Paul. Contemporary opposition is a modern innovation, not rooted in sacred Scripture or tradition.",

Abstaining from pork and unclean foods was commanded for all Israelites long before Islam existed.Key Point:Jesus followed Jewish kosher laws, not Islamic halal laws. Kosher pre-dates halal by over a millennium.Furthermore, in Mark 7:18-19, Jesus began to reveal that it is not food but what comes from the heart that defiles a person. This shift is entirely non-Islamic.(2)Was Jesus Circumcised According to Islamic Custom?Muslim Claim:Muslims highlight that Jesus was circumcised, a practice also found in Islam.Biblical Truth:Jesus was circumcised on the eighth day (Luke 2:21), in fulfillment of the covenant God made with Abraham (Genesis 17:10-12), as all Jewish males were.Key Point:Circumcision is a sign of the Abrahamic covenant, not a marker of Islam. It is foundational to Jewish identity and predates Islam by two thousand years.(3)Is “Messiah” Just Another Term for Prophet in Islam?Muslim Claim:Islam acknowledges Jesus (Isa) as al-Masih (the Messiah), but only as a prophet, not the divine Son of God.Scriptural Reality:In the Bible, “Messiah” (Hebrew:Mashiach, Greek:Christos) means “Anointed One,” and refers to the Savior promised to Israel, not merely a prophet.Key Point:Jesus fulfilled specific Messianic prophecies (see Isaiah 9:6, Micah 5:2, Daniel 9:25-26).The New Testament presents Jesus as Son of God and Redeemer, not just a messenger (see John 1:1-14, John 20:31).The Quranic “Isa” is fundamentally different from the Jesus of the Bible, stripped of His divinity, atoning death, and resurrection.Accepting Jesus only as a prophet is to deny His true identity and mission.Summary and Final ThoughtsJesus’dietary practicesandcircumcisionwere thoroughly Jewish, rooted in the Torah, not in later Islamic law.Thetitle “Messiah”is deeply Messianic and redemptive in the Bible—far beyond the Islamic concept of a prophet.Islamic attempts to appropriate Jesusrely on retroactive claims and redefinitions that strip Him of His biblical identity and mission.Jesus is the Messiah, Son of God, and Savior—not a Muslim prophet.Shalom,Dr Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

    "full_content": "THE ISLAMIC DILEMMA: A THEOLOGICAL AND HISTORICAL ANALYSISBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThe interplay between the Qur’an and the Gospels presents a significant theological conundrum within Islam, often referred to as the “Islamic Dilemma.” This dilemma centers on the Qur’an’s affirmation of the previous Scriptures—specifically the Gospel (Injil)—and its subsequent contradictions with the actual teachings found within those Scriptures. This article critically examines the dilemma, referencing Islamic texts, Christian scriptures, and scholarly interpretations to demonstrate the theological and logical inconsistencies inherent in Islamic claims regarding the integrity and authority of the Gospels. The analysis further exposes the resultant predicament for Muhammad and Islamic doctrine.1. IntroductionIslamic theology claims continuity with the Abrahamic tradition, asserting that Allah revealed the Torah to Moses, the Psalms to David, the Gospel to Jesus, and the Qur’an to Muhammad. This claim, however, is fraught with contradictions when the actual content of the Gospels is compared with Islamic doctrine. The \"Islamic Dilemma\" emerges from the Qur’an's simultaneous affirmation and rejection of the foundational Christian claims about Jesus Christ.2. The Qur’an’s Affirmation of the GospelThe Qur’an repeatedly affirms that the Gospel was revealed by Allah as a source of guidance and light:Surah 3:3:“He has sent down upon you, [O Muhammad], the Book in truth, confirming what was before it. And He revealed the Torah and the Gospel.”Surah 5:46:“And We sent, following in their footsteps, Jesus, the son of Mary, confirming that which came before him in the Torah; and We gave him the Gospel, in which was guidance and light and confirming that which preceded it of the Torah as guidance and instruction for the righteous.”Surah 5:47:“So let the people of the Gospel judge by what Allah has revealed therein.”Here, the Qur’an not only recognizes the Gospel as divinely inspired but commands Christians to judge by it, suggesting the Gospel’s continued validity during Muhammad’s era.3. The Contradictions: Christology in the Gospels vs. the Qur’an3.1. Jesus in the GospelsThe Gospels emphatically declare the divinity and sonship of Jesus Christ:John 8:58:“Before Abraham was, I am.”Mark 3:11:“Whenever the impure spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, ‘You are the Son of God.’”John 1:1, 14:“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God… The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us.”3.2. Jesus in the Qur’anIslam categorically denies the divinity and sonship of Christ:Surah 4:171:“The Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, was no more than a messenger of Allah... So believe in Allah and His messengers, and do not say ‘Three’; desist—it is better for you. Allah is only one God. Far be it from His glory that He should have a son.”Surah 5:72:“They have certainly disbelieved who say, ‘Allah is the Messiah, the son of Mary’… Allah has forbidden him Paradise, and his refuge is the Fire.”Thus, while the Gospel proclaims Jesus as God and the Son of God, the Qur’an rejects these central Christian tenets. This irreconcilable contradiction is at the heart of the Islamic dilemma.4. The Islamic Response: Corruption TheoryFacing this contradiction, Muslim apologists typically assert that the Gospels have been corrupted (tahrif). Yet, the Qur’an explicitly states:Surah 6:115:“And the word of your Lord has been fulfilled in truth and in justice. None can change His words...”Surah 18:27:“And recite what has been revealed to you of the Book of your Lord. None can change His words…”If, according to the Qur’an, none can alter the words of Allah, it becomes theologically incoherent to argue that the Gospel—which the Qur’an recognizes as Allah’s Word—has been corrupted.Furthermore, the Qur’an challenges the Jews and Christians to judge by their own scriptures (Surah 5:47, 5:68), implying the continued authenticity of these texts during Muhammad’s time.Manuscript EvidenceModern textual criticism reveals that the manuscripts of the Gospels predate Muhammad by centuries, and there is no evidence of a widespread post-Christian corruption. The content Christians had in the 7th century is virtually identical to what exists today. (See Bruce Metzger,The Text of the New Testament, and F.F. Bruce,The Canon of Scripture.)5. The Lost Gospel ArgumentSome Muslims contend that the original Gospel was lost. However, the Qur’an itself contradicts this notion by referencing the Gospel in the possession of Christians at the time of Muhammad, commanding them to judge by it:Surah 5:47:“So let the people of the Gospel judge by what Allah has revealed therein.”This passage presupposes the accessibility and authenticity of the Gospel among the Christian communities of the 7th century.6. The Muhammad Dilemma: The Prophet’s Reliance on the GospelMuhammad’s references to the Gospel and his affirmation of its authority raise serious theological dilemmas. If the Gospel was corrupted or lost, then Muhammad’s command to Christians to follow it becomes either ignorant or deceptive—attributes inconsistent with prophethood. If the Gospel was intact and true, then Islam’s denial of its central message (Christ’s divinity, crucifixion, and resurrection) renders Islam a self-contradictory faith.7. Logical Flow of the DilemmaIf the Gospels are true:Islam is false, because its core claims contradict the Gospel (e.g., Christ’s divinity and atonement).If the Gospels are false:The Qur’an is false, because it affirms the Gospels as revelation.If the Gospels are corrupted:The Qur’an is false, because it teaches no one can change Allah’s words.If the Gospels are lost:The Qur’an is false, because Muhammad affirmed the existence and validity of the Gospel among Christians of his time.Either way, Islam cannot stand without undermining its own foundational claims.8. Conclusion: The Inescapable DilemmaThe so-called “Islamic Dilemma” is an unavoidable theological predicament for Islam and for Muhammad as its prophet. If the Qur’an is to be believed, the Gospels were once the Word of God, but their content irreconcilably contradicts Islamic doctrine. The standard Muslim response—the corruption theory—lacks Qur’anic support and is refuted by manuscript evidence. The only resolution for Muslims is to reject either the integrity of their own scripture or the legitimacy of Christian claims, but not both.The academic and theological challenge is clear: Islam cannot both affirm and deny the Gospel. Any attempt to reconcile the two results in internal contradiction, exposing the dilemma of Muhammad’s teaching and, by extension, the doctrinal integrity of Islam itself.ReferencesThe Qur’an: Surahs 3:3, 4:171, 5:46-47, 5:68, 6:115, 18:27The Bible: John 1:1, 1:14, 8:58, Mark 3:11Metzger, B.

Yale University Press.Sahih Muslim, Book 1, Hadith 367 (affirming Gospel as revelation).For further study, students are encouraged to examine primary source manuscripts, the history of textual transmission, and patristic references to the Gospel predating Islam. The tension between the Qur’an’s recognition of the Gospel and its rejection of Christian doctrine remains a profound theological and historical challenge for Islamic apologetics.By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

Such a report is not merely a matter of historical curiosity; it stands as a profound theological concern that raises serious questions about Muhammad’s claim to prophethood and his representation of the Almighty God.Translation of the Original StatementThe honorable Prophet (s.a.w.w.) set his eyes upon and lusted after another man’s wife (a married woman) (Na’uzubillah—God forbid). [Tafsir Fath al-Qadir, Volume 4, page 404]Theological Expansion and CritiqueThe behavior attributed to Muhammad in this account starkly contrasts with the character of God as revealed in the Scriptures. The God of the Bible is holy, just, and pure—He abhors covetousness, adultery, and every form of moral compromise. The Ten Commandments explicitly state: “You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife” (Exodus 20:17). Jesus further deepens this ethic by teaching, “Anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart” (Matthew 5:28).How then can a true prophet of the Almighty, one who claims to represent the will and character of the living God, act in direct contradiction to the most basic moral standards set by God Himself? The prophets of the Bible, though human and fallible, were called to a higher standard of holiness, serving as exemplars of God’s righteousness to His people. The very office of a prophet demands integrity, self-control, and an unwavering commitment to the commands of God.This account of Muhammad not only exposes a serious moral flaw but also undermines his prophetic credentials. It suggests that Muhammad’s behavior was guided by personal desire rather than by the Spirit of the Most High. Such conduct cannot be reconciled with the nature of God, who is described as “of purer eyes than to behold evil and cannot look on wickedness” (Habakkuk 1:13).Furthermore, this episode stands in stark contrast to the character of Jesus Christ, who not only resisted temptation but also taught and modeled the highest standards of sexual purity and sacrificial love. Jesus never desired what belonged to another, nor did He seek to gratify His flesh at the expense of God’s commandments. His life was the perfect reflection of the holiness of God, making Him the true and ultimate Prophet, Priest, and King.ConclusionThe incident of Muhammad coveting another man’s wife, as preserved in Islamic sources, is not a trivial matter. It is one of many evidences that Muhammad’s life and teachings do not reflect the holiness, love, and justice of the Almighty God. Rather, it exposes him as a man led by personal passions, and thus, by biblical standards, a false prophet. As Christians, we are called to discern the true from the false by examining the fruit and character of those who claim to speak for God (Matthew 7:15-20; 1 John 4:1).For this reason, Muhammad cannot be regarded as a true messenger of the Most High, for his actions fail to manifest the unblemished holiness and righteousness that are the very essence of the Almighty.References:Tafsir Fath al-Qadir, Volume 4, p. 404Exodus 20:17Matthew 5:28Habakkuk 1:13Matthew 7:15-201 John 4:1If you want this adapted for other uses (infographic, debate, or a book chapter), let me know!",

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis article explores the biblical Second Commandment in relation to Islamic ritual and tradition as established by Muhammad. By engaging biblical, Qur’anic, and Hadith sources, as well as critical academic scholarship, the discussion seeks to demonstrate that several core Islamic rituals represent a continuity of pre-Islamic idolatrous practice, thereby constituting a violation of the Second Commandment from a Judeo-Christian theological perspective. This analysis is contextualized within the history of religions and comparative theology.IntroductionThe Second Commandment, which prohibits the making and veneration of images or physical objects in worship (Exodus 20:4-5; Deuteronomy 5:8-9), is fundamental to biblical monotheism. The command is clear and categorical:\"You shall not make for yourself a carved image... You shall not bow down to them nor serve them\" (Exodus 20:4-5, NKJV).Historically, the struggle against idolatry is a central theme in the Old Testament (e.g., Leviticus 26:1; Deuteronomy 27:15; 2 Kings 17:12-16; Isaiah 44:9-20; Jeremiah 10:1-16). The New Testament continues this prohibition, warning that \"flee from idolatry\" (1 Corinthians 10:14; cf. Acts 17:29-30; 1 John 5:21).In contrast, Islamic tradition, as practiced in the rites of the Hajj and Umrah, enshrines certain acts—such as circumambulating, kissing, and bowing before the Black Stone (Hajar al-Aswad), and the Sa’i between Safa and Marwah—which are both physical and symbolic. This essay interrogates these rituals in light of the Second Commandment and argues that they constitute a form of religious syncretism and a re-adoption of pre-Islamic Arabian religiosity.Islamic Rituals: Continuity With Pre-Islamic Practices1.The Black Stone (Hajar al-Aswad)The Black Stone embedded in the eastern corner of the Kaaba is not only touched and kissed by millions of Muslim pilgrims but also given special veneration. The Hadith literature confirms this as a sunnah of Muhammad:\"I saw the Messenger of Allah touch the (Black) Stone and then place his lips on it and wept for a long time.\" (Sunan Ibn Majah 2944; cf. Sahih Bukhari 1520).Further, the Prophet is reported to have said, “Touching them (the Black Stone and the Yemeni Corner) atones for sins” (Tirmidhi 959; Ibn Majah 2950). This confers a redemptive value to the act, transforming it from a symbolic gesture to one of theological import.Historical Origins:Prominent Islamic historians, such as Al-Azraqi (Akhbar Makkah, 9th c.), and Western scholars (Patricia Crone, Gerald Hawting), document that the Black Stone and the Kaaba were objects of veneration in Arabia centuries before Muhammad. Al-Azraqi notes that pagan Arabs performed tawaf and touched the Black Stone, regarding it as a sacred relic.W. Montgomery Watt, inMuhammad at Mecca(1953), writes:“Most of the features of the pre-Islamic pilgrimage were retained by Islam, with only slight modifications.”Similarly, Karen Armstrong inIslam: A Short History(2000), admits:“Many of the customs associated with the Hajj, such as running between Safa and Marwah and the stoning of the devil, were pre-Islamic.”2.The Ritual of Sa’i: Safa and MarwahThe Qur’an (2:158) validates the running between Safa and Marwah, describing them as “symbols of Allah.” Yet, these hills were ancient sites of idol worship. As documented in Sahih Bukhari (vol. 2, hadith 711), the Companions themselves were uncomfortable with these rituals because of their association with Jahiliyyah (the Age of Ignorance), but were reassured by Muhammad.As Karen Armstrong further observes:“Even though the idols were removed, the sites themselves remained objects of veneration, given new religious meaning by Islam.”3.The Stoning of Satan at MinaThis act is based on the legend that Abraham was tempted by Satan at these spots and drove him away by throwing stones. The ritual is found in both Hadith (Sahih Muslim 1219) and Sira literature. But, as John L. Esposito notes inIslam: The Straight Path(1998), such rituals are “pagan in origin, Islamized by the Prophet but essentially retained in their outward form.”Biblical Counterpoint:Christianity rejects the notion of combating spiritual evil through physical acts (Ephesians 6:10-18), instead emphasizing spiritual resistance through faith, prayer, and adherence to the word of God.Scholarly Arguments and Critical Perspectives1.Syncretism and Religious Innovation (Bid‘ah)Despite Islamic claims of pure monotheism (tawhid), Islamic practice displays unmistakable elements of syncretism. As G. R. Hawting argues inThe Idea of Idolatry and the Emergence of Islam(1999), the boundaries between monotheism and inherited Arabian religiosity in early Islam were far from clear.Ignaz Goldziher, a pioneer in Islamic studies, noted:“The Muhammadan cult… is based on a foundation of ancient heathen rites which were practiced by the Semitic races from time immemorial.” (Introduction to Islamic Theology and Law, 1981).2.Scriptural Contradictions and the Problem of AuthorityIslamic sources claim the Black Stone is from Paradise (Tirmidhi 877) and that it will testify for those who touch it on Judgment Day. This quasi-miraculous status attributed to a physical object is antithetical to biblical theology, which insists that no created object can mediate divine favor (Isaiah 44:9-20; Romans 1:21-25).3.Christian and Jewish ResponsesChristian theologians, such as John Calvin (Institutes of the Christian Religion, I.xi), condemned any form of physical object veneration as the essence of idolatry. Jewish sources likewise identify the worship or veneration of stones as abominations (Deuteronomy 16:22; Mishnah Avodah Zarah 4:5).Theological Assessment: Does Islam Break the Second Commandment?While Muslim theologians have vigorously denied any accusation of idolatry (shirk), the evidence indicates that:The veneration of the Black Stone, the circumambulation of the Kaaba, and ritual acts at Safa, Marwah, and Mina are all rooted in pre-Islamic idolatrous practices.These practices confer special status on physical objects, actions explicitly forbidden by the Second Commandment.As scholar Samuel Zwemer writes inThe Cross Above the Crescent(1941):“Despite Islam’s professions of aniconism, its pilgrimages and reverence for stones, tombs, and relics reveal a deep-seated tendency towards material mediators in worship.”Jesus Christ’s words in John 4:21-24 stand as the decisive Christian answer:“...the hour is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem... God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in truth.”Conclusion: Christian Engagement and Missional ImplicationsGiven the overwhelming evidence from both Islamic and non-Islamic sources, it is clear that Muhammad’s establishment of Islamic ritual was not a total rejection of idolatry but a transformation and rebranding of existing pagan customs. For Christians, the Second Commandment remains inviolable, and true worship is entirely detached from physical objects.The Christian’s dutyis to present this biblical truth compassionately and courageously to Muslims and others, inviting them to the pure worship of the living God through Christ alone (Romans 10:9-13; Acts 4:12).BibliographyThe Holy Bible (NIV, ESV, NKJV).The Qur’an (Yusuf Ali, Pickthall, Saheeh International translations).Sahih al-Bukhari, Sahih Muslim, Sunan Ibn Majah, Jami’ at-Tirmidhi.Guillaume, A.,The Life of Muhammad(Oxford University Press, 1955).Crone, Patricia,Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam(Princeton, 1987).Watt, W.

The third commandment, in particular, underscores the seriousness with which God’s name is to be treated:“You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain, for the LORD will not hold him guiltless who takes His name in vain.” (Exodus 20:7, ESV)This commandment has historically been interpreted as a prohibition against the misuse, trivialization, or profanation of the divine name, establishing a clear boundary between what is sacred and what is secular or profane.Jewish Perspective on the Divine NameIn Jewish tradition, the reverence for the name of God (YHWH) is paramount. The Tetragrammaton is considered so holy that it is not pronounced in daily speech, replaced instead with “Adonai” (Lord) or “HaShem” (The Name). TheMishnah(Sanhedrin 10:1) andTalmud(Kiddushin 71a) elaborate on the grave sin of blasphemy or casual usage of the divine name. Rabbinic tradition interprets Exodus 20:7 as not only forbidding false oaths but also prohibiting any irreverent use of the divine name (see:Rashion Exodus 20:7;Maimonides,Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot Yesodei HaTorah 6:2).Christian Theological ReflectionChristian tradition upholds the sanctity of God’s name. The Lord’s Prayer itself begins, “Hallowed be Thy name” (Matthew 6:9), underscoring the principle that God’s name is to be revered and sanctified in all circumstances.Martin Luther, in hisLarge Catechism, writes that this commandment forbids any use of God’s name for swearing, lying, or cursing, and demands that it be invoked only in truth, prayer, and praise (Luther,Large Catechism, I. 54-56).John Calvinfurther emphasizes that any “profanation” of the divine name, especially in contexts of violence or injustice, is an affront to the divine character (Calvin,Institutes of the Christian Religion, II.8.22).Islamic Practice: The Invocation of “Allahu Akbar”Contextual Use and MisuseIn Islam, the phrase“Allahu Akbar”(“God is Greatest”) is a central liturgical formula, used in daily prayers (Salah), call to prayer (Adhan), and various rituals. However, its use is not confined to worship but extends to moments of emotional intensity—including warfare, political protest, and, regrettably, acts of violence and terrorism.Notably, radical groups have weaponized this phrase, uttering it before and during violent acts, thus tying the divine name directly to human acts of destruction.Muhammad’s PrecedentIslamic sources attribute to Muhammad numerous injunctions to invoke “Allahu Akbar” in diverse situations—including battle (see:Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 2955;Sahih Muslim, Hadith 872) and moments of surprise or distress (Riyad as-Salihin, Book 17, Hadith 1320). This habitual invocation risks desacralizing the divine name by frequent and indiscriminate use, often detached from genuine reverence.Theological Critique1. The Principle of SanctityIf “Allah” is indeed the same as the God of Abraham, Moses, and Jesus, then His name must be treated with the same reverence asYHWHin Jewish and Christian traditions. Thecasual,political, orviolentinvocation of the divine name directly contravenes the principle of sanctity established in the Ten Commandments (cf. Leviticus 19:12; Ezekiel 36:21).2. Ethical ImplicationsThe biblical God consistently condemns the use of His name for false, manipulative, or violent ends (Jeremiah 23:25-27; Matthew 7:21-23). The invocation of “Allahu Akbar” during violence not only misrepresents God’s character but weaponizes the sacred for profane ends. As Old Testament scholarWalter Brueggemannnotes, the commandment “forbids trivializing the name of the God who is holy” (Brueggemann,The Book of Exodus, p. 865).3. Comparative TheologyWhile Islamic theology asserts the transcendence and uniqueness of Allah (tawhid), it lacks the strong biblical prohibitions against misusing the divine name. The Qur’an, while prohibiting false oaths (Qur’an 2:224), does not explicitly prohibit the casual or violent use of Allah’s name. TheHadithliterature even records Muhammad encouraging repeated invocation of God’s name in various secular contexts, further weakening the distinction between sacred and profane.Scholarly and Interfaith PerspectivesThe Problem of Religious Violence and the Divine NameContemporary scholars (e.g.,Miroslav Volf,Allah: A Christian Response;Mark Durie,Revelation? Do We Worship the Same God?) argue that the invocation of the divine name in acts of violence is a critical area for interfaith reflection. Volf notes that “the name of God must never be invoked to justify what is contrary to God’s own nature as revealed in love and holiness” (Volf, 2011).Historical ExamplesThroughout history, the misuse of God’s name has been associated with religious violence—not only in Islam but also in Christian and Jewish contexts. However, the biblical commandment stands as an eternal critique of such abuses.Rabbi Jonathan Sacksremarks that “to invoke the name of God for violence is to violate the Third Commandment and to commit the ultimate blasphemy” (Sacks,Not in God’s Name, 2015).ConclusionThe expanded evidence from scriptural, theological, and historical perspectives confirms thatMuhammad’s encouragement of indiscriminate invocation of “Allahu Akbar”—especially in contexts of violence or triviality—constitutes a clear violation of the third commandment. This practice desacralizes the divine name, making it a tool for human agendas rather than a means of true worship and reverence.The God of the Bible demands that His name be kept holy, invoked only in prayer, praise, and truth, and never profaned for vain or evil purposes. Therefore, the use of “Allahu Akbar” as a slogan for violence or political gain stands condemned by the standard set forth in the Ten Commandments.Shalom,Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Servant of Jesus Christ, Our Great God (Titus 2:13)References and Scholarly SourcesPrimary Texts:The Holy Bible, Exodus 20:7; Leviticus 19:12; Matthew 6:9; Ezekiel 36:21; Jeremiah 23:25-27; Matthew 7:21-23The Qur’an: 2:224, 4:43, 16:91 (on oaths)Sahih al-Bukhari, Hadith 2955;Sahih Muslim, Hadith 872Riyad as-Salihin, Book 17, Hadith 1320Jewish Commentary:Rashion Exodus 20:7Maimonides,Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot Yesodei HaTorah 6:2Babylonian Talmud, Kiddushin 71aChristian Commentary:Martin Luther,Large Catechism, I. 54-56John Calvin,Institutes, II.8.22Scholarly Works:Walter Brueggemann,The Book of Exodus: Introduction, Commentary, and Reflections(The New Interpreter’s Bible)Timothy George,Is the Father of Jesus the God of Muhammad?(Zondervan, 2002)Miroslav Volf,Allah: A Christian Response(HarperOne, 2011)Mark Durie,Revelation?

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThe Ten Commandments represent the moral and theological foundation of the Judeo-Christian tradition, given by God to the Israelites shortly after their exodus from Egypt (Exodus 20:1-17; Deuteronomy 5:6-21). These commandments summarize the 613 mitzvot of the Old Testament Law and are divided into two categories: duties to God (the first four) and duties to fellow humans (the remaining six). Of paramount importance is theFirst Commandment, which declares:“You shall have no other gods before Me.” (Exodus 20:3, NKJV)This commandment rejects all forms of idolatry and syncretism, affirming the uniqueness and exclusivity of the God of Israel—YHWHorJehovah—as the only true God.In examining Muhammad’s teachings and claims as found in the Quran, one encounters profound theological divergences that directly contradict the biblical commandments. This paper will focus on Muhammad’s breaking of the First Commandment, thereby challenging his prophetic authenticity from a biblical perspective.The First Commandment and the Identity of GodThe God of the Bible repeatedly reveals Himself by name:“I am the LORD (YHWH); that is My name!”(Isaiah 42:8)“They will know that My name is Jehovah.”(Jeremiah 16:21)The personal name of God,YHWH, is central to biblical revelation and distinguishes Him from all false deities. Nowhere in the Torah, Psalms, or Gospel does God identify Himself as “Allah.” The assertion that the God of Israel, the Father of Jesus Christ, is the same as Allah in the Quran is theologically and historically unsupported by primary scriptural evidence.Muhammad’s Violation of the First CommandmentQuranic Syncretism and the Denial of JehovahInSurah Al-Ankabut 29:46, the Quran states:“And do not argue with the People of the Scripture except in a way that is best... and say, ‘We believe in that which has been revealed to us and revealed to you. Our God and your God is One; and to Him we are Muslims.’”Here, Muhammad proclaims that Allah is the same as the God worshipped by Jews and Christians. However, this equivalence is unsubstantiated:The Quran never refers to God asYHWHorJehovah.The biblical texts (Torah, Psalms, Gospel) never declare “Allah” as God’s name.Jesus consistently refers to “the Father” and uses the divine name “I AM” (John 8:58), never “Allah.”This Quranic claim constitutes asyncretismthat blends distinct theological identities, directly contradicting the exclusivity demanded by the First Commandment.Theological Inconsistency and the Nature of AllahThe Quran describes paradise in terms that contradict both Old and New Testament morality. For example,Surah Muhammad 47:15describes rivers of wine in paradise:“A description of the Paradise promised to the righteous: in it are rivers of unaltered water, rivers of milk, rivers of wine delicious to those who drink...”Yet,Surah Al-Ma’idah 5:90says:“O you who have believed, indeed, intoxicants, gambling... are but defilement from the work of Satan, so avoid it that you may be successful.”If wine is the “work of Satan” in one verse, why does Allah reward believers with rivers of wine in another? Such internal contradiction undermines the consistency and moral holiness attributed to the God of the Bible (cf. Isaiah 5:11, Galatians 5:19-21). The God of Scripture condemns drunkenness and promises no such sensual rewards in the afterlife.The Problem of the Divine NameIs “Allah” the Biblical God?Scholarly and intertextual evidence demonstrates thatYHWHis never rendered as “Allah” in the Hebrew or Greek scriptures. The name “Allah” is linguistically linked to the pre-Islamic Arabian pantheon, where it designated a high god among many, rather than the exclusive, covenantal God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.Nowhere in the Torah (Pentateuch) does God say, “My name is Allah.”Nowhere in the Psalms or Prophets is God addressed as “Allah.”Nowhere in the Gospels does Jesus call God “Allah.” Instead, He uses “Father” (Greek:Pater; Aramaic:Abba).This distinction is not semantic but theological—indicating a fundamentally different understanding of God’s identity, character, and revelation.Critical Analysis and Theological ImplicationsGiven these facts, the following questions arise for Muslim apologists:Where in the Torah, Psalms, or Gospel does God declare His name as “Allah”?Why does the Quran reject the name Jehovah/YHWH, if it claims to be a continuation of the Abrahamic faith?How can Allah permit what he elsewhere forbids (wine), whereas the biblical God is consistently holy and morally unchanging (Malachi 3:6)?If Muhammad taught a different God and broke the First Commandment by denying the exclusive revelation of YHWH, how can he be considered a true prophet by biblical standards?Conclusion: Muhammad as a False ProphetBy breaking the First Commandment—teaching a different deity, promoting syncretism, and contradicting biblical revelation—Muhammad stands in opposition to the commandments of God as given in Scripture. According to the biblical test of a prophet (Deuteronomy 13:1-5), anyone who leads people to worship a god other than YHWH is to be rejected, regardless of signs or wonders.As such,Muhammad’s prophetic claims are theologically invalid from a biblical perspective. He neither upholds the First Commandment nor affirms the exclusive identity of the God of Israel. Christians and Jews, therefore, are compelled by their scriptures to regard him as a false prophet.“You shall have no other gods before Me.” (Exodus 20:3)Shalom,Dr. Maxwell ShimbaServant of Jesus Christ, our Great God (Titus 2:13),Shimba Theological InstituteReferences:The Holy Bible, New King James Version (NKJV)The Quran (Sahih International Translation)Ismail, A.,The Concept of God in Islam and Christianity(2015)Peters, F.E.,The Children of Abraham: Judaism, Christianity, Islam(1982)Anderson, N.,Islam in Comparative Religion(1965)Exodus 20:1-17, Deuteronomy 5:6-21, Isaiah 42:8, Jeremiah 16:21, John 8:58, Malachi 3:6",

    "full_content": "An Academic and Theological CritiqueBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionTheNinth Commandmentis a cornerstone of Judeo-Christian ethics, demanding truthfulness and forbidding false testimony:“You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.” (Exodus 20:16, ESV)This commandment upholds the value of truth and the sanctity of reputation. In this scholarly debate, we critically examine whether the Prophet Muhammad, founder of Islam, upheld or violated this commandment in his teachings, actions, and legacy.Framing the DebateChristian Theological Position:Truth is not merely a social virtue but a divine attribute. Jesus Christ identified Himself as “the way, the truth, and the life” (John 14:6). Lying, false witness, and deception are repeatedly condemned throughout Scripture (Proverbs 12:22; Revelation 21:8).Islamic Position:The Qur’an encourages honesty (Qur’an 2:42: “And do not mix the truth with falsehood or conceal the truth while you know [it]”). However, Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) and certain hadiths introduce nuanced discussions about truth-telling and permissibility of deceit in specific circumstances.Scholarly Critique: Did Muhammad Bear False Witness?1.Use of Deception in Hadith and SiraSeveral authentic hadiths and early Islamic sources record instances where Muhammad allegedly sanctioned or utilized deception:Taqiyya and Kitman: Although more common in Shia jurisprudence, the concepts of concealing faith or intent for self-preservation or strategic advantage are referenced in Islamic tradition. Sunni sources also recognize exceptions to absolute truth-telling.Hadith Example: War and Deception“The Prophet said, ‘War is deceit.’”(Sahih Bukhari52:269;Sahih Muslim1739)Assassination of Ka’b ibn al-Ashraf:According toSahih Bukhari(Vol. 5, Book 59, Hadith 369) and Ibn Ishaq’sSirat Rasul Allah, Muhammad approved a plot in which one of his followers deceived Ka’b ibn al-Ashraf, leading to his assassination.Muhammad said: “Who will rid me of the son of Ashraf?” Muhammad bin Maslama said, “I will deal with him for you, O Messenger of Allah.” … He was given permission to lie for the sake of the mission.2.Theological Perspective: Is Deception Ever Justified?The Bible’s Standard:The Bible offers almost no exceptions for bearing false witness, even in difficult circumstances. Truth is integral to God’s nature (Numbers 23:19).Muhammad’s Example:The permission to lie in certain contexts (war, reconciliation between people, to one’s spouse) is found inSahih Muslim(Book 32, Hadith 6303):“It is not a lie to be used in war, to bring reconciliation between people, or to a wife to please her.”3.Accusations Against OthersJews and Christians:Muhammad repeatedly accused Jews and Christians of corrupting their scriptures and hiding the truth about his prophethood (Qur’an 2:75-79; 3:71), though these accusations lack corroborating historical evidence outside the Islamic narrative.Charges of Polytheism and Deception:Islamic sources allege that Jews and Christians are “people of the book” who “conceal” or “distort” the Word of God (Qur’an 4:46; 5:13-15). From a critical perspective, this could be seen as bearing false witness against whole religious communities without substantiated proof.Islamic ResponseDefenders of Muhammadargue that:Context is critical:“Deception”cited in war is akin to military strategy, not the sort of malicious lying prohibited by the Ninth Commandment.The Prophet’s general teachings emphasize truthfulness and justice (Qur’an 33:70; 4:135).The permission to lie in exceptional circumstances (war, reconciliation, family harmony) is not the same as “bearing false witness” in the legal or malicious sense.Scholarly RebuttalScriptural Consistency:The Biblical commandment makes no exception for “strategic” or “expedient” lying.Ethical Absolutism:Jesus intensifies the call to truthfulness (Matthew 5:37), and the Apostles warn against any form of lying (Colossians 3:9; 1 John 2:21).Historical Impact:Muhammad’s legacy of sanctioning deception in certain contexts has been cited by critics as a precedent for double standards within Islamic jurisprudence.ConclusionDid Muhammad break the Ninth Commandment?From a strictJudeo-Christian perspective, the answer appears to be yes: the prophetic record in hadith and sira literature shows instances where deception and false accusation were permitted or practiced.However,Islamic theologyinterprets these acts contextually, maintaining Muhammad’s integrity within its own ethical framework.Final Question for Debate:Can a prophet of God ever be justified in bearing false witness, or does true prophethood require absolute adherence to the divine standard of truth—without exception?ReferencesThe Holy Bible, Exodus 20:16; John 14:6; Proverbs 12:22; Matthew 5:37.The Qur’an: 2:42, 2:75-79, 3:71, 4:46, 4:135, 5:13-15, 33:70.Sahih Bukhari 52:269; 59:369.Sahih Muslim 1739; 6303.Ibn Ishaq,Sirat Rasul Allah.Prepared by Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological Institute.

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThe Ten Commandments, as recorded in the book of Exodus, form the ethical bedrock of Judeo-Christian civilization. Among them, the Fifth Commandment stands as a cornerstone of social stability and divine expectation:\"Honor your father and your mother, so that your days may be long in the land the LORD your God is giving you.\"(Exodus 20:12, ESV)This commandment is repeatedly emphasized throughout Scripture (Deuteronomy 5:16; Ephesians 6:2), highlighting the importance of honoring one’s parents with respect, kindness, and dignity. In contrast, the life and teachings of Muhammad, the founder of Islam, present a significant departure from this divine mandate.Muhammad’s Disregard for Parental HonorIt is a well-established fact in Islamic tradition that Muhammad was orphaned at a young age, having lost both his mother, Amina, and his father, Abdullah. However, rather than honoring their memory, the hadith literature shockingly records Muhammad condemning both parents as unbelievers (kuffar), thus consigning them to hellfire.Hadith Evidence: Muhammad Declares His Mother a DisbelieverSahih Muslim, one of the most authentic collections of hadith, records the following narration:Abu Huraira reported:The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said,\"I asked my Lord's permission to pray for forgiveness for my mother, but He did not permit me. I asked His permission to visit her grave, and He permitted me.\"(Sahih Muslim, Book 004, Hadith 2130)Classical Islamic exegesis, such as in ‘Awn al-Ma’bud, confirms the reason for this divine prohibition:“His saying, ‘He did not permit me,’ means that she was a disbeliever and it is not allowed to ask forgiveness for a disbeliever.”Thus, by Islamic sources, Muhammad’s own mother died as a “kafir”—an unbeliever—for whom even the Prophet was not permitted to pray.The Fate of Muhammad’s FatherSimilarly, Sahih Muslim also narrates:Anas reported:A man said, “O Messenger of Allah, where is my father?” He replied,“In the Fire.”When he turned away, he called him back and said,“My father and your father are in the Fire.”(Sahih Muslim, Book 001, Hadith 0398)Here, Muhammad unequivocally declares that his father, Abdullah, is in hellfire.The Theological ImplicationsFrom a Judeo-Christian perspective, this attitude is a grave violation of the Fifth Commandment. While the Bible commands believers to honor their parents regardless of their faith, Muhammad’s testimony amounts to a posthumous curse, denying them even basic dignity or remembrance in prayer. Nowhere in the New Testament do we find Jesus ever dishonoring His mother Mary, despite the hardships He faced. In fact, Jesus on the cross ensured Mary’s care (John 19:26-27).Critical Questions and Pagan AssociationsWhy does Muhammad explicitly state that both his parents are in hellfire?Why is his father named ‘Abdullah’ (servant of Allah) if he was a pagan?Does this not suggest that ‘Allah’ was worshipped in pre-Islamic pagan Arabia, even before Muhammad’s prophethood?The etymology and usage of the name ‘Abdullah’ point toward the pre-Islamic veneration of Allah as a pagan deity, sometimes identified with the moon god ‘al-ilah’ or ‘Hubal,’ widely worshipped throughout the Middle East. This pre-Islamic use of “Allah” is akin to Hebrew names honoring Yahweh (Joshua, Hezekiah, etc.), but the context for Allah is demonstrably pagan.Historical sources indicate that Abdul Muttalib, Muhammad’s grandfather, nearly sacrificed Abdullah to Allah, only to substitute him with a hundred camels—another clear example of pagan ritual practices (seeSirat Rasul Allahby Ibn Ishaq).A Tragic Contrast: Jesus and Mary vs. Muhammad and His ParentsIn the New Testament, the mother of Jesus, Mary, is presented as blessed and honored (Luke 1:48). No canonical Gospel or Christian teaching ever depicts Mary as dying in sin or being condemned by her son. By contrast, the Islamic texts assert that Muhammad’s own parents died as disbelievers—an indictment that not only tarnishes the memory of his family but directly violates the Fifth Commandment.ConclusionMuhammad’s explicit statements about his parents, recorded in authentic hadith literature, show a clear disregard for the biblical command to honor father and mother. Instead of upholding the dignity of his parents, he condemned them as kuffar, even declaring their punishment in the afterlife. This theological position not only separates Muhammad from the prophetic tradition of the Bible but exposes a fundamental divergence in the understanding of divine law and familial piety.As Christian theologians, it is critical to assess these issues with both scholarly rigor and fidelity to biblical ethics. The evidence presented here demonstrates that Muhammad, by his own testimony and by Islamic sources, broke the Fifth Commandment, and thus cannot be upheld as a moral exemplar according to biblical standards.References:The Holy Bible, Exodus 20:12; Ephesians 6:2Sahih Muslim, Book 004, Hadith 2130; Book 001, Hadith 0398‘Awn al-Ma’bud, Commentary on HadithIbn Ishaq,Sirat Rasul AllahJohn 19:26-27; Luke 1:48Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute“Looking for the blessed hope and glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ.” (Titus 2:13)",

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteMuhammad and the Violation of the Seventh Commandment: A Theological and Scholarly Critique“You shall not commit adultery.” — Exodus 20:14Introduction: The Seventh Commandment in Judeo-Christian EthicsThe Seventh Commandment, “You shall not commit adultery,” is a cornerstone of biblical morality, signifying the sanctity of marriage and sexual purity as divinely instituted values. Within both the Old and New Testaments, the prohibition against adultery is explicit and repeatedly affirmed (cf. Leviticus 18:20; Matthew 5:27-28). Its violation was considered a grave sin, incurring severe consequences under Mosaic Law.Quranic Law on AdulteryThe Qur’an equally condemns adultery. InSurah An-Nur (24:2), it is stated:“The woman and the man guilty of fornication, flog each of them with a hundred stripes. Let not compassion move you in their case, in a matter prescribed by Allah, if you believe in Allah and the Last Day. And let a party of the believers witness their punishment.”This passage demonstrates a strict legalistic approach to punishing adulterers, prescribing public flogging and calling for no mercy.The Prophet Muhammad’s Contradictions: Historical and Hadith AccountsDespite the Quran’s severe position on adultery, an analysis of Islamic sources and classical commentaries reveals multiple narratives in which the Prophet Muhammad himself appears to have transgressed this very commandment.1. The Incident with Mariyah al-QibtiyyaAccording toTafsir Ibn Kathir (Vol. 6, p. 367)and various hadith collections, there is an account involving Muhammad, his wife Hafsa bint Umar, and his Coptic concubine, Mariyah al-Qibtiyya. One day, while Hafsa was away, Muhammad engaged in an intimate encounter with Mariyah in Hafsa’s room. Upon returning and discovering the event, Hafsa confronted Muhammad, who responded by swearing never to touch Mariyah again—a vow later annulled (Qur’an 66:1-2).Despite this being an explicit case of sexual relations outside the context of marriage, neither Muhammad nor Mariyah were subjected to the Quranic punishment of flogging. This raises a significant theological question:Was Muhammad above the very law he claimed to deliver?2. Sexual Exploitation of Female SlavesSunan Abu Dawud, Book 38, No. 4458reports an instance where Muhammad’s female slave was shared sexually with another man, upon which Muhammad instructed Ali ibn Abi Talib to punish her only after her menstrual bleeding stopped, as she was found to be bleeding at the time.The use of concubines and female captives as sexual objects is explicitly allowed in the Qur’an (Qur’an 4:24), stating:“...And [forbidden to you are] married women except those your right hands possess...”This clause is used to legitimize sexual relations with captive women, outside the covenant of marriage, an idea that is entirely foreign to biblical ethics and the prophetic tradition of the Old and New Testaments (cf. Genesis 2:24; Hebrews 13:4).3. Homoeroticism and Gender Norms in HadithCertain hadiths, includingMusnad Ahmad 16245andSahih Bukhari 1:4:152, allege that Muhammad engaged in intimate acts with young boys, such as sucking their tongues or kissing their mouths, and even displaying his nakedness to them. Such reports, if authentic, point to gross violations of sexual ethics, as recognized in both biblical and natural law.4. Questionable Marital EthicsFurther, Muhammad is reported to have stated that a wife must submit to her husband's sexual demands at any time, regardless of circumstances (seeMkweli Mwaminifu, J. 1-2, Hadith No. 462, p. 204), thereby reducing women to mere sexual objects and undermining the mutual respect foundational to biblical marriage.The Qur’an and the Legitimization of Sexual DevianceThe Qur’an, in some passages, describes paradise as a place of sensual reward involving young boys and beautiful women (Qur’an 52:24; 56:17; 76:19), a depiction that stands in stark contrast to the biblical vision of heaven as a place of holiness and communion with God (cf. Matthew 22:30; Revelation 21:27).Theological and Ethical CritiqueFrom a biblical and theological perspective, Muhammad’s actions—as reported in authoritative Islamic sources—constitute a clear violation of the Seventh Commandment. The New Testament goes even further, equating lustful intent with adultery (Matthew 5:28), and upholding sexual purity as a fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23).The moral inconsistency is therefore profound:The same figure who instituted harsh penalties for adultery is himself portrayed as transgressing those boundaries without repercussion.The Quran and hadith allow for sexual relations with concubines, captives, and even hint at acceptance of same-sex acts, all of which are condemned in the Bible (Leviticus 18:22; Romans 1:26-27; Hebrews 13:4).The Prophet of Islam seems to operate above the law, violating the ethical standards he imposed on others.Biblical Response to False ProphetsJesus warned his followers:“Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves.” (Matthew 7:15)A true prophet must exemplify the law and character of God. The behaviors attributed to Muhammad in the hadith literature disqualify him by biblical standards. As Christians, we affirm that only Christ is the fulfillment of the law and the model of perfect holiness (Hebrews 4:15; 1 Peter 2:22).ConclusionA thorough, scholarly examination of Muhammad’s life—measured by the standard of the Seventh Commandment—reveals clear transgressions according to both the letter and the spirit of God’s law. Far from being above the law, a true prophet is called to embody it. The evidence from Islamic sources themselves is a powerful indictment, inviting Muslims and non-Muslims alike to reconsider the moral claims of Muhammad’s prophethood in light of biblical revelation.Shalom,Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteTitus 2:13References:The Holy Bible, NIV, Exodus 20:14; Matthew 5:27-28; Hebrews 13:4The Qur’an, 4:24; 24:2; 52:24; 56:17; 66:1-2; 76:19Tafsir Ibn Kathir, Vol. 6Sunan Abu Dawud, Book 38Musnad Ahmad 16245Sahih Bukhari 1:4:152Mkweli Mwaminifu, J. 1-2“Life of the Prophet” by Sheikh A.S.

    "full_content": "A Theological Challenge to Islamic Claims of ProphethoodBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionOne of the most striking theological contrasts between the biblical prophets and Muhammad—the founder of Islam—lies in the mode of their calling and revelation. Throughout the Hebrew Scriptures and the Christian Bible, a consistent pattern emerges: the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob calls, appoints, and converses directly with His chosen prophets. From Abraham to Moses, from Isaiah to Jeremiah, divine encounters and direct communication underscore the authenticity of their prophetic office.By contrast, Muhammad—the central figure of Islam—never claimed a single direct conversation with Allah. Instead, all of his revelations, according to Islamic sources, were mediated by the angel Jibreel (Gabriel). This peculiar pattern raises profound theological questions:Why would Allah, who claims absolute power and self-sufficiency, need an intermediary to communicate with his purported final prophet? Why is there not a single verse in the Qur’an in which Allah directly appoints or converses with Muhammad, as with the prophets of the Bible?The Quranic Admission: Allah Spoke to Moses DirectlyThe Qur’an itself admits a special status for Moses:Surah 4:164– \"Messengers we have told you about, and messengers we never told you about. And God spoke to Moses directly.\" (Rashad Khalifa translation)This verse acknowledges a unique privilege accorded to Moses, one not shared with Muhammad. If Muhammad is regarded as the ‘seal of the prophets’ and the greatest messenger, as Muslims assert, why is he denied this direct audience with Allah?The Biblical Pattern: Direct Divine AppointmentA survey of the Old Testament demonstrates that each prophet is called by God directly. Consider these examples:Abraham: \"The LORD said to Abram, 'Leave your country, your people and your father’s household...'\" (Genesis 12:1)Moses: \"God called to him from within the bush, 'Moses! Moses!'\" (Exodus 3:4)Samuel: \"The LORD called Samuel...\" (1 Samuel 3:4)Isaiah: \"Then I heard the voice of the LORD saying, 'Whom shall I send?'\" (Isaiah 6:8)Jeremiah: \"The word of the LORD came to me, saying, 'Before I formed you in the womb I knew you... I appointed you as a prophet to the nations.'\" (Jeremiah 1:4-5)In every instance, it is God Himself who initiates, commissions, and converses with the prophet. No intermediary is necessary.The Islamic Dilemma: An Absent VoiceIn stark contrast, Muhammad’s revelations were, without exception, relayed by Jibreel. The Qur’an is silent on any direct speech from Allah to Muhammad. Not only is there no record of Allah speaking directly to Muhammad, but there is also no account in the Qur’an where Allah commands Jibreel explicitly to relay a message; the claims of angelic mediation rest on tradition rather than explicit Quranic instruction.Theological Problems with MediationThis raises troubling questions for Islamic theology:If Allah is omnipotent and transcendent, why rely on a messenger to speak to Muhammad?How can Muhammad be considered the “seal” and greatest of prophets if denied what was given to Moses and others?Why would Allah, who claims not to need any partners or helpers (“Say: He is Allah, the One and Only”—Surah 112:1), consistently depend on Jibreel for the most crucial task—delivering His final revelation?Where in the Qur’an does Allah ever instruct Jibreel to deliver the message? Such explicit divine commissioning is entirely absent.The Prophetic Test: Authenticity through Divine EncounterThe office of a prophet is validated by direct encounter with God. The lack of such in Muhammad’s life challenges the very foundation of his prophethood. The prophets of old could declare with authority, “Thus says the LORD.” Muhammad, by contrast, could only claim, “Jibreel said...” This is a radical departure from the established prophetic model.Conclusion: Is Muhammad’s Prophethood Bogus?The Islamic narrative leaves us with an inescapable theological dilemma. If direct divine appointment and communication are hallmarks of true prophecy, then Muhammad’s absence of such experience, by the Quran’s own admission, renders his claim to prophethoodquestionable at best and bogus at worst. Moses and other biblical prophets were authenticated by direct encounters with God. Muhammad stands alone, never hearing the voice of Allah, never receiving a direct commission.To Muslim readers:How can you place your eternal trust in a prophet who never spoke to the God who supposedly sent him? How can Muhammad be the greatest of prophets if denied the most basic prophetic privilege?A call to reconsider:It is time to re-examine the claims of Muhammad’s prophethood with intellectual honesty and theological rigor. The evidence is clear: in the matter of divine communication, Muhammad does not meet the standard set by the biblical prophets.By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological Institute",

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteIntroductionIn interfaith dialogues and theological debates, one of the most crucial tasks is to examine claims to divine revelation with careful scrutiny. The Quran makes bold assertions regarding its relationship to previous scriptures, particularly the Bible (the Taurat and Injil). However, a critical evaluation reveals deep contradictions at the heart of Islam's claims, thus exposing the falsity of its doctrine. This post offers a theological analysis showing why Islam cannot stand as the true revelation of God.1.The Quran Affirms the Bible as Divine RevelationThe Quran repeatedly acknowledges the authority and truth of the previous scriptures given by God to the Jews and Christians:“…Those unto whom We gave the Scripture [the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] know that it is revealed from your Lord in truth…”(Quran Surah 6:114)Here, the Quran affirms that the previous revelations – the Torah and the Gospel – were genuine and divinely revealed, existing as true guidance before the coming of Muhammad. This admission is found not only in Surah 6:114 but also in Surah 3:3, Surah 5:46-48, and Surah 10:94, where Muhammad himself is told to consult “those who have been reading the Book before you” if he has any doubts.2.The Quran Claims That God’s Words Cannot Be ChangedIslamic doctrine holds that the words of Allah are unalterable:“And the Word of your Lord has been fulfilled in truth and in justice. None can change His Words. And He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower.”(Quran Surah 6:115)“There is none that can alter the words (and decrees) of Allah.”(Quran Surah 6:34)This is a foundational principle. If Allah’s words are unchangeable, then the previous scriptures – the Torah and the Gospel – remain intact and trustworthy as revelations from God.3.Islam Contradicts the Bible on Essential DoctrinesDespite the Quran’s affirmation of the Bible, it fundamentally contradicts the core message of the Gospel – the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus Christ:Quran:Denies the crucifixion of Jesus.“They killed him not, nor crucified him, but it was made to appear to them…”(Quran Surah 4:157)Bible:Affirms the crucifixion as the central act of redemption.“Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures…”(1 Corinthians 15:3-4)“They crucified Him…”(Mark 15:25)This is not a minor disagreement but a direct contradiction on the most pivotal event in the Christian faith.4.The Dilemma and the Inescapable ConclusionIf the Quran is true, then the Bible must also be true and uncorrupted, since the Quran repeatedly testifies to the authenticity and preservation of the earlier scriptures.If the Bible is true,then Islam is false because the Bible’s core message – especially the crucifixion, death, and resurrection of Jesus – is absolutely contradicted by the Quran.Yet, if Muslims argue that the Bible is corrupted, they must then admit the Quran’s error in affirming the Bible’s reliability and preservation. This undermines the Quran’s own claim of being a confirmation and guardian of previous revelations (Quran 5:48).5.Islam Is Self-RefutingThus, the logic is simple and devastating:The Quran affirms the Bible.The Quran claims God’s Word cannot be changed.The Quran contradicts the Bible on essential doctrine.Therefore, if the Quran is true, the Bible is true. But the Bible contradicts the Quran.Therefore, Islam is self-refuting.Conclusion:The internal inconsistency of Islam regarding the status of the Bible and its own contradictory teachings demonstrate that Islam cannot be a true revelation from the One True God. Christianity stands as the only faith grounded in the consistent and historical revelation of God’s Word.For more in-depth theological resources and interfaith apologetics, visit Shimba Theological Institute.By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteLet me know if you need references, graphics, or further scholarly expansion!Scholarly Expansion: The Self-Refuting Nature of Islam1.The Quran’s Witness to Previous Scriptures: A Closer ExaminationThe Quran’s testimony to the previous scriptures is not a marginal claim, but a repeated assertion that forms a core pillar of its self-identity:Surah 2:41:“And believe in what I have sent down, confirming that which is with you (the People of the Book)…”Surah 3:3:“He has sent down upon you, [O Muhammad], the Book in truth, confirming what was before it. And He revealed the Torah and the Gospel.”Surah 10:94:“So if you are in doubt, [O Muhammad], about that which We have revealed to you, then ask those who have been reading the Scripture before you…”Classical Islamic exegesis(tafsir), such as that ofIbn KathirandAl-Tabari, acknowledge these verses refer to the actual texts in the hands of Jews and Christians in the Prophet’s time—not hypothetical, lost, or secret texts. Therefore, the Quran appeals to the integrity and public presence of the Bible as then extant.2.The Doctrine of Inalterability: Scriptural and Theological WeightThe unchangeability of God’s word is affirmed emphatically:Surah 18:27:“And recite what has been revealed to you of the Book of your Lord. None can change His words…”This is not just a claim about abstract decrees, but specifically about previous “Books” (kutub), which the Quran repeatedly claims to confirm.Islamic Scholarship Admits the Challenge:Tafsir al-Jalalayn:“None can alter His words,” meaning both His promises and His revealed Books.Al-Razi:“There can be no replacement or corruption (tahrif) of God’s word.”Yet, thedoctrine of tahrif(corruption of previous scriptures) arose only centuries later among Muslim polemicists as a response to Christian and Jewish critique—contradicting the Quran’s plain statements.3.Historical and Textual Criticism: The Integrity of the BibleArchaeological and manuscript evidencedemonstrates that the Torah and the Gospels in circulation during Muhammad’s time are textually consistent with those available today:Dead Sea Scrolls (2nd century BC – 1st century AD):Demonstrate the stability of the Hebrew Bible text centuries before Christ and Muhammad.Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus (4th century AD):Show the content of the New Testament is fundamentally unchanged from the era before Islam.No credible historical evidence supports the claim that Christians or Jews corrupted the text after the Quran’s revelation.4.Central Doctrinal ContradictionsThe Crucifixion:Quran (4:157):“They did not kill him, nor did they crucify him, but it was made to appear to them.”Bible:“For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that He was buried, and that He was raised…”(1 Corinthians 15:3-4)Thehistorical consensusamong secular and religious historians—Jewish, Christian, and even most secular Islamic historians—is that Jesus was, in fact, crucified. Muslim denials have no historical support and were unknown among the earliest Christian heresies.5.Theological Implications: What Is at Stake?A. God’s Integrity and ConsistencyIf Allah truly revealed the Torah and Gospel, and if His words cannot be changed, then for the Quran to contradict those revelations is to make Allah inconsistent—or for the Quran to be in error.B. The Doctrine of Abrogation (Naskh)Some Muslims claim that later revelations abrogate (cancel) earlier ones. However, this cannot apply to previous scriptures external to the Quran itself—especially when the Quran claims toconfirmthose earlier revelations, not cancel them (see Surah 5:48).C. The Failure of Tahrif ArgumentsMuslim apologists often claim the Bible was “textually corrupted” (tahrif al-nass) or only “misinterpreted” (tahrif al-ma’na). But the Quran never clearly claims this, and the burden of proof for such claims is on the accuser—one that is not met by historical evidence.6.Scholarly Conclusions from Comparative TheologyChristianitystands on the unbroken testimony of both Old and New Testaments, corroborated by archaeology, manuscript evidence, and fulfilled prophecy.Islamself-refutes by both affirming and denying the core message of the Bible. It stands alone in world religions in claiming to “confirm” the Bible, yet systematically denying its most central truths.Therefore:If the Quran is correct about the Bible’s integrity, Islam is false due to contradiction.If the Quran is wrong about the Bible’s integrity, Islam is false due to a historical error and a failed claim to divine knowledge.7.Final Challenge and InvitationNo serious scholar—Christian, Jewish, or secular—accepts the doctrine of a wholesale textual corruption of the Bible after the 7th century.We invite all seekers of truth to examine the Scriptures and history honestly. The Christian Gospel alone stands vindicated by prophecy, history, manuscript evidence, and spiritual coherence.Islam, by its own testimony, falls.For further reading:Samuel Green, “The Gospel According to Islam”Gordon D.

In the Islamic tradition, Muhammad is upheld as the \"Seal of the Prophets\" (Qur’an 33:40), and his revelation is considered final and infallible by the majority of Muslims. Yet, critical scholarship and Islamic historical sources themselves reveal troubling episodes that cast doubt upon this claim—most notably, the so-called \"Satanic Verses\" incident. This article examines the theological, historical, and logical implications of Muhammad’s confessed encounters with Satanic influence, using Islamic sources and academic analysis to challenge the foundation of his prophethood.1. The \"Satanic Verses\" and Muhammad’s ConfessionThe \"Satanic Verses\" episode is attested in multiple early Islamic sources, includingal-Tabari’sTarikh(History), Volume 6:111, as referenced in the image above. According to these accounts, Muhammad allegedly recited verses acknowledging pagan deities (al-Lat, al-Uzza, and Manat) as \"exalted cranes whose intercession is to be hoped for\" (see al-Tabari 6:107-111; Ibn Ishaq,Sirat Rasul Allah, p. 165). Later, Muhammad claimed that these verses were not from God but were \"whispered\" to him by Satan.“I have fabricated things against God and have imputed to Him words which He has not spoken.”— Muhammad,al-Tabari 6:111This confession raises immediate concerns:If Muhammad, the supposed messenger of Allah, could be deceived by Satan, how many other revelations may have been similarly compromised?Furthermore, how can followers be confident in the authenticity of any revelation Muhammad delivered?2. Theological Problems: Can God’s Prophet Be Deceived?The Qur’an itself asserts that God's messengers are protected from Satanic influence:“And We did not send before you any messenger or prophet except that when he spoke [or recited], Satan threw into it [some misunderstanding]. But Allah abolishes that which Satan throws in; then Allah makes precise His verses. And Allah is Knowing and Wise.”(Qur’an 22:52)Ironically, this verse admits the possibility that Satan can, at least temporarily, influence even God's chosen messengers. This stands in stark contrast to the Biblical standard for prophets, wherefalse prophecy is a sign of disqualification(Deuteronomy 18:20-22).a. Did Muhammad Receive Other Verses from Satan?If the most significant Qur’anic surahs were vulnerable to corruption by Satanic suggestion, how can the Islamic community trust that other verses have not been similarly compromised? The lack of a mechanism for verifying the divine origin of each revelation, beyond Muhammad's own assertion, makes the entire corpus of the Qur’an open to suspicion.b. Why Did Allah Not Prevent This?If Allah is truly all-powerful and all-knowing, why did he allow his final prophet to be so easily deceived by Satan? Should divine omnipotence not guarantee the protection of revelation? The fact that Allah only \"abolishes\" the satanic versesaftertheir recitation does not inspire confidence in the infallibility of the process.3. The Confusion Between Gabriel and Satan: A Tragic DilemmaOne of the greatest ironies is Muhammad’s failure to distinguish between Jibreel (Gabriel), the messenger of God, and Satan, the enemy of God. If both can appear and communicate in similar ways, how can the prophet—and by extension, his followers—have any assurance of the source of revelation? This confusion undermines the credibility of all subsequent Islamic teachings.Did Jibreel and Satan look alike to Muhammad?Why did Muhammad not test the spirits as instructed in Biblical tradition?(1 John 4:1)The episode reveals atheological crisis: If even the prophet cannot reliably distinguish between divine and demonic communication, no Muslim can be certain of the Qur’an’s authenticity.4. Scholarly and Historical ReferencesAl-Tabari,The History of al-Tabari, Vol. 6(trans. W. Montgomery Watt and M.V. McDonald, SUNY Press, 1987)Ibn Ishaq,Sirat Rasul Allah(The Life of Muhammad, trans. A. Guillaume, Oxford University Press, 1955)Ibn Sa’d,Kitab al-Tabaqat al-KabirQur’an 22:52(admission of Satanic interference)Deuteronomy 18:20-22(Biblical test of prophecy)Sahih Bukhari, Volume 1, Book 1, Hadith 3(Muhammad's encounters with spirits)Numerous classical Muslim historians did not shy away from these troubling reports, though later apologetics tried to suppress or reinterpret them. Orientalist scholars such as William Muir, Alfred Guillaume, and others have discussed the devastating theological implications for Islam.5. Conclusion: A Tragedy for Islamic TheologyThe admission—found within Islam’s own canonical sources—that Muhammad could (and did) speak under the influence of Satan, fabricating words in the name of God, is afatal blow to the credibility of his prophethood. If Satan could infiltrate divine revelation once, how can the entire Qur’an or hadith corpus be trusted? Why did Allah, purportedly all-powerful, not intervene until after the event?This crisis remains unresolved. The integrity of Islamic revelation is thusirreparably underminedby its own historical tradition—a great tragedy for those seeking certainty in the words attributed to God.ReferencesAl-Tabari,The History of al-Tabari, Vol. 6, pp. 107-111Ibn Ishaq,Sirat Rasul Allah, pp. 165The Qur’an 22:52Deuteronomy 18:20-22Guillaume, A.,The Life of MuhammadMuir, W.,The Life of MahometSahih Bukhari, Vol. 1, Book 1, Hadith 3By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological Institute*For further reading, students and scholars are encouraged to review the classical Islamic commentaries (Tafsir), original historical sources, and comparative theological studies.",

This reality has profound theological implications and calls for serious reflection by anyone who seeks the truth about spiritual freedom in Christ versus bondage in other systems.80,000 Demons in the Body of MuhammadAs recorded by Daniel Mwankemwa, and echoed by former Islamic scholars, it is said:\"Muhammad was possessed by 80,000 demons who dominated, guided, and commanded him throughout his life.\"The text continues:\"Scholars maintain that when Muhammad began preaching Islam, God sent Gabriel to warn him because he was engaged in evil works. Gabriel urged Muhammad, 'Go to the Christians to learn and be saved.' But the demons within Muhammad refused to let him go and prevented him from receiving salvation through Christ.These demons were so numerous and pervasive that they blocked every avenue through which God's message could reach Muhammad: 40,000 demons settled in his spirit to block the word of God, 30,000 in his mind to blind his reasoning, and 10,000 in his eyes to obscure the truth. Thus, Muhammad was rendered spiritually deaf, blind, and resistant to the Gospel.\"(From the book\"Save Us from the Evil One, The World of Jinn\"by Joshua Kanani Chabu, a graduate of Al-Azhar University, Cairo, UK.28)The Influence of Jinn on Muslim WomenBut the demonic oppression in Islam is not limited to Muhammad alone. The same source reports that Muslim women, particularly when visiting mosques, are often \"entered by jinn.\"On page 34, a jinn named Arafu is described:\"A jinn whose task is to 'please women.' When a Muslim woman is fully committed to her Islamic faith, she may be possessed by a 'male jinn' who provides her with intense pleasure, such that for thirty days she has no desire for her husband. This jinn is one of those that entered her during her conversion to Islam. The tradition even records that when women pray in mosques, they do so without undergarments—an old custom with sinister origins. Aisha, one of Muhammad’s wives, spoke of it. Fathers are even encouraged to honor women who have been possessed by these jinn. Female jinn, on the other hand, are assigned to please Muslim men.\"The Power of Jesus Christ Over DemonsWhat a sharp contrast with the ministry of Jesus Christ! When Christ walked this earth,He gave His followers the authority to cast out demons and set the captives free:“Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy, drive out demons. Freely you have received; freely give.”(Matthew 10:8)The Gospels tell of Christ's encounter with the demoniac of the Gadarenes, a man possessed bya legion of demons(Mark 5:1–13). Jesus asked,\"What is your name?\"and the demons replied,\"Legion, for we are many.\"But with a word, Jesus cast them out and the man was set free!Theological Reflection: Why Did Muhammad Remain in Bondage?I must ask, and I invite you to ponder deeply:Why did Muhammad choose to remain tormented by 80,000 demons until his death, instead of seeking deliverance through the name and power of Jesus Christ?Even today, why do Muslim women reject Christ, knowing that they risk demonic possession, even to the extent of engaging in disturbing rituals within their places of worship?Jesus stands ready to deliver all who call upon Him. The tragedy is not only in Muhammad’s bondage but also in the millions who remain under the influence of these dark powers, refusing the freedom only Christ can offer.Reflect on this:If the spiritual foundation of Islam is so deeply entwined with demonic presence and activity, what does that mean for its message, its prophet, and its followers?Shalom,Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteMax Shimba Ministries Org.",

This article exposes the theological, scientific, and anthropological shortcomings of this hadith, challenging Muslims to reconsider the very foundation of what constitutes divine revelation.Section I: Examining the Hadith—Origins, Transmission, and Canonical StatusTextual Source:The hadith is found inAl-Adab Al-Mufrad253, a respected collection by Imam al-Bukhari, and also appears in other Sunni compilations (e.g., Sunan Ibn Majah 4183). The Arabic reads:لا تُكْثِرُوا الضَّحِكَ فَإِنَّ كَثْرَةَ الضَّحِكِ تُميتُ الْقَلْبَ\"Do not laugh a lot. Much laughter kills the heart.\"Transmission:Reported by Abu Hurayra, one of the most prolific hadith transmitters.Regarded ashasan(good) by many hadith scholars, and widely quoted in Islamic ethics.Canonical Authority:Frequently cited in Islamic sermons (khutbah), Sufi treatises on spiritual discipline, and mainstream Sunni jurisprudence.Used to promotezuhd(asceticism), somberness, and emotional restraint in piety.Section II: Comparative Scriptural Analysis1. The Biblical Testimony: Laughter as HealingThe Bible provides a radically different view, grounded in both Old and New Testament theology:Proverbs 17:22“A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones.”Ecclesiastes 3:4“A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance.”Genesis 21:6“And Sarah said, ‘God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear will laugh with me.’”Luke 6:21 (Jesus speaking):“Blessed are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh.”Analysis:Laughter is depicted as a divine gift, a natural response to God’s blessings, and essential to emotional and spiritual well-being.The “merry heart” is not a spiritual liability, but a source of resilience, healing, and communion with others.Patristic Witness:Early Church Fathers (e.g., John Chrysostom, Augustine) often affirmed the goodness of laughter in moderation, seeing joy as a fruit of the Spirit (cf. Galatians 5:22).2. Interreligious Parallels and ContrastJudaism:Rabbinic literature celebrates humor and joy as essential to study, prayer, and resilience, e.g., “When Adar enters, joy increases” (Taanit 29a).Christianity:Saints and theologians, such as Thomas Aquinas and C.S. Lewis, regard joy and laughter as signs of grace.Buddhism:Laughter is considered a sign of enlightenment in Zen traditions (“the laughing Buddha” motif).Hinduism:Laughter yoga (Hasyayoga) is a respected spiritual practice.Contrast:Only in certain strands of ascetic Islamic, monastic, or ultra-orthodox religious expression do we find strong warnings against mirth—never an absolute prohibition as in this hadith.Section III: Scientific and Medical Evidence—Laughter as Therapy1. Psychological and Physiological ResearchA. Laughter and Cardiovascular HealthAmerican Heart Association(2020): “Laughter reduces artery inflammation and increases HDL (good cholesterol).”Harvard Health Publishing(2019): “Laughter improves blood vessel function and increases blood flow, which can help protect against heart attacks.”B. Neurochemical EffectsLaughter triggers endorphin release, lowering stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline (Berk, L.S. et al., 1989).Boosts dopamine and serotonin, alleviating depression and anxiety (Mora-Ripoll, 2010).C. Immunology and LongevityStudies fromLoma Linda University(Bennett, 2003): Laughter strengthens the immune response, increasing infection-fighting antibodies.Elderly populations with a sense of humor have lower mortality rates (Martin, R.A., 2002).D. Social and Cognitive BenefitsLaughter is a social glue, facilitating trust, empathy, and group cohesion.Used therapeutically for pain management and trauma recovery (Journal of Holistic Nursing, 2011).E. World Health OrganizationWHO officially endorses “laughter therapy” as a tool in mental health programs worldwide.2. Direct Scientific Debunking of the HadithNowhere in reputable medical literatureis there any evidence that “much laughter kills the heart.”If anything, excessive laughter (such as in rare medical conditions likegelastic seizures) is a neurological disorder, not a moral or spiritual failing.The overwhelming evidence is clear:Laughter heals, it does not kill.Section IV: Historical and Sociocultural Analysis—Origins of Somberness in Islam1. The Context of Muhammad’s ArabiaThe Arabian Peninsula during Muhammad’s era was marked by frequent tribal conflict, poverty, and survivalism.Somberness was often equated with seriousness and dignity; frivolity was discouraged among tribal leaders.Many hadiths promote ascetic discipline, frowning upon music, dancing, and even smiling in excess (cf. Sahih Muslim 4925: “Do not laugh too much for much laughter deadens the heart.”).2. Later Islamic SpiritualitySufism:Despite some mystical orders advocating joy and ecstatic expressions, mainstream Islamic law (Sharia) codified this hadith into behavioral norms, especially for scholars, jurists, and mosque leaders.Legal Manuals:Ihya Ulum al-Din(al-Ghazali),Riyadh as-Salihin(an-Nawawi), andAdab al-Dunya wa’d-Din(al-Mawardi) all quote this hadith approvingly.3. Comparison to Christian and Jewish EthicsBy contrast, Christian and Jewish authorities integrated laughter into worship, liturgy, and social customs, recognizing its capacity to reflect the joy of God.Section V: Theological Debate—Questioning the Authority and Consistency of Muhammad’s Words1. Is this Divine Guidance or Human Projection?If Allah is All-Knowing and All-Wise,why would He allow His final prophet to utter and enshrine a saying that ispatently falseby the standards of reason, science, and even basic human happiness?Does this reflect divine omniscience—or merely the psychological disposition and cultural preferences of Muhammad himself?2. Internal Contradictions within IslamQuran 80:39:“Faces that Day will be joyful, laughing, rejoicing at good news.”Even the Qur’an acknowledges laughter and joy in paradise—so why would laughter be deemed “deadly” for the heart on earth?3. Apologetic Rationalizations—A ResponseModern apologists often claim the hadith means “excessive, heedless laughter” that leads to spiritual negligence—not any and all laughter. But the plain text and centuries of interpretation do not qualify it; the statement is universal, unnuanced, and absolute.This post hoc rationalization reveals anembarrassment of inconsistency—the need to reinterpret Muhammad’s words to match observable reality.Section VI: The Verdict of Revelation, Reason, and RealityThe Bible, Science, and Human Experience Are United:Laughter is not a spiritual toxin, but a God-given tonic.Scientific research affirms what Scripture has proclaimed for millennia—joy and laughter are “good medicine.”The Legacy of Prophetic ErrorMuhammad’s myth has led to centuries of cultural suppression of joy and emotional expression in large parts of the Islamic world, with measurable effects on mental health and communal happiness (see Pew Research, 2017).This is not the fruit of the Spirit, nor the intention of a benevolent Creator.Conclusion: Will Muslims Reconsider?If a religion’s teachings are found to be out of harmony with God’s creation and medical science, then the faithful must re-examine thesource of those teachings. The evidence is overwhelming: Muhammad’s statement on laughter is unscientific, unscriptural, and ultimately detrimental to the human spirit. True revelation should lead to human flourishing—not unnecessary sorrow.Will Muslims embrace the joy that God created them for, or cling to a tradition that deadens the heart in the very name of religion?ReferencesHadith and Islamic Law:Al-Adab Al-Mufrad 253, Sahih Muslim 4925, Sunan Ibn Majah 4183, Riyadh as-Salihin 362.Scriptural References:Proverbs 17:22, Ecclesiastes 3:4, Genesis 21:6, Luke 6:21, Galatians 5:22.Medical and Scientific Literature:Berk, L.S. et al.

    "content_preview": "We continue to analyze the arguments in Islamic debates:Today, let us examine the efforts of lecturers in seeking the prophecy of Muhammad, son of Abdullah, in the Bible.The Prophet Isaiah wrote: “Then the book is given to one who is illiterate, saying, ‘Read this, please,’ and he says, ‘I am not literate’” (Isaiah 29:12).When Muslims saw this verse, they thought they had found evidence that Muhammad was prophesied in the Bible because Muhammad was an unlettered person.If you follow the entire 2",
    "full_content": "We continue to analyze the arguments in Islamic debates:Today, let us examine the efforts of lecturers in seeking the prophecy of Muhammad, son of Abdullah, in the Bible.The Prophet Isaiah wrote: “Then the book is given to one who is illiterate, saying, ‘Read this, please,’ and he says, ‘I am not literate’” (Isaiah 29:12).When Muslims saw this verse, they thought they had found evidence that Muhammad was prophesied in the Bible because Muhammad was an unlettered person.If you follow the entire 29th chapter and the context that led to this verse 12, you may end up laughing, although this is not a laughing matter. What Muslims are doing is a great distortion that is leading millions of God's people to eternal destruction in the lake of fire. People are being convinced of lies and embracing them as if they were the truth.Overall, reading chapter 29 is a chapter that pronounces judgment on Ariel (Jerusalem) due to their rebellion against God's laws and commandments, Jehovah. Let us read this chapter carefully:Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city where David dwelt! Add year to year; let feasts come around.Yet I will distress Ariel; there shall be heaviness and sorrow, and it shall be to Me as Ariel.I will encamp against you all around, I will lay siege against you with a mound, and I will raise siege works against you.You shall be brought down, you shall speak out of the ground; your speech shall be low, out of the dust; your voice shall be like a medium’s, out of the ground; and your speech shall whisper out of the dust.Moreover the multitude of your foes shall be like fine dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones like chaff that passes away; yes, it shall be in an instant, suddenly.You will be punished by the Lord of hosts with thunder and earthquake and great noise, with storm and tempest and the flame of devouring fire.The multitude of all the nations who fight against Ariel, even all who fight against her and her fortress, and distress her, shall be as a dream of a night vision.It shall even be as when a hungry man dreams, and look—he eats; but he awakes, and his soul is still empty; or as when a thirsty man dreams, and look—he drinks; but he awakes, and indeed he is faint, and his soul still craves: so the multitude of all the nations shall be, who fight against Mount Zion.Pause and wonder! Blind yourselves and be blind! They are drunk, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with intoxicating drink.For the Lord has poured out on you the spirit of deep sleep and has closed your eyes, namely, the prophets; and He has covered your heads, namely, the seers.Apart from the judgments mentioned above, God continued to say that due to their rebellion, they would not understand His word. That is, they would not be able to hear or know what God is saying even if they read or heard His word. This includes those who are expected to understand this word – namely, the prophets and seers – not to mention those without knowledge of God's word, that is, ordinary people. So, He continues to say:11. The whole vision has become to you like the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one who is literate, saying, “Read this, please”; and he says, “I cannot, for it is sealed”;Then the book is delivered to one who is illiterate, saying, “Read this, please”; and he says, “I am not literate.”Now then, if indeed Muhammad is the one mentioned in Isaiah 29:12, logically, it means he is among those who understand nothing because they are under God's judgment; as we have seen, this chapter is a proclamation of God's judgment due to rebellion. Not bad, though! That is why I said that when you read this argument of the Muslims, you may end up just laughing.But look at this BOOK given to an illiterate person? Now if this book is intended to be the Quran, who are these people who gave Muhammad this book? So the Quran came from PEOPLE giving it to Muhammad?However, since Muhammad is now a prophet who understands nothing due to being under God's judgment according to the logic of this scripture, it means that the message he brought to humanity does not come from the God who created heaven and earth. Yes! Unless, deliberately, you reject the existing logic. Why then should you follow such a person?Make your decisions; your soul is precious, beloved.ShalomDr. Max Shimba, servant of Jesus Christ, the Great God. Titus 2:13",

Aisha said, \"The Prophet said, 'Indeed, your Satan has come to you today!' Aisha asked, 'O Messenger of Allah, do you have a Satan?' He replied, 'Yes, but Allah helped me against him and he became Muslim.'\"Narrated by Aisha: One night, the Prophet was missing and she thought he had gone to one of his wives. She went searching and found him praying in a tent, bowing or prostrating, and murmuring, \"Subhaanaka wa behamdika, laa ilaha illa anta\" (Glory be to You and praise be to You, there is no god except You).The Quran is a Book of Satan Because Muhammad Admitted That Allah is Satan in the Form of an Angel and His Book is the QuranIn Swahili: It is narrated by Anas Ibn Malik: \"I heard the Prophet of Allah saying, 'Allah is Satan in the form of an angel who revealed to me His verses and His book, the Quran, and I am His prophet.' (Umdah Al - Ahkaam: Volume 3, Page 460)In English: Narrated by Anas Ibn Malik: \"I heard from the Apostle of Allah that he said: 'Allah was Satan in the form of an angel that revealed to me the verses and his book, the Quran, and I am his Prophet.' (Umdah Al - Ahkaam: Volume 3, Page 460)In Arabic: رواه أنس ابن مالك: \"سمعت من رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم أنه قال \"كان الله هو شيطان في شكل ملاك كشف لي الآيات وكتابه القرآن وأنا نبي له.\" (عمدة الأحكام المجلد 3، الصفحة 460)The Quran is a Book of Devils and the Devils Work Together with Allah✔Quran 38:36-37: So We subjected the wind to him to blow by his command, gently wherever he directed, and the devils [also] We made subject to him - all kinds of builders and divers.The Quran is a Book of Satan Because Allah Put Great Enmity Between People and Does Not Want Christians to Worship in Spirit and Truth. Look, Allah Even Knows the Sects of Christians Like Roman Catholics, Protestants, and Orthodox✔Quran 5:14: And from those who say, \"We are Christians,\" We took their covenant; but they forgot a portion of that of which they were reminded. So We caused among them enmity and hatred until the Day of Resurrection. And Allah is going to inform them about what they used to do.Explanation of verse 14 to show the greatest conflict and apostasy among Christian sects such as:✔ Roman Catholics✔ Protestants (Seventh-day Adventists, Pentecostals, Anglicans, Lutherans)✔ Orthodox and othersThe Quran is a Book of Satan Because Allah and Muhammad Have Great Hatred Towards Christians and Jews✔Quran 5:51: O you who have believed, do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies. They are [in fact] allies of one another. And whoever is an ally to them among you - then indeed, he is [one] of them. Indeed, Allah guides not the wrongdoing people.The Quran is a Book of Satan Because Allah and Muhammad Have Great Hatred Towards Christians and Jews and Do Not Love Us, and They Forbid Muslims from Attending Christian or Non-Muslim Funerals or Visiting Their Graves✔Quran 9:84: And do not pray [the funeral prayer, O Muhammad], over any of them who has died - ever - or stand at his grave. Indeed, they disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger and died while they were defiantly disobedient.The Quran is a Book of Satan Because Allah Makes Devils Enemies to Prophets Who Are Not From Him. This is Proof Because He Himself is the Unknown God’s Messenger, and That's Why He Prays All the Time, Muhammad Says in Quran 33:56✔Quran 6:112: And thus We have made for every prophet an enemy - devils from mankind and jinn, inspiring to one another decorative speech in delusion. But if your Lord had willed, they would not have done it, so leave them and that which they invent.✔ Allah Prays Like Us to Another God, Muhammad Says, Therefore Allah is Not the Creator of the Heavens and Earth: Question - What is the Name of Allah's God Whom He Worships, and Muhammad's God Whom He Worships, and the God of Muslims?✔Quran 33:56: Indeed, Allah and His angels send blessings upon the Prophet. O you who have believed, ask [Allah to confer] blessing upon him and ask [Allah to grant him] peace.The Quran is a Book of Satan, We Get Proof from Your Book Called Minhajil Muslim, the Guide for Muslim Life, Written by Sheikh Abubakar Jabir Al-Jazair, Translated by Islamic Scholars, Page 589, Ibn Hazm Media Centre, and Also on Page 894, Topic 8 in Aqdu-Dhima (The Relationship Between Believers and Non-Believers)It is written:✔ \"Separating People from the Responsibility of Islam\"✔ What is the Meaning of Dhima?It is an Arabic word meaning the system of communication between human beings (some claim even between intelligent beings).The Quran is a Book of Satan Because Muhammad Commanded That Muslims Should Not Greet Christians and Non-Muslims First✔ The stance on communication for Muslims is stated by Muhammad: \"Do not initiate the greeting to Jews and Christians; if you meet any of them on the road, force them to the narrowest part of it.\" It is necessary to differentiate non-Muslims in appearance so they are recognized by this sign. It is also forbidden to bury non-Muslims in Muslim cemeteries or to stand in respect for them or to greet them, or to sit in the front row at gatherings, according to the words of Prophet Muhammad.The Quran is a Book of Satan Because Muhammad Commanded That It is Forbidden to Build Churches in All Islamic Countries and It is Forbidden to Build Buildings Higher Than the Mosques of MuhammadProhibited Acts in Ahl al-Dhimma (Non-Muslim Rights in Islamic Faith)Ahl al-Dhimma are not allowed to do the following in Islamic countries:It is forbidden to build churches in Islamic countries; this is Muhammad's command.Muhammad said, \"No church shall be built in the Islamic country, nor shall any church be rebuilt that has been destroyed.\" (Al-Mughni by Ibn Qudamah. Nayl al-Awtaar by Shawkani)\"Christians are not allowed to raise their houses higher than Islamic houses (mosques).\" (Baihaqi)This is Why Allah of the Arabs Does Not Want to Be Worshipped or Prostrated to by Any Human Being on Earth, and If You Worship and Prostrate to Allah, Prepare to Go to Hell Where He Will Also Go as per Quran 50:30✔Quran 40:60: And your Lord says, \"Call upon Me; I will respond to you.\" Indeed, those who disdain My worship will enter Hell [rendered] contemptible.The Quran is a Book of Jinn Devils; Here is the Proof. Muhammad is the Prophet of Jinn and Muslim Humans; Therefore, Jinn Devils and Muslim Humans Have Muhammad as Their Prophet and Their Book is the Quran and Their Place of Worship is the Mosque, Quran 72:1-14 and Quran 46:29✔Quran 72:1-14: Say, \"It has been revealed to me that a group of the jinn listened and said, 'Indeed, we have heard an amazing Quran.2. It guides to the right course, and we have believed in it. And we will never associate with our Lord anyone.3. And it teaches that exalted is the nobleness of our Lord; He has not taken a wife or a son.4. And that our foolish one has been saying about Allah an excessive transgression.5. And we had thought that mankind and the jinn would never speak about Allah a lie.6. And there were men from mankind who sought refuge in men from the jinn, so they [only] increased them in burden.7. And they had thought, as you desired, that Allah would never send anyone [as a messenger].8. And we have sought [to reach] the heaven but found it filled with powerful guards and burning flames.9. And we used to sit therein in positions for hearing, but whoever listens now will find a burning flame lying in wait for him.10. And we do not know [therefore] whether evil is intended for those on earth or whether their Lord intends for them a right course.11. And among us are the righteous, and among us are [others] not so; we were [of] divided ways.12. And we have become certain that we will never cause failure to Allah upon earth, nor can we escape Him by flight.13. And when we heard the guidance, we believed in it. And whoever believes in his Lord will not fear deprivation or burden.14. And among us are Muslims [in submission to Allah], and among us are the unjust. And whoever has become Muslim - those have sought out the right course.'\"✔Quran 46:29: And [mention, O Muhammad], when We directed to you a few of the jinn, listening to the Quran. And when they attended it, they said, \"Listen quietly.\" And when it was concluded, they went back to their people as warners.The Quran is a Book of Jinn Devils; Here is the Proof. Muhammad is the Prophet of Jinn and Muslim Humans; Therefore, Jinn Devils and Muslim Humans Have Muhammad as Their Prophet, and Their Book is the Quran, and Their Place of Worship is the Mosque, Quran 46:30-32✔Quran 46:30-32: They said, \"O our people, indeed we have heard a [recited] Book revealed after Moses confirming what was before it which guides to the truth and to a straight path.31. O our people, respond to the Messenger of Allah and believe in him; Allah will forgive for you your sins and protect you from a painful punishment.32. But he who does not respond to the caller of Allah will not cause failure to Him upon earth, and he will not have besides Him any protectors. Those are in manifest error.\"The Quran is a Book of Satan Because Allah Himself Said that He is the Deceiver and He Deceived the Arabs to Believe that Jesus Christ was not Crucified but was Taken Up✔Quran 4:157: And [for] their saying, \"Indeed, we have killed the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, the messenger of Allah.\" And they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him; but [another] was made to resemble him to them. And indeed, those who differ over it are in doubt about it. They have no knowledge of it except the following of assumption. And they did not kill him, for certain.The Quran is a Book of Satan Because Allah Made Jesus Speak Blasphemy About Himself in the Quran✔Quran 3:55: [Mention] when Allah said, \"O Jesus, indeed I will take you and raise you to Myself and purify you from those who disbelieve and make those who follow you [in submission to Allah alone] superior to those who disbelieve until the Day of Resurrection. Then to Me is your return, and I will judge between you concerning that in which you used to differ.The Quran is a Book of Satan Because Allah Made Muhammad Receive Revelations that Led Him to Commit Acts Contrary to God's Laws✔ Muhammad’s marriages and relationships with women are considered by many to be morally questionable. Examples include his marriage to Aisha, a young girl, and his marriage to Zaynab bint Jahsh, the wife of his adopted son Zayd. These actions, justified by revelations in the Quran, raise questions about the nature of the divine inspiration Muhammad received.The Quran is a Book of Satan Because it Contradicts the Bible and Calls for Acts That Are Against Christian Teachings✔ The Quran allows for violence and war against non-believers (Quran 9:5), whereas Jesus taught love, peace, and forgiveness (Matthew 5:39).✔ The Quran permits polygamy (Quran 4:3), while the Bible upholds monogamy as the ideal (Genesis 2:24, Matthew 19:5).The Quran is a Book of Satan Because it Denies the Divinity of Jesus Christ, Which is Central to Christian Faith✔Quran 5:72: They have certainly disbelieved who say, \"Allah is the Messiah, the son of Mary\" while the Messiah has said, \"O Children of Israel, worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.\" Indeed, he who associates others with Allah - Allah has forbidden him Paradise, and his refuge is the Fire. And there are not for the wrongdoers any helpers.ConclusionThe evidence presented above clearly shows that the Quran contains verses and teachings that align with the characteristics of deception, enmity, and opposition to the core beliefs of Christianity. These points illustrate why the Quran is considered by many Christians to be a book of Satan, filled with contradictions and teachings that lead people away from the true God of the Bible.We urge you to carefully consider this evidence and seek the truth. Compare these teachings with the Bible, which consistently promotes love, truth, and the worship of the one true God, Jesus Christ.",

In doing so, they are going against the words of Allah as revealed in the Qur'an. Therefore, it is fair to say they are infidels.Quran 10:47:\"And for every nation there is a messenger. When their messenger comes, it will be judged between them fairly, and they will not be wronged.\"Look at this verse as well:Quran 14:4:\"And We did not send any messenger except [speaking] in the language of his people to state clearly for them, and Allah sends astray [thereby] whom He wills and guides whom He wills. And He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.\"If these verses are true, then Islam is not for non-Arab nations. The Quran says that every people have received their message from God in their own language so they could understand, and the Qur'an was revealed to the Arabs so that the Arabs could understand what Allah is saying.This concept of Allah revealing a book in every language is very important because it is repeated many times and is the basis of this lesson.Quran 16:36:\"And We certainly sent into every nation a messenger, [saying], 'Worship Allah and avoid Taghut.' And among them were those whom Allah guided, and among them were those upon whom error was [deservedly] decreed. So travel through the earth and observe how was the end of the deniers.\"Quran 5:48:\"And We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad], the Book in truth, confirming that which preceded it of the Scripture and as a criterion over it. So judge between them by what Allah has revealed and do not follow their inclinations away from what has come to you of the truth. To each of you We prescribed a law and a method. Had Allah willed, He would have made you one nation [united in religion], but [He intended] to test you in what He has given you; so race to [all that is] good. To Allah is your return all together, and He will [then] inform you concerning that over which you used to differ.\"Quran 36:5-6:\"[This is] a revelation of the Exalted in Might, the Merciful, That you may warn a people whose forefathers were not warned, so they are unaware.\"These verses are complete and clearly explain that Muhammad came only for the Arabs. Allah in the Quran says that every people had their own messenger who warned them in their own language, and that he sent Muhammad to those who had not yet started any guidance and whose forefathers were not warned, meaning the Arabs. In this way, they would have no excuse and could not say, \"But we never received any message.\"Continue reading the Quran here:Quran 6:156-157:\"[We sent] lest you say, 'The Scripture was only sent down to two groups before us, but we were of their study unaware,' Or lest you say, 'If only the Scripture had been revealed to us, we would have been better guided than they.' So there has [now] come to you a clear evidence from your Lord and a guidance and mercy. Then who is more unjust than one who denies the verses of Allah and turns away from them? We will recompense those who turn away from Our verses with the worst of punishment for their having turned away.\"The Quran was clearly sent to the Arabs. Those who are not Arabs cannot understand the Quran, those are the words of Allah. Muslims insist that no translation of the Quran can be accurate. Therefore, it can never be clear to non-Arabic speaking nations and was not sent to non-Arab nations.Another proof that the Quran was sent only for the Arabs is in the following verses:Quran 26:198-199:\"And if We had revealed it to one of the non-Arabs, And he had recited it to them, they would [still] not have been believers in it.\"Just as the Arabs have the right not to believe any book sent in a language other than their own, meaning Arabic, similarly, non-Arabic speaking nations have the right not to believe the Quran, a book written in Arabic. That is why the Quran says Allah will send a messenger in every language so that they themselves can understand.To ensure there is no misunderstanding, Allah reveals this verse:Quran 5:19:\"O People of the Scripture, there has come to you Our Messenger to make clear to you [the religion] after a period [of suspension] of messengers, lest you say, 'There came not to us any bringer of good tidings or a warner.' But there has come to you a bringer of good tidings and a warner. And Allah is over all things competent.\"According to the Qur'an, all people have received revelation. The above verse says the Qur'an is for those who never received revelation, so they may not say, `We never received any bringer of good tidings or any warner sent to us.'This matter is clear, but Allah wants it to be clear even to the least knowledgeable that the Quran was sent to the Arabs only by mentioning the exact geographical locations where Muhammad was sent as the Prophet of Allah.Today, we have learned that the Quran was sent only for the Arabs and not for all nations. Now, I am sure some Muslims may bring up other verses that say Islam is for all mankind. If Muslims do so, then they acknowledge that the verses mentioned above are false.Either the Quran is a package of lies and contradictions, or it is just for the Arabs of Mecca and its surrounding areas as Allah, the god of Muslims, said.In service,Max Shimba, a servant of Jesus Christ, our Great God, and Savior.Copyright © Max Shimba Ministries 2013",

Allah says that he has already judged all Muslims and must fulfill this judgment of all Muslims entering hell.People, what is so difficult or hard to understand here? Why is it that Allah has already declared that all Muslims will enter hell?I know Muslims will start to argue, saying, \"Oh, you do not understand the Quran,\" or \"Oh, you have misinterpreted the verse.\" Let me add more verses from their Quran that further confirm this.SURAT AT-TAKAATHUR, which was revealed in Mecca, tells Muslims:3. No! You are going to know!4. Again, no! You are going to know!5. No! If you only knew with knowledge of certainty,6. You will surely see Hellfire!Allah tells Muslims \"No!\" meaning that what Muslims understand is not correct. Remember, these verses were revealed by Allah to his Prophet Muhammad. Allah tells Muhammad, \"Verse 3: No! You are going to know!\"SO WHY DOESN'T ALLAH TELL MUHAMMAD THE TRUTH DIRECTLY? Why does Allah wait until the Day of Judgment for Muslims to know that Allah is fake and is sending them to hell? This is a great tragedy.MUSLIMS HAVE BEEN DECEIVED:Muslims claim they will enter the hereafter - ALLAH RESPONDS in Surat Al Takaathur, verse 6: You will surely see Hellfire!Muslims claim they follow the religion of the Almighty God. ALLAH RESPONDS in Surat Al Takaathur, verse 3: No! You are going to know!Muslims claim that Islam is the religion of Almighty God. ALLAH RESPONDS in Surat Al Takaathur, verse 4: Again, no! You are going to know!Muslims say that the Quran is the book of the Almighty God. ALLAH RESPONDS by saying in Surat Al Takaathur, verse 5: No! If you only knew with knowledge of certainty,My dear friends, what is so difficult about these verses? They are very clear, and already Allah has started to disown Muslims by saying \"No.\"ALLAH HAS ALREADY SAID THAT WHAT MUSLIMS KNOW IS NOT CORRECT.Allah says to Muslims in Quran Surah 19:71: And there is none among you Muslims but will arrive at it. This is a decree of your Lord which must be accomplished.A SENSIBLE CHRISTIAN WOULD NEVER AGREE TO BE IN THIS GROUP OF HELL.Muslims, I invite you to Jesus, who does not send people to hell.SO MUHAMMAD AND ALL MUSLIMS WILL ENTER HELL?Come today and receive eternal life.God bless you greatly.It is I, Max Shimba, a servant of Jesus Christ, the Almighty God.

Without wasting time, start reading his authentic hadiths.Sahih Bukhari 1:3:63He made his camel kneel in the mosque, then tied its leg with a rope, and then asked, \"Who among you is the Prophet Muhammad?\" At that time the Prophet was sitting among us (his companions) leaning on his arm. We replied, \"This WHITE man who is leaning on his arm is Muhammad.\" Then he said, \"O son of 'Abdul Muttalib.\"Volume 4, Book 56, Number 744:Narrated Isma'il bin Abi Khalid:I heard Abii Juhaifa say: I saw the Prophet of Allah, and Al-Hasan bin 'Ali resembled him. I asked Abu-Juhaifa, tell me about him. He replied that the Prophet of Allah was a white man with black and slightly grey hair in his beard. He promised to give us 13 she-camels, but the Prophet of Allah died before fulfilling his promise.So, the Prophet of Allah was white. That's why Allah does not like Africans and calls them infidels.Volume 2, Book 17, Number 122:Narrated 'Abdullah bin Dinar:My father said, \"I heard Ibn 'Umar reciting the poetry of Abu Talib: And a WHITE man (meaning the Prophet) to whom we turn to for rain, the caretaker of orphans, and the protector of widows.\"Volume 2, Book 17, Number 141:Narrated Anas bin Malik:The Prophet never raised his hands for any prayer except for the prayer of Istisqa' (asking for rain) and he would raise them so high that the whiteness of his armpits could be seen.Volume 1, Book 8, Number 367:The Prophet of Allah showed his thighs, and I saw the whiteness of his thighs.I hope you have read those hadiths about Muhammad and learned something about the ethnicity or nationality of the Prophet of Allah. Muhammad was white, and we do not read anywhere that he denied his whiteness.Why did the early Muslims say that Muhammad was white?Why did Muhammad not deny claims of him being white?SO MUHAMMAD WAS WHITE AND NOT AN ARABGod bless you greatly,In His Service,Max Shimba Ministries Org.MAX SHIMBA MINISTRIES ORG ©2015.

Muslims claim that, in this verse, Jesus denies being \"GOOD\" and asserts that only God is Good. Therefore, they argue that Jesus' denial of being Good contradicts the Christian claim that Jesus is God.You will see that these Islamic preachers teach the community using the Quran and the Bible, stating that Jesus denied being GOOD. They spread this teaching of \"ONLY GOD IS GOOD\" through various media such as radio, pamphlets, debates, books, and video and audio tapes. This has led some Christians to abandon their faith and convert to Islam. Other Christians, although not converting, still believe this teaching. The crucial question every Christian should ask is whether Jesus truly denied being GOOD. I urge you to follow this lesson carefully to understand the truth of this verse:Luke 18:18-19: \"A certain ruler asked him, 'Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?' Jesus replied, 'Why do you call me good? No one is good—except God alone.'\"If you quickly look at how these Islamic preachers teach this Bible verse, you might be convinced to believe what they are teaching. But it is good to study deeply the response of Jesus saying \"Only God is Good\" and see if there is any truth in their teaching that Jesus denied being Good, thus not being God.Let us start our research.In this verse above, did Jesus give an answer or ask a question? Here we see the verses clearly teaching us that Jesus asked a question and did not deny being Good.QUOTE: Jesus replied, 'Why do you call me good?' Here, Jesus asked a question to the person who called him \"GOOD TEACHER\" and did not deny being \"GOOD\" as taught by Islamic preachers in their religious debates.After the person failed to answer why he called Jesus \"Good Teacher,\" Jesus said the following:No one is Good—except God alone. Did Jesus, when saying these words, deny being God?MUSLIMS AGREE THAT ONLY GOD IS GOOD.Is there any part of the Bible where Jesus calls himself Good? Now let us read Jesus in the Gospel of John 10:14Jesus says the following:\"14 I am the Good Shepherd; I know my sheep and my sheep know me.\"IN JOHN, JESUS CALLS HIMSELF GOOD.Therefore, according to Muslims' acceptance that \"ONLY GOD IS GOOD\" and Jesus calling himself Good in the Gospel of John 10:14, today Jesus has answered Islamic preachers that he is Good. Therefore, this title of Good makes him God, according to Luke 18:18-19, \"Only God is Good.\"I hope that today you have understood deeply the meaning of \"Only God is Good\" and that when Jesus said this, he was informing the young man that he is God, and the young man did not make a mistake when he called him GOOD TEACHER.Now, where is the verse where Allah says he is Good?Dr. Max Shimba for Max Shimba MinistriesCopyright © Max Shimba Ministries 2013",

    "full_content": "KNOW THE RELIGION OF ISLAM AND ITS ROOTSIntroductionFor many years, Muslims worldwide have urged Christians to abandon their faith and join Islam. Muslims claim that their religion is the true path before Almighty God and assert that all prophets were Muslims. They even claim that Jesus Himself was a Muslim and that Islam did not adopt or inherit any idolatrous, pagan, or ignorant practices. They argue that Islam is the purest religion. The crucial question is, is it true that Islam did not adopt any idolatrous, pagan, or ignorant practices? To understand this fully, follow this study written by my teacher Evangelist Kobelo and revised by me, Teacher Chaka.Five Main Parts of the StudyWere all the prophets Muslims?The meaning of the word \"Islam.\"Who brought the religion of Islam?Did Islam adopt the practices of the Arabs from the Age of Ignorance?The duty of a Christian after learning about Islam.1. Were all the prophets Muslims?A major argument by Muslims is urging Christians to accept Islam by claiming that all of God’s prophets were Muslims. However, it is important first to examine Islamic books about the arrival of the Quran and what it teaches. Who brought this religion? According to the Quran, as believed by Muslims, it states:Quran 6:14 (Surah Al-An'am - The Cattle)Say: \"Indeed, I have been commanded to be the first among those who submit (to Allah).\"In this verse, we see that Muhammad was the first person commanded to submit to Islam.It is also narrated that Muhammad (SAW) said, \"We Muslims are the last to come.\" This is found in Sahih Al-Bukhari vol. ix Hadith no. 587.Muhammad also told his followers to follow the ways of those who came before them, saying, \"Country by country, step by step, even if they entered a lizard’s hole.\" His companions asked, \"The Jews and the Christians?\" He replied, \"Who else?\" This is found in Sahih Muslim vol. iv in Al-Ilm, Hadith no. 6448. From this response by Muhammad (SAW), it is clear that the religion of Islam was preceded by our Christian faith and even the Jewish religion.Prophets of Jehovah God followed this religion (way).When we read the Holy Scriptures, the Bible teaches us that the prophets were led by this:1 Peter 1:10-11Concerning this salvation, the prophets, who spoke of the grace that was to come to you, searched intently and with the greatest care, trying to find out the time and circumstances to which the Spirit of Christ in them was pointing.1 Corinthians 10:1-4For I do not want you to be ignorant of the fact, brothers and sisters, that our ancestors were all under the cloud and that they all passed through the sea. They were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea. They all ate the same spiritual food and drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank from the spiritual rock that accompanied them, and that rock was Christ.In these verses, we see clearly that all the prophets were led by the Spirit of Christ Jesus, who was within them. Moses and his people were also followed by Christ, who fed and gave them drink. They were all led by the Lord Jesus, who Himself called them \"people of Christ.\" See Mark 9:38-41. This is because the Lord Jesus is our leader. See Matthew 23:9. Furthermore, Jesus is the way (religion), the truth, and the life (John 14:6). Thus, all the prophets were people of Christ because His Spirit was within them, leading them.2. The Meaning of the Word IslamThe word Islam is Arabic and means \"Submission\" or \"Peace.\" In the Quran, the word Islam is mentioned 38 times. Although the word Islam is mentioned frequently, it is different from the religion of Islam. This is because the religion of Islam means submission under the commands of Allah or peace under Allah’s laws. According to the Quran, as believed by Muslims, it states concerning Muhammad (SAW):Quran 6:163 (Surah Al-An'am - The Cattle)\"And I am commanded to be the first of those who submit (to Allah).\"Quran 39:12 (Surah Az-Zumar - The Troops)\"And I am commanded to be the first of those who submit (to Allah).\"3. Who Brought the Religion of Islam?When we read the explanation of verses 19-20 in Surah Yusuf found in the Swahili translation of the Quran, Juzuu 12, 3rd edition, page 311, it explains who brought the religion of Islam to this world. The words are:\"First of all, more than 4,000 years before the advent of the religion of Islam brought by the Prophet Muhammad, they used to call Islam the religion that came to sell people.\"According to this explanation in the Quran, the testimonies of the famous books of hadith by Muhammad in Sahih Al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim, and various books written by Islamic scholars, it is clear that the religion of Islam was brought and established by Muhammad (SAW). A good example of the beginning of the religion of Islam is found in the book titled \"The Life of Prophet Muhammad (SAW)\" written by the former Chief Kadhi of Zanzibar and later Kenya, the late Sheikh Abdullah Saleh Al-Farsy. On page 18, it describes Muhammad’s wife Khadija bint Khuwaylid:\"He returned to his wife Lady Khadija and narrated the incident to her. She believed him immediately, becoming the first person to bear witness to the testimony of Islam. Thus, the first Muslim was a woman.\"In the same book, \"The Life of Prophet Muhammad,\" on page 18, section C, the first Muslims are mentioned:(i) The First MuslimLady Khadija bint KhuwaylidThe Prophet was commanded to teach the religion on a Monday, and Lady Khadija accepted Islam that same day, performing prayers with the Prophet that very night before anyone else in the world. She is truly fortunate.(ii) The Second MuslimSayyidina Ali bin Abi Talib bin Abdul MuttalibHe saw the Prophet and Lady Khadija performing prayers that night and asked, \"What is this worship?\" The Prophet explained and invited him to join, but he initially refused, saying he needed to consult his father. The Prophet forbade him from disclosing the secret. The next morning, the young man returned to the Prophet and declared that he would join them, becoming the second Muslim in the world. He was about 10 years old when he embraced Islam.(iii) The Third and Fourth MuslimsZayd bin Haritha Al-Ka'bi and Lady AymanA free man and the adopted son of the Prophet, Zayd bin Haritha lived with the Prophet and accepted Islam like Sayyidina Ali on Tuesday. He and his wife, Lady Umm Ayman, the nurse of the Prophet, embraced Islam together.These were the earliest Muslims who embraced Islam immediately after Muhammad (SAW) brought the religion of Islam, which he officially established on Monday, the 17th day of Ramadan, equivalent to December 27, 610 AD. Before Muhammad, the religion of Islam did not exist in the world.4. Did Islam Adopt the Practices of the Arabs from the Age of Ignorance?During the Age of Ignorance, before the advent of Islam, the Quraysh tribe, which was Muhammad's tribe, and other Arabs worshipped many gods, about 360 in total. The practice of worshipping many gods is clearly described in the Quran and various Islamic books written by scholars. Some of these books include:(i) Scholar Sayyid Abul A'la MaududiIn his book \"Towards Understanding Islam,\" pages 42-44, he states: \"In the Arabian Peninsula, where darkness prevailed, Arab traders traveled long distances and found it difficult to obtain even a shred of education. Those who could read and write worshipped stones, trees, idols, stars, and spirits; in short, anything that crossed their minds. They knew nothing about the teachings of the prophets who preceded them. They believed that Abraham and Ishmael were their ancestors, but they knew nothing about their religious teachings and the God they worshipped.\"(ii) Sheikh Abdullah Saleh Al-Farsy, former Chief Kadhi of Zanzibar and later KenyaIn his book \"The Life of Prophet Muhammad (SAW),\" page 6, he states: \"Even before the advent of Islam, Christian priests and Jewish rabbis living in the Arabian Peninsula used to warn their Arab neighbors who worshipped idols.\"The Quran mentions various gods worshipped by the Quraysh and other Arabs during the Age of Ignorance:(i) Worship of idolsQuran 25:43-44 (Surah Al-Furqan - The Criterion)\"Have you seen the one who takes his own desires as his god? Would you then be a guardian over him? Or do you think that most of them hear or understand? They are like cattle; no, they are even farther astray from the path.\"The explanation of verse 43 in Juzuu 19 of the Quran states: \"The Arabs, in their ignorance, worshipped a multitude of gods. Some of them would worship anything that pleased them, even a cake that looked appealing.\"Here, we see that the Quran openly describes the Arabs worshipping even a cake and calls them ignorant \"Jahili.\"(ii) Worship of stone idolsQuran 71:22-23 (Surah Nuh - Noah)\"And they have plotted a mighty plot. And they said (to their followers): 'Do not abandon your gods; do not abandon Wadd, nor Suwa', nor Yaghuth, nor Ya'uq, nor Nasr (names of their idols).\"These are false stone idols worshipped by the Arabs. The god Wadd had the form of a woman, Yaghuth the form of a lion, and Ya'uq the form of a horse. These details are found in the book \"History of Islam\" written by Prof. Masudul Hassan, page 43.(iii) Worship of the gods Lat, Uzza, and ManatQuran 53:18-20, 23 (Surah An-Najm - The Star)\"Indeed, he (Muhammad) saw of the greatest signs of his Lord. Have you then considered Lat and Uzza, and another, the third (goddess), Manat? What! For you the males and for Him the females?\"(iv) Worship of Allah by the Jahili ArabsThe Quraysh and their fellow Arabs, who worshipped many gods, including 360 idols, also worshipped Allah as the chief god. They believed that Lat, Uzza, and Manat were the female deities or daughters of Allah. This is confirmed in the explanation of verse 180 in Surah Al-A'raf and the book \"History of Islam\" written by Prof. Masudul Hassan, page 43.Evidence of the worship of Allah by the Jahili Arabs:(i) Birth of Muhammad (SAW)The prayers and supplications of Abdul Muttalib to Allah.When we read the book \"The Life of Muhammad (SAW)\" written by Sheikh Farsy, page 5, it states: \"When the Prophet was born at dawn, his grandfather was called to see his grandson. He was very happy and wrapped the newborn in clothes, carrying him to the Kaaba. He opened the door, entered, and stood praying and supplicating with beautiful Arabic poetry that he composed at that moment. Then he returned with the baby before the sun had risen.\"Another clear evidence showing that Muhammad's father, Abdul Muttalib, prayed to Allah can be found in the introduction to Surah Al-Fil in Juzuu 30, page 946 of the Swahili translation of the Quran, which reads: \"The chief of Mecca at that time was Abdul Muttalib. He went to the Kaaba with some Quraysh chiefs, held the iron latch of the Kaaba's door, and asked Allah (SWT) to protect His house and its servants. At that time, there were 360 idols inside and around the Kaaba.\"(v) The beliefs of Abdul MuttalibIn a book written by a renowned Islamic scholar named Al-Muhsin Barwani, page 153, it states: \"There was no Arab given that name by his grandfather from birth, and that grandfather was not a Christian but followed pagan customs. He did not know the Torah or the Gospel.\"(vi) Muhammad's encouragement to the Quraysh about the god called AllahIn the book \"The Truthful Faithful\" written by Sheikh Said Moosa Muhammad Al-Kindy, volumes 1 and 2, 10th edition, page 130, it states: \"Before receiving prophethood, the Prophet (SAW) used to tell people, 'O people, say Laa ilaha illa Allah, you will succeed.'\"This is clear evidence that Allah was worshipped by the Quraysh and their fellow Arabs, who were polytheists, pagans, and ignorant. Remember, Muhammad was a Quraysh, and when he said, \"There is no god but Allah,\" he was in the Age of Ignorance and did not know the book or faith (Quran 42:52 Surah Ash-Shura).(vii) The god worshipped by Muslims - what is His name?Quran 17:110 (Surah Al-Isra - The Night Journey)Say, \"Call upon Allah or call upon the Most Merciful. Whichever (name) you call - to Him belong the best names.\" And do not recite too loudly in your prayer or too quietly but seek a way between.In this verse, we see that the god worshipped by Muslims is called Allah. In the Quran, this name is mentioned 2,866 times. Remember, the Quraysh and their fellow Arabs worshipped this god called Allah. The crucial question is, did the Muslims not inherit the god of the Quraysh? Reflect on this carefully.(viii) The main city of the Quraysh and their fellow Arabs during the Age of Ignorance where they used to go for pilgrimage is this:When we read the introduction to Surah Quraysh in Juzuu 30, pages 950-951 of the Swahili translation of the Quran, it states: \"The Quraysh tribe was scattered throughout Hijaz until the time of Qusayy bin Kilab, one of the ancestors of the Prophet (SAW). First of all, Qusayy gathered the Quraysh together in Mecca, making the tribe the custodians of the Kaaba. Because of this, Qusayy was called 'the gatherer of people.' He established a government in Mecca and arranged provisions for pilgrims coming from all over Arabia. As a result, the Quraysh gained great fame among the Arab tribes.\"Here, we see that during the Age of Ignorance and paganism, before the advent of Islam, all the Arabs went for pilgrimage in the city of Mecca to the Kaaba, known as \"Baitullah\" or the House of Allah. Remember, this same house was where the pagan Arabs worshipped 360 idols, and Allah was their chief god.The main city for Muslim pilgrimage is this:Quran 3:96 (Surah Al-Imran - The Family of Imran)Indeed, the first House (of worship) established for mankind was that at Mecca - blessed and a guidance for the worlds.Quran 22:27-29 (Surah Al-Hajj - The Pilgrimage)And proclaim to the people the Hajj (pilgrimage); they will come to you on foot and on every lean camel; they will come from every distant pass - That they may witness benefits for themselves and mention the name of Allah on known days over what He has provided for them of (sacrificial) animals. So eat of them and feed the miserable and poor. Then let them end their untidiness and fulfill their vows and perform Tawaf around the ancient House (the Kaaba).When we read the explanation of verse 29 in Juzuu 17 of the Quran, it states: \"Before Islam, the Arabs highly respected the Kaaba. It was an ancient building, so they called it Al-Baytul 'Atiq, meaning the ancient house.\"Just as the pagan Arabs had Mecca as their main pilgrimage city, so do Muslims. Moreover, the Quran describes Mecca as the mother of cities (Quran 6:92 Surah Al-An'am). Muslims worldwide are instructed to face a specific direction during their prayers:Quran 7:29 (Surah Al-A'raf)Say: My Lord has commanded justice, and that you should stand upright before Him at every place of worship...Where is this place to face during prayers?Quran 27:91 (Surah An-Naml - The Ant)Indeed, I have been commanded to worship the Lord of this city (Mecca), who made it sacred...According to these verses, the Quran describes that the Lord of this city (Mecca) is Allah, who was worshipped by the Quraysh and their fellow Arabs during the Age of Ignorance.In their worship, Muslims face towards the Kaaba in Mecca:Quran 2:144-150The Lord of Mecca is Allah, who was worshipped by the pagan Arabs during the Age of Ignorance, and He is the same one worshipped by Muslims.(ix) Circling the Kaaba naked during worship:Before the advent of Islam, the Quraysh and their fellow Arabs used to circle the Kaaba, \"Baitullah,\" naked. This is described in the book \"The Life of Muhammad,\" page 4, written by Sheikh Abdullah Saleh Al-Farsy, who was the Chief Kadhi of Zanzibar and later of Kenya. Not only Farsy wrote about this, but also the renowned scholar Abul A'la Maududi in his book \"Towards Understanding Islam,\" page 43, described the Arabs as follows: Their lives were wild, and their conduct was barbaric. They celebrated fornication, gambling, and drunkenness. Robbery and seizing women by force were their habits. They could stand naked in front of their peers without feeling shame or disgrace. Even their women would circle the Kaaba naked. They killed their daughters to protect their honor and married their stepmothers after their fathers died. They were ignorant even about basic matters like eating, dressing, and washing. Regarding their religious beliefs, they were afflicted with the same disease of wickedness that was spreading worldwide.Remember, Allah was the god worshipped by these Arabs, and their house of worship was the Kaaba. Surprisingly, scholar Abul A'la Maududi says that these Arabs were afflicted with the wickedness that was destroying the world. The question is, did circling the Kaaba and worshiping Allah lead to the world's destruction?Do Muslims circle the Kaaba during their pilgrimage?Before we learn about what Muslims do at the Kaaba, we need to know what the Kaaba is like. The word Kaaba is Arabic, meaning a cube-shaped structure. The Kaaba is a building with a length of 12 meters, a width of 10 meters, and a height of 15 meters. This building is in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. The building is covered with black curtains embroidered with Quranic verses in Arabic using real gold thread. In the eastern corner of the Kaaba, there is a black stone known in Arabic as \"Hajar al-Aswad.\"The Quran instructs Muslims to perform their pilgrimage rituals at the Kaaba:(i) Circling the Kaaba:Quran 22:29 (Surah Al-Hajj - The Pilgrimage)\"Then let them remove their untidiness and fulfill their vows and circumambulate the ancient House (the Kaaba).\"According to this verse, Allah instructs Muslims to circle the Kaaba. Earlier, we saw that the pagan Arabs circled the Kaaba naked. How do Muslims circle the Kaaba?In the book \"How to Perform Hajj,\" written by scholar A. Suleimani, page 16, it states: \"It is forbidden for a man in Ihram (pilgrimage clothes) to wear sewn clothes. Sewing here means for wearing, not for patching. An Ihram consists of two unstitched garments like sheets.\"According to these instructions, during their pilgrimage, Muslims circle the Kaaba wearing unstitched garments called \"Ihram,\" which are two white sheets.(x) Worship involving touching, kissing, and revering the black stone \"Hajar al-Aswad\" in the Kaaba mosque in Mecca:The Quraysh and their fellow Arabs before Islam highly respected the house of Allah, the Kaaba, and the black stone \"Hajar al-Aswad.\" This reverence is mentioned in the book \"The Life of Muhammad,\" page 15-16, written by Sheikh Abdullah Saleh Al-Farsy:\"Building of the Kaaba: When the Prophet was 35 years old, the Kaaba had large cracks and was about to collapse. The Quraysh decided to demolish and rebuild it. The Kaaba had no roof... But when it came to placing the black stone 'Hajar al-Aswad' in its place between the southern and eastern walls, they fought over who should place it. The dispute lasted for five days, awaiting a fight. Then, by good fortune, the Prophet entered, although he had not yet received prophethood. Everyone unanimously said, 'This is the trustworthy one, and we all agree.' The Prophet took the stone and placed it in his cloak. He called each tribe leader to hold the cloak, and together they carried it to its place. The Prophet then placed the stone with his hands, to everyone's satisfaction.\"This evidence shows that the Quraysh and their fellow Arabs before Islam highly respected the Kaaba and the black stone inside it, where they circled it naked. Even Muhammad participated in this, as he placed the stone himself, with the agreement of the Quraysh. The crucial question is, did Muslims not inherit these rituals of ignorance? Continue...Do Muslims perform the worship of touching, kissing, and revering the black stone \"Hajar al-Aswad\"?When we read various Islamic books, we see how Muslims perform the ritual of revering the black stone in the main mosque of Mecca known as the Kaaba or \"Baitullah\" - the House of Allah. Some of these books include:**In the book \"The Truthful Faithful,\" written by Sheikh Said Moosa Muhammad Al-Kindy, volumes 1 and 2, 10th edition, page 75, it states: \"The Prophet (SAW) said: 'The black stone is from Paradise. Whoever touches it, his sins are forgiven.'\"In the book \"How to Perform Hajj,\" written by A. Suleiman, pages 29-30, it states: \"Before starting to circle the Kaaba, it is recommended to first go to the black stone 'Hajar al-Aswad,' located in the Kaaba. Approach it as close as possible without harming others. Face the black stone, touch it, and kiss it three times, and touch your forehead to it three times. This is a Sunnah if there is no crowd. If you cannot reach it, gesture towards it with your hand. Then return to the black stone, touch it, kiss it three times, and touch your forehead to it three times as before. Then say 'Allahu Akbar' three times (while gesturing towards the black stone with both hands). Then add, 'O Allah, with faith in You, belief in Your Book, fulfillment of Your promise, and following the Sunnah of Your Prophet, peace be upon him.' After this, continue circling the entire Kaaba.\"**Remember, the act of circling the Kaaba was done by the pagan Arabs during the Age of Ignorance before the advent of Islam. Now, Muslims also circle the Kaaba. The question is, did Muslims not inherit the rituals of the Age of Ignorance? Reflect on this.What does our God Jehovah teach us about the worship of stones?Leviticus 26:1\"Do not make idols or set up an image or a sacred stone for yourselves, and do not place a carved stone in your land to bow down before it. I am the Lord your God.\"According to the teachings of our God Jehovah, whom Christians worship, it is a great sin to take a stone and bow down to it. Reflect on the actions of Muslims concerning the black stone \"Hajar al-Aswad.\"(xi) Worship involving circling the hills of Safa and Marwa in Mecca before Islam:Quran 2:158 (Surah Al-Baqarah - The Cow)\"Indeed, Safa and Marwa are among the symbols of Allah. So whoever makes Hajj to the House or performs Umrah, there is no blame upon him for walking between them. And whoever volunteers good, indeed, Allah is appreciative and Knowing.\"The explanation of verse 158 states: \"Among the acts of worship that are not valid except in Mecca are these: (a) Hajj and (b) Umrah. Both are almost identical except for a few differences. One of their differences is that Hajj can only be performed in specific months, and the last month of Hajj is the first ten days of the month of Dhul-Hijjah. Other than that, both involve: (1) Circling the Kaaba seven times, (2) Running seven times between the hills of Safa and Marwa, (3) Shaving or cutting the hair. The hills had idols placed on them, and the pagans worshipped them. When Islam came, some Muslims thought it was inappropriate to perform worship at these hills. They were told it was not wrong.\"The details of this explanation are similar to those in Sahih Al-Bukhari vol. ii, pages 415-416, Hadith no. 710, where Asim asked Anas bin Malik (A.S.) if they used to dislike performing Tawaf (circumambulation) between Safa and Marwa. He replied, \"Yes, because it was a custom during the Age of Ignorance before the advent of Islam.\" It is also narrated that Muhammad performed Tawaf of the Kaaba and Sa'i between Safa and Marwa to demonstrate his strength over Safa and Marwa. This is mentioned in Sahih Al-Bukhari vol. ii Hadith no. 711. The surprising thing is that this ritual was performed by pagans during the Age of Ignorance, and Muslims also circle the hills. Furthermore, it is astonishing to see Allah, the god worshipped by Muslims, calling these hills symbols of Allah. This is strange to see hills called that.What does the Lord Jesus teach us about the worship of hills?John 4:19-22\"The woman said to him, 'Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet. Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you say that in Jerusalem is the place where people ought to worship.' Jesus said to her, 'Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father. You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews.'\"In these verses, the Lord Jesus tells us that those who worship on the mountain do not know what they are worshiping. Reflect on the worship of Muslims at the hills, do they know what they are worshiping?(xii) The month of Ramadan:When we read the book \"The Life of Muhammad,\" page 32, written by Sheikh Farsy, we see that the months used by the Arabs before Islam are the same ones used by Muslims. The book states: \"Mecca, since before Islam, was a sacred place for all Arabs. Every year they would come to make pilgrimage in these same months that Muslims now use for their pilgrimage.\"The Arabs were pagans and polytheists, and they had the month of Ramadan, which Muslims believe was the month Muhammad received prophethood. See \"The Life of Muhammad,\" pages 16-17.The worship of fasting in the month of Ramadan for Muslims:Quran 2:183 (Surah Al-Baqarah - The Cow)\"O you who have believed, decreed upon you is fasting as it was decreed upon those before you that you may become righteous.\"It is mentioned in Sahih Bukhari vol. ii Hadith 662, vol. iii Hadith no. 219 and 220, and vol. vi Hadith no. 31 that Muhammad commanded Muslims to fast on the day of Ashura, the tenth day of the first month in the Islamic year, called Muharram. Fasting before Islam was a custom in the religion of Hums, and Islam adopted it.(xiii) Stoning Satan in the valley of Wadi Muhassir:Among the significant rituals performed by Muslims during their pilgrimage in Mecca is stoning Satan. The book \"How to Perform Hajj,\" pages 54, 55, 61, states: \"Pilgrims, upon reaching the valley called Wadi Muhassir near Mina, it is Sunnah to hurry. They proceed to Jamrat al-Aqaba (the big Satan) and throw seven stones they collected in Muzdalifah. After stoning Jamrat al-Aqaba, it is followed by slaughtering.\"For us Christians, we know Satan is a spirit of rebellion (Ephesians 2:1-5) and a spirit of deceit (1 Timothy 4:1-2). Therefore, you cannot defeat Satan by throwing stones at him because he is a spirit. A spirit is wind or breath. The Bible teaches us that we defeat Satan through the correct faith in God, holding onto the word of God, fasting, and prayer. Thus, we will overcome Satan (Ephesians 6:11-18).5. The Duty of a Christian After Knowing About IslamI believe you have learned a lot about the religion of Islam and have seen many things done by Muslims in Mecca during their pilgrimage. Those practices were performed by the Quraysh and their fellow Arabs before the advent of Islam, and again you have seen that the God we worship as Christians does not want worship involving stones and hills. Therefore, your duty as a Christian is to share the Gospel with Muslims and people of other religions that do not believe in the Lord Jesus so that they may believe and be saved. Remember, the Gospel is the power of God that brings salvation (Romans 1:16). Additionally, the Gospel is the word of truth (Colossians 1:5). God bless you greatly.

Believe it or not, here is the truth laid out for you today.On the 10th day of Dhu al-Hijjah, pilgrims leave Muzdalifah, collecting stones along the way. According to the Sunnah, on this first day (the 10th), they are allowed to collect only seven stones. You might be wondering, what are these stones for, and where are the Muslims heading? Continue reading to understand this bizarre ritual.Times for Stoning Satan:On the Day of An-Nahr – the first day of the festival, do not throw stones until the sun has risen:“The Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) while at Muzdalifah, allowed the weak, elderly, and women to move to Mina before others and instructed them not to stone (the Jamaraat) until after the sun has risen.” [Reported by At-Tirmidhiy]One with a valid excuse may delay stoning until just before sunset, but it is best to stone after the sun has risen and before it sets for those without an excuse. (Some scholars permit stoning after sunset for valid reasons, but it is better to try to stone before sunset).The stoning should be done after Zawal (noon when the sun has moved slightly from its zenith) on the remaining two or three days for those not in a hurry.AT MINA, THE STONING OF SATAN BEGINS:Pilgrims throw seven stones at 'Jamrat Al-Aqabah'. Pilgrims throw stones at Satan in the place known as “Mina” near Mecca. Dear readers, it turns out Satan resides in Mecca. The pilgrims engage in this ritual of stoning Satan.Pilgrims return to Mina and stone Satan again, staying overnight on the 11th and 12th days.Does Satan have a physical body that can be hit with stones? Can’t Allah defeat Satan without human intervention? This ritual raises serious doubts about this aspect of Islam.Pilgrims perform this stoning ritual on the 11th, 12th, and 13th days, and they do it at night, not during the day.This clearly shows that Satan is considered part of this religion.Dua After Stoning:It is recommended to face the Qiblah and make dua after stoning each Jamaraat except the last one. A hadith narrated by Al-Bukhari and Imam Ahmad states:“The Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) after stoning each Jamaraat with seven pebbles, would stand facing the Qiblah and make dua, except after stoning the last Jamaraat.” [Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Imam Ahmad]Day of Hastening:If you wish to stay only two days, then on the 12th of Dhul-Hijjah, known as \"Yawm al-Isti’jaal\" - the Day of Hastening – you must stone and leave Mina before sunset. If you delay your departure and are still there after sunset, you must stay an additional day. It is advisable to stay the third night if you have no urgent matter to attend to.Tawaf al-Wida:When you intend to return home after completing the Hajj rituals, perform Tawaf al-Wida (farewell circumambulation) by circling the Kaaba seven times, as done in the initial Tawaf, but this time without performing Sa’ay between Safa and Marwah.Dear readers,This religion is not from God, and nowhere in the Torah, the Gospel, or the Psalms does God command the Israelites to throw stones at Satan. That is why I always say that Allah cannot be the God of Adam, Moses, Abraham, etc. Allah's characteristics are entirely different from the God of the Bible.How can someone in their right mind pick up stones and start throwing them at Satan? Clearly, those who stone Satan are misguided.MORE OF ISLAMIC RITUALS:After completing Tawaf al-Ifadah, return to Mina and stay there for the nights of the 11th, 12th, and 13th for those not in a hurry. These are called the days of Tashreeq. It is sufficient to stay for the nights of the 11th and 12th. On these two or three days, stone all three Jamaraat in the following order: start with the one furthest from Mecca (small Jamaraat), then the middle one, and finally the big one (Jamrat al-Aqabah). Throw seven stones at each while saying \"Allahu Akbar\" with each throw. This is done for three remaining days.I urge all Christians worldwide to pray for these Muslims who travel by air to Mecca to stone Satan. They are blind and deaf, needing the love of Jesus.QUESTIONS FOR MUSLIMS:What benefit does stoning Satan provide?Where do we read that Abraham stoned Satan?Why is this practice of stoning Satan only found in the Quran?I invite you to Jesus, the Great God.Dr. Max Shimba for Max Shimba Ministries Org",

This misconception must be addressed early to enable meaningful discussions.The aim of this work is to demonstrate that the allegations against the Holy Bible by Muslims are not only false but also unfounded when viewed in light of what the Qur’an itself teaches about the Bible. By using the Qur’an – Islam’s own sacred text – we will prove the Bible's integrity. This book is crucial for anyone seeking to share the Gospel with Muslims, as well as for Muslims who genuinely wish to understand what their sacred book says about the Bible.The Qur’an affirms that the Torah, the Psalms, and the Gospel were all revealed by Allah, thus acknowledging them as His words.The Torah in the Qur’anThe Arabic term for Torah is Taurat or Tawrat:Surah 5:44: \"Lo! We did reveal the Torah, wherein is guidance and a light.\" (Pickthall)\"Surely We revealed the Taurat in which was guidance and light.\" (Shakir)The Psalms in the Qur’anThe Arabic term for Psalms is Zabur or Zaboor:Surah 4:163: \"We have sent thee inspiration, as We sent it to Noah and the Messengers after him: we sent inspiration to Abraham, Ismail, Isaac, Jacob and the Tribes, to Jesus, Job, Jonah, Aaron, and Solomon, and to David We gave the Psalms.\" (Yusuf Ali)\"...and to Dawood (David) We gave the Zaboor (Psalms).\" (Hilali-Khan)The Gospel in the Qur’anThe Arabic term for Gospel is Injil or Injeel:Surah 3:2-4: \"Allah! There is no god but He...It is He Who sent down the Law (of Moses) and the Gospel (of Jesus) before this, as a guide to mankind.\" (Yusuf Ali)Surah 5:46: \"And We caused Jesus, son of Mary, to follow in their footsteps, confirming that which was (revealed) before him in the Torah, and We bestowed on him the Gospel wherein is guidance and a light, confirming that which was (revealed) before it in the Torah – a guidance and an admonition unto those who ward off (evil).\" (Pickthall)\"And We sent after them in their footsteps Isa, son of Marium, verifying what was before him of the Taurat and We gave him the Injeel in which was guidance and light.\" (Shakir)These Qur’anic verses explicitly recognize that the Torah, the Psalms, and the Gospel are the \"Words of Allah,\" containing \"guidance and light\" for humanity. Therefore, Allah himself testifies in the Qur’an to the guidance and light within the Torah and the Gospel. Understanding Allah’s purpose in sending the Torah and the Gospel helps us see why it is vital to maintain the integrity of these Scriptures for all eternity.",

Muhammad emphatically answers 'yes.'The core theology of Islam teaches that because Allah sent Gabriel with the Quran to Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, Muhammad and the Quran fulfill and complete the mission and purpose of Christ and the New Testament. Muhammad appears to recognize the importance of the Bible (Surah 4:47; 4:136; 4:163; 5:44-48; 5:82-83; 6:92, 154), but Christianity and the New Testament must humble themselves to Islam and the Quran, the new and superior revelation.Surah 5:15-16 illustrates Muhammad's perspective using a metaphor. In the context of Muhammad's distortion of the Christian teachings of Jesus as the Son (v. 17), and in the context of his claim that the Jews are cursed (v. 13), this passage in the Quran (representing others) states that Christians (and Jews) have been walking in darkness until Muhammad came:5:15 O People of the Book [Jews and Christians] . . . there has come to you now a light from God, and a clear Book [the Quran], 16 by which God guides those who follow what pleases Him to the ways of peace, bringing them out of darkness into light, by His will, and guiding them to a straight path. (Haleem) (compare with 4:157).A modern Christian knowledgeable of the Bible will immediately recognize the metaphor of light. Jesus says He was sent from heaven as the light of the world, and Christians have passed from darkness into light (John 1:4-5, 8:12, 9:5, 12:46; 1 Peter 2:9). But now, Muhammad claims that Christians have been living in darkness, and he has come to clarify things for them, as if they were confused. The Quran offers guidance on the \"straight path,\" a theme repeatedly emphasized in Islamic scriptures (e.g., Surah 1) and \"clarifies things.\" Verse 16 is one of the verses that a Muslim might consider when showing that Islam is a religion of peace. But is it true?A committed Christian, knowledgeable of the Bible, cannot possibly believe that Islam is superior. How can we resolve this stalemate? Should we ignore it? Considering recent events such as the terrorist attacks in the United States (September 11, 9/11), this is no longer possible. Should we pretend that all religions are equal? But this forces us to deny some of the non-negotiable core doctrines that all religions have, which cannot be reconciled. Thus, should we only debate theoretical teachings?Discussing theoretical matters like the Trinity has its place in conversations between Muslims and Christians, but no side can claim to be proven through mere observation. The Quran everywhere affirms the Oneness of God, while the New Testament firmly asserts that Jesus is God and the Holy Spirit is a person. Thus, we are left with one holy scripture against another, and to break this endless stalemate, we must use other methods. (For more reliable information on the New Testament, visit this site; for the inherent problems of the Quran, go here).Since Muhammad opposes Christ and Christianity as true, we Christians must respond. What would Jesus say? As it happens, Jesus has given us clear teachings on how to evaluate a prophet who comes after Him in history, especially if that prophet claims to be greater than Jesus: evaluate their fruits.In the context of the Sermon on the Mount, Christ spoke to the crowds, none of whom were theologians, or very few, but rather lower-class farmers. In Matthew 7:15-20, Christ uses unambiguous language about how to recognize the truth of prophets:7:15 Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves. 16 You will know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes from thorn bushes or figs from thistles? 17 Even so, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. 18 A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit. 19 Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. 20 Therefore by their fruits you will know them.In today’s Western world, where millions of people prefer not to challenge Islam but rather accommodate it, this passage might seem intolerant. But in these verses, Christ understands the danger. Claims of religious truths have come into the world in large numbers, almost every second, and these claims are not merely theoretical; people's lives are at stake. Therefore, the cost of accommodation, especially since 9/11, is too high.Nevertheless, it is Muhammad who claims to be greater than Christ and that his new religion is superior to Christianity. He is the one who initiated the confrontation. Thus, over 600 years before Muhammad's arrival, Christ responded to him and many other self-proclaimed prophets spreading around the Mediterranean with the fruit inspection test.To illustrate, suppose I claim that my way is better than yours. Then I can prove my verbal claims with visible actions. My conduct will be better than yours because my actions speak louder than words. Specifically, if the founder of a religion says that husbands in my community are allowed to beat their wives (Surah 4:34), but you as a founder say that husbands in your community are not allowed to beat their wives, does my claimed superiority stand in real life? I set a bad example in practice, but you do not.What I do is not spreading the fruit of inspection. That is, my fruit or behavior or actual actions are rotten. Thus, Jesus is absolutely right to use this simple analogy for His followers to examine the claims of prophets coming after Him. \"You will know them by their fruits\" (Matt 7:16).We can see the crux of Muhammad’s objection and Christ’s fruit inspection by using a simple logical if-then (cause/effect) argument. This method is known as \"modus tollens\" or denying the consequent (part of the \"then\" clause).(1) If A, then B. If Islam has improved to become better than Christianity, these changes would be seen in practical, observable, and relevant ways.(2) Not-B. But these changes are not seen in practical, observable, and relevant ways.(3) Therefore, not-A. Therefore, Islam has not improved to become better than Christianity.Now we can defend each statement easily.(1) If Islam has improved to become better than Christianity, these changes would be seen in practical, observable, and relevant ways.We have already defended this statement in the preceding section. Examining the lives and actions of the founder of Christianity and the founder of Islam is the first and best way to break the endless stalemate between these two conflicting religions because we can see their behaviors and actions here on earth. You will know them by their fruits.(2) But these changes are not seen in practical, observable, and relevant ways.Defending this statement with tangible evidence clearly addresses Muhammad’s objection to Christ and demonstrates beyond doubt that Muhammad's fruit is bad, while Christ's fruit is healthy and ripe.The following list has already been developed in this article on this site, which is the basis of this article. If the reader believes that the actual actions of Muhammad and the following Quranic verses have been taken out of context or in a non-visible state, then, once again, they should visit other websites provided in the relevant references. These ethically questionable actions happened entirely within Muhammad's community, and Muhammad, in his Quran, commands this cruelty. Also, to see Quranic verses in multiple translations, the reader should go here and type in the references, like 24:2 (24 is the Surah, and 2 is the verse). Ignore the request for Arabic Surah titles quoted differently, and type the numbers only.Muhammad gives nicknames to his weapons and calls himself \"the destroyer.\"Christ never owned weapons because he never fought wars with people.Muhammad in his Quran commands that adulterers be flogged a hundred lashes (Surah 24:2). Authentic Hadiths (words and deeds of Muhammad outside the Quran) command stoning.Christ forgave the woman caught in adultery. The people who gathered to stone her dropped their stones and left. She remained, weeping until Jesus told her to go and sin no more (John 8:1-11).Muhammad in his Quran allowed men to beat their wives (Surah 4:34).Neither Christ nor the New Testament writers permitted or practiced this.Muhammad in his Quran commands that a thief's hand, male or female, be cut off (Surah 5:38).Christ never said to do this. The Apostle Paul said that thieves should work with their hands, not cut them off, so they can have something to share with others in need (Ephesians 4:28). In this matter (and many others), Paul surpasses Muhammad.Muhammad killed poets and political enemies.Christ never killed any of his enemies or even poets (even bad ones).Muhammad in his Quran commands the death penalty or the cutting off of hands and feet for those who wage war or cause disorder in the land (Surah 5:33).Christ, the Prince of Peace, died for the sins of the world so that \"disorder\" and \"war\" would end.Muhammad married Aisha, a girl who had not yet reached puberty, and consummated the marriage with her while she was still a young girl. For full evidence on this peculiar family affair of Muhammad, even for seventh-century Arabia, readers should see this article. The Quran itself permits such illegal marriages for other Muslims as well (Surah 65:4).Christ never did this and never told people to do so.Muhammad in his Quran promises a lush garden filled with \"virgins\" for martyrs who lose their lives in holy wars (Surah 44:51-56, 52:17-29, 55:46-78, 61:10, 4:74, 9:111).Christ's martyrdom on the cross means that Christians are not required to die in holy wars to secure entry into heaven. All they need to do is believe in Jesus.Muhammad killed without justice around 600 Jewish men and enslaved their women and children. This atrocity is celebrated in the Quran (Surah 33:25-27).Christ was a Jew and loved his people. Moreover, he loves all people of the world—even polytheists whom Muhammad killed—and redeems them through his death, burial, and resurrection. He was not sent to kill people.Muhammad launched his religious crusade in 630 CE with 30,000 fighters against the Byzantines, who did not show up (Surah 9:29).Christ never did this. What medieval Europeans did in his name is not the foundation of Christianity. Only Jesus and the New Testament are the foundation, and they did not authorize holy wars. Muhammad, on the other hand, is the foundation of Islam and initiated holy wars against Byzantine Christians and went on many holy wars.Surah 5:16, quoted in the introduction of this article, emphasizes strongly that Islam is a religion of peace. This list, however, contradicts these emphatic words directly. Actions speak louder than words. Therefore, Islam is not a religion of peace, see this site.Again, if the reader believes that these claims are taken out of context, they can click on the above site and then on the other sites provided in each claim.Christians will recognize prophets by their fruits. To put it plainly, Muhammad, the self-proclaimed messenger and prophet (Surah 3:144), has utterly failed the fruit inspection test, while Christ, the Son of God (Matt. 3:16-17), has succeeded with complete victory.(3) Therefore, Islam has not improved to become better than Christianity.This conclusion follows directly and logically.For unbiased people willing to listen to reason, issues of practical matters like wife-beating, flogging adulterers, and marrying prepubescent girls are sufficient to make a decision. Practical actions and policies cannot be ignored unless people choose to close their eyes and refuse to see how things are wrong or perhaps if a prophet has a large army to help enforce his actions on the \"weak\" followers of the \"imperfect\" preceding religion.And this brings us back to theoretical teachings, again using myself and the reader as an example. Before debating theoretical teachings like the nature of God, as a follower of a religion, I must pass the fruit inspection test. Suppose my habit is to kill polytheists in wars involving significant loss of life, instead of converting them through preaching or letting them live if they refuse to convert (Surah 9:4-5). On the other hand, it is not your habit to kill polytheists, but to convert them through preaching and letting them live if they refuse to convert. In these circumstances, I fail the real and visible fruit inspection test, but you succeed. Therefore, I lose my credibility to speak on other theoretical matters about the nature of God and other theoretical teachings that are not visible. It becomes evident that I either serve myself or, worse, serve a weak god. You, on the other hand, have sound practical ideas, so you deserve to be listened to.Similarly, Muhammad's failure in his challenge to Christ can be explained with another if-then argument, this time on the logical principle called modus ponens or affirming the antecedent (the \"if\" clause in the first statement).(4) If A, then B. If Islam has not improved to become better than Christianity in practical, visible, and relevant ways, then it logically follows that it has not improved to become better than Christianity in theoretical matters that are only conceptual.(5) A has been affirmed. Islam has not improved to become better than Christianity in practical, visible, and relevant ways.(6) Therefore, B is affirmed. Islam has not improved to become better than Christianity in theoretical matters that are only conceptual.Both statements can be defended easily.(4) If Islam has not improved to become better than Christianity in practical, visible, and relevant ways, then it logically follows that it has not improved to become better than Christianity in theoretical matters that are only conceptual.Muhammad is the exemplar of Islam since he was the conduit through which Allah revealed the superior religion, so we use him again to assess Islam. Fruit inspection says that if a prophet fails to produce it, then his conceptual claims are suspect. In a non-religious context, this standard is too high because all humans have flaws. A physicist is allowed to discuss theoretical concepts about space and time even if his life is mixed up or even full of sin. But in a religious context, especially when one religious leader (Muhammad) claims to be greater than another leader (Christ), this standard is critical and unavoidable.Furthermore, historical facts confirm Muhammad's failure in conceptual ideas. For example, it is an established fact that the New Testament is reliable, while the Quran has its share of flaws. (For more information on this topic, see these pages here and here). Also, it is a proven fact that Muhammad was not well-versed in higher concepts. What he did was take a mix of ideas circulating on trade routes and incorporate them into his Quran (such as the illogical idea denying Christ's crucifixion in Surah 4:157) and claim them as divine revelation from Allah. Thus, in clear and tangible ways, Muhammad was not improving Christianity (and Judaism) but distorting the two preceding religions. Therefore, historical facts confirm that he may not be accurate in conceptual teachings and does not understand what he is talking about.(5) Islam has not improved to become better than Christianity in practical, visible, and relevant ways.After reading the list in the second point, any fair-minded person seeking to know, who is rational and whose thoughts are not clouded by lifelong commitment to Islam, will conclude that Muhammad has failed the fruit inspection test in practical, visible, and relevant ways.(6) Therefore, it logically follows that Islam has not improved to become better than Christianity in theoretical matters that are only conceptual.These conclusions logically and clearly follow.By using the extensive list of differences between Christ and Muhammad in the second point, why would fair-minded people and those willing to listen to reason listen to Muhammad's theoretical teachings that deny the Trinity or the deity of Christ (Surah 2:116, 6:101, 4:171, 5:73) or that support the distortion of the Quran (unless he has a large army with him)? Fruit inspectors with fair minds and who are willing to listen to reason can see that his Inspired book is questionable because his life was questionable and filled with unjust actions. Indeed, fair-minded people have the right to prefer the true and gentle Book of Christ, even if it is claimed to have \"errors,\" any day and all days over Muhammad's scriptures that claim to be \"perfect\" but are excessive. First, Muhammad must show his exemplary life before being allowed to preach about high theological concepts or before his conceptual revelations are taken seriously.For ordinary Christians, especially the early followers whom Jesus taught in the Sermon on the Mount for first-century Israeli farmers, Christ says that by the fruits of a prophet, his followers will know. Once a prophet's fruit is bad, or starts producing a bad tree, they do not need to inspect his conceptual claims. This person becomes a false prophet - these are weighty words, but they are the words of Christ (Matt. 7:15).Three questions: Does this failure to pass the fruit inspection render the entire debate meaningless? If Christian and Islamic theologians in a conference room want to debate the Trinity, they are free to do so, although there are doubts about how much they can achieve. Their discussions are purely academic. However, they should not expect millions upon millions of Bible-literate Christians worldwide to feel compelled to engage in these debates. But even if they like to discuss high theology, they are free to do so. Muslims should not be surprised, however, if at the end of the day, these Christians do not accept Muhammad and his revelations as true because Christ already told his followers what to look for: good fruits (Matt. 7:15-20). Muhammad lived a controversial life preserved in his Quran, which claims to be eternal and without error, so Christians are allowed to question the Quran on conceptual matters.Is the relationship between practical and theoretical matters something that cannot contradict itself? Christ in Matt. 7:15-20 suggests that this relationship cannot contradict itself. Again, if Muhammad was wrong about practical matters like wife-beating, flogging adulterers, launching military crusades, killing poets and enemies, and promising his fighters lush gardens filled with virgins if they die in holy wars, why should Christians listen to Muhammad on theoretical matters, especially since the New Testament everywhere confirms, for example, that Christ is God and the Holy Spirit is a person? And more importantly, why would Christians want to convert to Islam, given Muhammad's questionable conduct?Is there no good fruit (virtue) related to Muhammad? Even a failure to pass the fruit inspection test can have some good qualities. The founder of a movement should show some level of gentleness if he wants his community to endure. But good qualities do not beat and hurt others. However, bad behaviors beat, hurt, and harm others. The overall picture of Muhammad's life in Medina (622-632) shows him waging wars against polytheists (capturing Mecca); against Jews (expelling and killing them); and against Christians (initiating crusades). In the ten years he lived there, he went on, sent, or initiated seventy-four attacks, raids, or full battles, ranging from peaceful negotiations (very few compared to brutal attacks) to killing raiding parties to capturing Mecca with 10,000 fighters to crusading wars with 30,000 fighters against the Byzantines (who did not show up). No one can cleanse this dark picture with a few good qualities.Therefore, Muhammad does not fulfill or complete the mission and purpose of Christ; quite the contrary, for Christ came to the world to show the love of God. Indeed, Muhammad and Islam are a distorted interpretation of Christ and Christianity, and the Quran is worse than the New Testament from an inspectable perspective.Has Islam improved to become better than Christianity? Based on observable evidence, the answer is a strong no. Muhammad has utterly failed.ShalomDr. Maxwell Shimba",

He increases in creation what He wills. Indeed, Allah is over all things competent.\" (Surah 35:1, Sahih International)The Arabic phrase for \"two, three, and four\" is similar to what is mentioned in Surah 4:3:\"But if you fear that you will not be just, then marry those that please you of [other] women, two, or three, or four. But if you fear that you will not be just, then [marry only] one or those your right hand possesses. That is more suitable that you may not incline [to injustice].\" (Surah 4:3, Sahih International)No Muslim denies that this verse limits the number of wives a man can have at one time to four, provided that he can treat them justly. Considering this, it is consistent to understand Surah 35:1 in the same way—that angels do not have more than four wings.However, by making this claim, the Quran contradicts the Holy Bible on this matter, as there are angels who indeed have six wings:\"In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and the train of his robe filled the temple. Above him stood the seraphim; each had six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. And one called to another and said: 'Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory.' And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke. And I said: 'Woe is me! For I am lost; for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts!' Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a burning coal that he had taken with tongs from the altar. And he touched my mouth and said: 'Behold, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away, and your sin atoned for.'\" (Isaiah 6:1-7, ESV)Furthermore, the so-called sound traditions also contradict the Quran on this point as the hadith states that Gabriel (Jibril) has six hundred wings!Narrated Abu Ishaq-Ash-Shaibani:I asked Zir bin Hubaish regarding the Statement of Allah: “And was at a distance of but two bow-lengths or (even) nearer; so did (Allah) convey the Inspiration to His servant (Gabriel) and then he (Gabriel) conveyed (that to Muhammad). (53:9-10) On that, Zir said, \"Ibn Mas'ud informed us that the Prophet had seen Gabriel having 600 wings.\" (Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 54, Number 455)Narrated Abdullah:Regarding the Verse: \"And he (Muhammad) certainly saw him (Gabriel) in another descent, at the Lote-tree of the utmost boundary.\" (53:13-14) Ibn Mas'ud reported that the Prophet saw Gabriel having 600 wings. (Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 6, Book 60, Number 380)Additionally:Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbas:Allah’s Messenger (ﷺ) said, “I saw Gabriel at the Lote-tree of the utmost boundary. He had six hundred wings, and between each two wings there was a distance of as far as the eye could see.” (Al-Tirmidhi)According to Aisha, this was one of the times Muhammad saw Gabriel in his true form:Narrated Masruq:I said to Aisha, \"O Mother! Did Muhammad see his Lord?\" Aisha said, \"What you have said makes my hair stand on end! Know that if somebody tells you one of the following three things, he is a liar: Whoever tells you that Muhammad saw his Lord, is a liar.\" Then Aisha recited the Verse: 'No vision can grasp Him, but His grasp is over all vision. He is Subtle, and All-Aware.' (6.103) \"It is not fitting for a human being that Allah should speak to him except by inspiration, or from behind a veil.\" (42.51) 'Aisha further said, \"And whoever tells you that the Prophet knows what is going to happen tomorrow, is a liar.\" She then recited: \"No soul can know what it will earn tomorrow.\" (31.34) She added: \"And whoever tells you that he (the Prophet) concealed (some of Allah's orders), is a liar.\" Then she recited: \"O Apostle! Proclaim (the Message) which has been sent down to you from your Lord.\" (5.67) 'Aisha added. \"But the Prophet saw Gabriel in his true form twice.\" (Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 6, Book 60, Number 378)Narrated Aisha:Whoever claimed that (the Prophet) Muhammad saw his Lord is committing a grave error, for he only saw Gabriel in his actual form in which he was created, covering the whole horizon. (Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 54, Number 457)Narrated Masruq:I asked Aisha \"What about His Statement: ‘Then he (Gabriel) approached and came closer, and was at a distance of two bow lengths or (even) nearer.' (53:8-9)\" She replied, \"It was Gabriel who used to come to the Prophet in the form of a man, but on this occasion, he came in his actual form and covered the whole horizon.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 54, Number 458)Finally:Al-Tirmidhi reported:Ibn ‘Abbas met Ka‘b [al-Ahbar] at ‘Arafa and asked him about a certain matter. Ka‘b began to proclaim Allahu Akbar! Until the mountains echoed back. Ibn ‘Abbas said: “We are Banu Hashim!” Ka‘b said: “Allah divided His vision and speech between Muhammad and Musa. Musa spoke with Him twice, and Muhammad saw Him twice.” Masruq said: “Later I went to ‘Aisha and asked her: ‘Did Muhammad see his Lord?’ She replied: ‘You have said something that makes my hair stand on end.’ I said: ‘Calm down!’ She recited the verses: 'No vision can grasp Him.' (6:103) 'It is not for a human being that Allah should speak to him except by inspiration or from behind a veil.' (42:51) Then she said: “But he saw Gabriel in his true form only twice: once at the Lote-tree of the utmost boundary and once at Jiyad in Mecca, with six hundred wings, filling the horizon.” (Islamic Teachings and Beliefs: Volume 1: Prophets in Barzakh, Hadith on Isra’ and Mir’aj, the Immense Merits of Al-Sham, the Vision of Allah, Al-Sayyid Muhammad Ibn 'Alawi al-Maliki, translated and annotated by Dr. Gibril Fouad Haddad, As-Sunna Foundation of America 1999, p.147-148)Now, some attempt to resolve this by claiming that the text of Surah 35:1 does not mean that angels have two, three, or four wings, but rather that Allah sends groups of angels in pairs, threes, or fours. In other words, this passage refers to the number of angels sent together. This interpretation, if correct, contradicts the following verses:\"When you said to the believers, 'Is it not enough for you that your Lord should reinforce you with three thousand angels sent down?' Yes, if you remain patient and conscious of Allah and the enemy come upon you in rage, your Lord will reinforce you with five thousand angels having marks [of distinction].\" (Surah 3:124-125, Sahih International)\"[Remember] when you asked help of your Lord, and He answered you, 'Indeed, I will reinforce you with a thousand from the angels, following one another.'\" (Surah 8:9, Sahih International)We are not aware of any passage in the Quran that speaks of an event where Allah sent angels in pairs, threes, or fours. The number is usually not specified. The only time we read about two angels together is in the story of Harut and Marut. On the other hand, the above verses mention numbers that are far greater.Others might try to argue that the last part of the verse clarifies the meaning of the text:\"All praise is due to Allah, Creator of the heavens and the earth, [who] made the angels messengers having wings, two, three, and four, and increases in creation what He wills. Indeed, Allah is over all things competent.\" (Khalifa)It has been suggested that the final part indicates that Allah can add to the creation of the angels as He wills.The problem with this claim is that it presupposes that the phrase indeed pertains to the previous description about the angels, as opposed to simply saying that Allah can increase His creation as He sees fit, since the text mentions Allah as the Creator of the heavens and the earth. Considering this, one might assume that Allah increases His creation not by adding wings to the angels but rather in relation to the increase of humans, animals, plants, the formation of stars, and so on. This interpretation makes complete sense in light of what immediately follows:\"O mankind, remember the favor of Allah upon you. Is there any creator other than Allah who provides for you from the heaven and the earth? There is no deity except Him, so how are you deluded? ... Allah is He who sends the winds and they stir the clouds and spread them in the sky however He wills, and He makes them fragments, so you see the rain emerge from within them. And when He causes it to fall upon whom He wills of His servants, immediately they rejoice.\" (Surah 35:3, 9-13, Sahih International)Do you not see that Allah sends down rain from the sky? He brings forth fruits of various colors with it. In the mountains, there are streaks of white and red, of varying shades, and some are raven black. Among people and moving creatures and grazing livestock are various colors as well. Only those who fear Allah among His servants have knowledge. Indeed, Allah is Exalted in Might and Forgiving. (Surah 35:27-28, Sahih International)After all, there is a difference between creation and a creature. The phrase does not say: He adds to His creature/creatures what He wills, i.e., putting more wings on them after their creation, but it means that He can add more/different creatures to His creation as He wills.Furthermore, this interpretation overlooks the fact that the same construction is found in Surah 4:3 where no one disputes that the plain meaning of the verse is that the maximum number of wives a man can have is four. Since the same construction is used in Surah 35:1, it becomes very difficult to escape the conclusion that this reference clearly states that four wings are the maximum a single angel can have. That is unless, of course, a Muslim wants to be consistent and claim that none of these texts imply that four is the maximum number, thus suggesting that a man can have more than four wives at one time!Moreover, even if we were to assume for the sake of argument that the last part of the sentence refers to Allah adding extra wings for the angels, this still wouldn't prove the Muslim case. It would only mean that Allah can increase the wings of the angels but not beyond four, i.e., He can make an angel with two wings have three, another with three wings have four, but no more than that since He has designed it such that the most wings an angel can have at one time is four.Besides, it seems that the real reason why Muslims came up with this answer is because they clearly saw the conflict between this verse in the Quran and the hadith. It is very doubtful that anyone would have connected the last part of the sentence about Allah adding to His creation with Allah adding more wings to the angels if the hadith did not mention that Gabriel had six hundred wings.It seems more likely that if there were no traditions about Gabriel having that many wings, Muslims would have no problem admitting that the maximum number of wings an angel can have is four. This is especially so since the Arabic construction is identical to that found in Surah 4:3, which clearly limits the maximum number of wives a man can have to four.We accept that this Muslim answer is purely ad hoc, an argument supported by the opinion of the renowned Sunni scholar Ibn Kathir who wrote the following regarding Surah 35:1:\"<two, three, or four.> means, among them are those who have two wings, those who have three and those who have four. Some have more than that, as mentioned in the Hadith that states that the Messenger of Allah saw Jibril (peace be upon him) on the Night of the Isra with six hundred wings. Between each pair of wings, there was a distance like that between the east and the west. Allah says...<He increases in creation what He wills. Indeed, Allah is over all things competent.> As-Suddi said, 'He adds wings to them and creates them as He wills.'\"(Source; emphasis ours)Notice that Ibn Kathir says that some angels have more than four wings based on the hadith, not because of the text itself. This highlights the truly ad hoc nature of the Muslim argument.More importantly, if Muslims still insist that their interpretation of Surah 35:1 is correct, then they exacerbate the problem. After all, the claim that Muhammad saw the true form of Gabriel directly contradicts the Quran, which clearly states that humans cannot see the true form of angels, which is why they take on human forms!\"And they say, 'Why has an angel not been sent down to him?' But if We had sent down an angel, the matter would have been decided; then they would not be reprieved. And if We had made him an angel, We would have made him [appear as] a man, and We would have covered them with that in which they cover themselves.\" (Surah 6:8-9, Sahih International)The two Jalals explained why angels must take human forms:\"And had We appointed him an angel, We would assuredly have made him (as) a man, that is, We would have sent him in the form of a man, so that they would be able to see him, for no human being is capable of seeing an angel and surviving; and We would have confused them when they are [now] confused.\" (Tafsir al-Jalalayn; source; bold and underline emphasis ours)Ibn Kathir writes:\"And if We had made him an angel, We would have certainly made him [appear as] a man. And We would have confounded them in what they confuse themselves.\"Meaning, if We had sent an angel along with the human Messenger, or if We had sent an angel as a Messenger to mankind, he would have appeared in human form so that they could speak to him and benefit from his teachings. In this case, the angel (in human form) would have brought them the same confusion that they brought upon themselves! Allah said...\"Say: 'If there were angels walking about on the earth, We would surely have sent down to them from the heaven an angel as a Messenger.'\" (17:95)It is a mercy from Allah to His creatures that He sends messengers from among themselves so they can talk to them and benefit from their teachings. In another Ayah, Allah said...\"Indeed, Allah conferred a great favor upon the believers when He sent among them a Messenger from among themselves, reciting to them His verses and purifying them.\" (3:164)Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn Abbas said about Ayah [6:9 above]: \"If an angel were sent to them, he would have come in the shape of a man because they would not be able to look at the angel because of the light.\" (Tafsir Ibn Kathir (Abridged) (Surat An-Nisa, Ayah 148 to the end of Surat Al-An’am), abridged by a group of scholars under the supervision of Shaykh Safiur-Rahman Al-Mubarakpuri [Darussalam Publishers & Distributors, Riyadh, Houston, New York, Lahore, First Edition: January 2000], Parts 6, 7 & 8, Volume 3, p. 317-318; bold and underline emphasis ours)Regarding this Surah, the late Muhammad Asad said:\"8 That is, 'We would have confused them about what they are now confounded.' Since it is impossible for mortal man to see angels as they really are, the hypothetical angelic bringer of a message would have had to assume the shape of a human being—and thus, the very demand for a direct 'angelic' revelation would have remained unsatisfied, and their confusion would have persisted.\" (Source; bold emphasis ours)He reiterates this point in his commentary on Surah 19:17, which mentions the Spirit of God appearing to Mary as a man:\"14 As pointed out in surah 2, note 71, and surah 16, note 2, the term ruh is often used in the Qur’an to describe God’s guidance. Occasionally, however, it is used to describe the medium through which such guidance is imparted to God’s elect—namely, an angel. Since— as stated in 6:9—mortal man cannot see angels as they really are, God caused them to appear to Mary 'in the shape of a well-made human being', i.e., in a form accessible to her perception. According to Razi, the designation of an angel as ruh ('soul' or 'spirit') indicates that this category of beings is purely spiritual, without any physical element.\" (Source; bold emphasis ours)This, perhaps, explains why the Quran mentions angels appearing to prophets in human forms as follows:\"And when Our messengers came to Lot, he was anguished for them and felt for them great discomfort and said, 'This is a trying day.' And his people came hastening to him, and before [this] they had been doing evil deeds. He said, 'O my people, these are my daughters; they are purer for you [if you marry them]. So fear Allah and do not disgrace me concerning my guests. Is there not among you a man of reason?' They said, 'You have already known that we have not concerning your daughters any claim, and indeed, you know what we want.' He said, 'If only I had against you some power or could take refuge in a strong support.' The angels said, 'O Lot, indeed we are messengers of your Lord; [therefore] they will never reach you. So set out with your family during a portion of the night and let not any among you look back—except your wife; indeed, she will be struck by that which strikes them. Indeed, their appointment is [for] the morning. Is not the morning near?' So when Our command came, We made the highest part [of the city] its lowest and rained upon them stones of layered hard clay, [which were] marked from your Lord. And Allah’s punishment is not from the wrongdoers [very] far.\" (Surah 11:77-83, Sahih International)But if no human can see an angel except in human form, then this means Muhammad could not have seen the true form of Gabriel. But if he did not see the true form of Gabriel, then all those traditions that claim he did must be mistaken! Thus, no matter how one tries to reconcile these contradictory claims, there will always be problems between what the Quran and the Hadith say.Shalom,Dr. Max Shimba for Max Shimba Ministries",

Its direction is where the sun rises in the morning.The name \"East\" comes from the Arabic wordمشرق(mashriq), which means \"the place where the sun rises.\"East is usually on the right side of a map.What is the West?West is one of the four cardinal directions. Its direction is where the sun sets.West is also the name of the evening prayer time for Muslims.The name \"West\" comes from the Arabic wordمَغْرِب(maghrib), which means \"the place where the sun sets.\"West is usually on the left side of a map.What is a Compass?A compass is a device used to determine direction. It is essential for navigation at sea or on land without visible landmarks like in a desert.A compass has four main directions: North, East, South, and West.Intermediate directions are mentioned as northeast/northwest and southeast/southwest (in English, Northeast NE/Northwest NW and Southeast SE/Southwest SW).It is possible to mention more precise directions, for example, south-southwest (SSW) or west-southwest (WSW).Surah Al-Ma'arij, Ayah 40: \"But no! I swear by the Lord of all points in the East and the West that We are certainly able.\"Here, Muhammad, who is the speaker of the Quran, contradicts his initial claim that there are two Easts and two Wests inSurah Ar-Rahman, Ayah 17.Besides these four directions, there are other directions.Observe the following compass, directions a - h are pronounced as follows:NorthNorth-northeastNortheastEast-northeastEastEast-southeastSoutheastSouth-southeastSouthSouth-southwestSouthwestWest-southwestWestWest-northwestNorthwestNorth-northwestTo remember easily, imagine you are saying, \"North of northeast, north of northeast, etc.\"The sun rises in the East and sets in the West.When the sun rises, we say it has dawned or it is sunrise.It is good to understand the relationship between the sun's direction, time, and the direction of the shadow. For example:In the morning, the sun is in the East. The shadow is in the West.In the afternoon, the sun is in the West. The shadow is in the East.When the sun sets, it is called sunset or dusk or West.North is the top of the compass. The compass starts from the North.Another name for North is Shimali or Shemali, and Matlahi is another name for East.The sun is opposite to the shadow, meaning if the sun is in the South, the shadow will be in the North.Exercise Aa) One morning as I was heading to school, my shadow was in front of me.In which direction was the school? __________In which direction was my home? _______b) One evening as I was coming back from grazing, my shadow was on my right side. In which direction was I heading?c) Juma lives southeast of Fatuma. In which direction does Fatuma live from Juma?d) In which direction does the sun set?Exercise Ba) What is the direction found between South and West?b) What is the direction found between West and East?c) What is the direction found between North-northeast and North?d) What is the direction found between South-southwest and West?e) What is the direction found between North and East?THAT'S WHY I CONTINUE TO SAY ALLAH IS NOT GOD.Shalom,Dr. Max Shimba, a servant of Jesus Christ, the Mighty God(Titus 2:13)",

    "full_content": "na Dr. Maxwell ShimbaMoja ya maswali yanayoulizwa sana kuhusu Biblia ni \"Kaini alipata wapi mke wake?\" Wanaoshuku wamegundua kuwa Wakristo wengi wanashindwa kujibu swali hili, lakini jibu si gumu kama unavyoweza kufikiria.Miaka michache iliyopita, nilinunua Biblia ya Watoto ya Dhahabu ili kutumia na binti yangu mdogo Elizabeth wakati wa wakati wa ibada. Ilichapishwa awali mwaka 1965, na nilivutiwa na vielelezo vya kweli vilivyokumbusha vile nilivyokuwa naviona katika shule ya Jumapili. Biblia hiyo haikuwa tafsiri maalum bali ilikuwa ni paraphrase ya matukio teule kutoka kwa Maandiko. Nilipofika kwenye sehemu iliyoitwa, “Kaini na Abeli, Wana wa Adamu,” niliisoma,Baada ya hayo [wakati Mungu alipomwekea Kaini alama], Kaini akaenda kutoka mbele za Bwana, na akaishi katika nchi ya Nodi, upande wa mashariki wa Edeni.Na baadaye katika nchi ya Nodi, Kaini akachukua mke na akamzaa mwana ambaye aliitwa Henoki.Akaunti hii ya paraphrase ya Maandiko inaonyesha dhana potofu sana inayohusiana na wapi Kaini alipata mke wake. Wakristo wengi wamefundishwa kuwa Kaini alienda Nodi, alipata mke, akaoa, na akapata mwana. Lakini ikiwa Adamu na Eva walikuwa watu wawili tu ambao Mungu aliwaumba, watu wa Nodi walitoka wapi?Biblia Inasema Nini?Kwanza, hebu tusome maneno halisi ya Mwanzo 4:16–17, ambayo Biblia ya Watoto ya Dhahabu ilijaribu kupunguza:Kisha Kaini akaenda zake kutoka mbele za Bwana, akakaa katika nchi ya Nodi, mashariki mwa Edeni. Kaini akamjua mkewe, naye akapata mimba akamzaa Henoki. Alipojenga mji, aliuita jina la mji huo kwa jina la mwanawe, Henoki.Biblia haisemi kuwa Kaini alienda Nodi na baadaye alipata mke huko. Badala yake, maelezo ya Maandiko ni kwamba tayari alikuwa na mke alipokwenda Nodi. Tukio lililofanyika Nodi ni kwamba alimjua mkewe—alikuwa na uhusiano wa ndoa naye—na alipata mimba na kuzaa mwana.Ikiwa Kaini hakuoa mtu aliyeishi katika nchi ya Nodi, bado tuna swali, \"Kaini alipata wapi mke wake?\" au \"Kaini alioa nani?\" Tena, tunahitaji kuangalia Maandiko kwa jibu.Katika Mwanzo 2:7, tunasoma juu ya uumbaji wa Adamu, “Kisha Bwana Mungu akamfanya mtu kutoka mavumbi ya ardhi na akampulizia puani pumzi ya uhai, na mtu akawa nafsi hai.”Mwanzo 2:21–22 inasimulia uumbaji wa Eva, “Basi Bwana Mungu akamleta usingizi mzito Adamu, naye Adamu akalala usingizi; akachukua ubavu wake mmoja, kisha akaufunga mwili mahali pake. Na ule ubavu Bwana Mungu aliouchukua katika Adamu akaufanya mwanamke, akamleta kwa Adamu.”Na katika Mwanzo 1:28, tunasoma amri ya Mungu kwa Adamu na Eva, “Mungu akawabarikia, Mungu akawaambia, Zaeni, mkaongezeke, mkaijaze dunia na kuitiisha.”Mwanzo 5:4 inafanya wazi kuwa Adamu na Eva walikuwa na wana na binti wengi.Mungu aliwaumba watu wawili tu, Adamu na Eva, na aliwaambia wapate watoto wengi—“Ijazeni dunia!” Maandiko yanataja majina ya watoto watatu tu wa Adamu na Eva (Kaini, Abeli, na Sethi). Hata hivyo, Mwanzo 5:4 inafanya wazi kuwa walikuwa na wana na binti wengi:Siku za Adamu baada ya kumzaa Sethi zilikuwa miaka mia nane; na alikuwa na wana na binti wengine.Zaidi ya hayo, Mwanzo 3:20 inasema, Adamu akamwita mkewe jina lake Eva; kwa kuwa ndiye mama wa wote walio hai.Maandiko yanaweka wazi kwamba kila mwanadamu anazaliwa kutoka kwa Adamu na Eva. Ingawa ni kawaida kuainisha watu katika “rangi” kulingana na rangi ya ngozi, umbo la macho, na kadhalika, kwa kweli kuna jamii moja tu.Kwa hivyo, kwa kuwa sisi ni \"damu moja\" inayotokana na Adamu na Eva, mtu pekee ambaye Kaini angeweza kuoa angekuwa dada au mpwa wake.Ni kweli kwamba jamii ya wanadamu sasa inajumuisha makundi mengi ya watu. Hii ilikuwaje? Historia ya baadaye katika Mwanzo inatusaidia kuelewa kwa nini watu sasa wanaonekana tofauti sana kutoka kwa kila mmoja, ingawa wote walitoka kwa watu wawili tu.Uzao wa Adamu na Eva uliongezeka na kuijaza dunia kwa takriban miaka 1,500 kabla ya gharika ya Nuhu. Wakati huo, tukio muhimu lilitokea katika vinasaba vya binadamu: idadi ya watu ilipunguzwa hadi familia ya Nuhu ya watu wanane waliokuwa kwenye safina. Baada ya gharika, jamii ya wanadamu iliongezeka tena, lakini kwa kutotii Mungu, hawakujaza dunia. Hivyo, Mungu aliwahukumu kwa kuchanganya lugha zao kwenye mnara wa Babeli, na kutoka hapo, wakahamia, wakijaza dunia, kama Mungu alivyokusudia. Watu walipojitenga katika vikundi tofauti ulimwenguni, tabia fulani za mwili zilitawala, kama vile ngozi nyeusi Afrika na macho yenye umbo la mlozi Asia.Licha ya utofauti wa sifa za mwili tunaouona leo, Biblia (na sayansi ya vinasaba) inathibitisha kwamba sisi sote ni jamii moja. Kama Matendo 17:26 inavyosema, “Naye alifanya kila taifa la wanadamu kutoka kwa mtu mmoja kuishi juu ya uso wa dunia yote, na akaweka nyakati zao na mipaka ya makao yao.”Je, Unaweza Kuoa Jamaa Yako?Majibu ya haraka kwa Kaini kuoa dada yake au mpwa wake ni mshtuko au kuchukizwa. Leo, kuoa jamaa wa karibu kunaitwa uzinzi. Hata hivyo, takriban miaka 6,000 iliyopita, Mungu hakukataza ndoa kati ya jamaa wa karibu. Kwa nini?Adamu na Eva waliumbwa wakamilifu. Haikuwa mpaka baada ya kuanguka kwamba mateso na kifo vilivyoathiri wanadamu na kila kiumbe hai kingine. Jambo moja la mateso haya lingekuwa mabadiliko katika DNA yanayosababisha magonjwa. Kwa kuwa Adamu na Eva waliumbwa wakamilifu kijenetiki, watoto wao wangekuwa na mabadiliko machache. Mabadiliko katika vizazi vinavyofuata yangeendelea kuongezeka na kujilimbikiza. Hatimaye, ikawa hatari sana kuoa jamaa wa karibu kwa sababu ya uwezekano mkubwa wa ugonjwa wa kurithi.Wakati wa Musa, takriban miaka 2,500 baada ya uumbaji, Mungu alipiga marufuku ndoa kati ya jamaa wa karibu (Mambo ya Walawi 18:6–18). Inaonekana kwamba sababu moja ilikuwa ni afya. Ingawa Waisraeli hawakujua chochote kuhusu DNA, Mungu alijua, na alijua jamaa wa karibu walikuwa na uwezekano wa kuwa na mabadiliko sawa. Kwa kuwa magonjwa mengi hutokea tu wakati mtoto anapokuwa na nakala mbili za mabadiliko sawa (moja kutoka kwa mama na moja kutoka kwa baba), ndoa kati ya jamaa wa karibu ingeathiri Waisraeli. Hii ni moja ya sababu ndoa kama hizo zimepigwa marufuku leo—kuzuia magonjwa yanayoweza kuwapata watoto wa aina hii ya ndoa.Jinsi Jibu la Swali Hili Linavyoathiri Injili?Mara nyingi nimesikia Wakristo wakisema kwamba haijalishi kama Mwanzo unatoa historia ya kweli, kama ndoa ya Kaini. Uumbaji ni suala la pembeni, sio fundisho kuu, na jambo muhimu zaidi ni “kumtumaini Yesu.” Ingawa nakubaliana kabisa kwamba injili ndiyo ujumbe wetu mkuu, watu lazima waitegemee Biblia ili kujua injili ni nini. Ikiwa Biblia inayohusisha injili si sahihi na ya kweli katika Mwanzo, basi tunajuaje kama inasema ukweli kuhusu Yesu Kristo?Zaidi ya hayo, historia ya uzao wa Adamu katika Mwanzo ni msingi wa kuelewa jinsi injili inavyotumika kwa watu wote. Kwa sababu watu wote ni wazao wa Adamu na Eva, watu wote ni wenye dhambi (Warumi 3:23, 5:12). Kristo alikufa na kufufuka ili kuwakomboa uzao wa Adamu (Warumi 5:15, 17; 1 Wakorintho 15:21–22, 45). Ikiwa Kaini alioa mtu mwingine zaidi ya uzao wa Adamu na Eva, hiyo ingepingana na mafundisho ya wazi ya Maandiko, sio tu katika Mwanzo bali pia jinsi yanavyohusiana na injili. Ikiwa kuna jamii zingine, basi injili haiwezi kuwa kwa watu wote (1 Timotheo 2:4). Haiwezi—injili inategemea kwa sehemu jibu sahihi la kibiblia kuhusu wapi Kaini alipata mke wake. Kwa hivyo, si suala la pembeni tu, ni sehemu ya suala kuu!Petro anatunasihi tuwe tayari kila mara kutoa jibu kwa tumaini tulilo nalo (1 Petro 3:15). Historia katika Mwanzo, ikijumuisha utambulisho wa mke wa Kaini, ni muhimu kwa kuelewa kwamba sisi sote ni wenye dhambi na tunahitaji msamaha na wokovu unaotolewa kupitia Yesu Kristo.Dr. Maxwell Shimba ni rais wa Taasisi ya Theolojia ya Shimba",

In the Arabic Bible, the name is يوحنا (Yuhanna) and not Yahya, the fake name given by Muslims. You can verify this here:Arabic BibleTo test this truth, today I ask Muslims a simple question:Matthew 21:25\"The baptism of John, where was it from? From heaven or from men?\" They reasoned among themselves, saying, \"If we say, 'From heaven,' He will say to us, 'Why then did you not believe him?'\"QUESTION:Where did the baptism of John come from?I would like Muslims to answer me with verses and not just their own words.If the baptism of \"Yahya\" came from the Great God, why aren’t you Muslims baptized?If it came from men, why isn’t there a verse in the Quran that rejects the baptism of \"John\"?If it came from men, why was Jesus baptized?If there is no verse in the Quran that talks about baptism, then \"Yahya\" is not the same as \"يوحنا (Yuhanna)\" John in the Bible, and the Yahya in the Quran is fake and was fabricated by Muhammad.The Bible says, “Or do you not know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death? We were therefore buried with Him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.” (Romans 6:3-4).In Christian baptism, the act of being immersed in water symbolizes being buried with Christ. The act of coming out of the water symbolizes being resurrected with Christ.Shalom,Max Shimba, servant of Jesus Christ, the Great God and our Savior.Titus 2:13",

And Allah spoke to Moses directly.\"This means that Muhammad knew very little about the Prophets, i.e., only about 0.0002% of them. This is also the understanding of all Muslims regarding Prophets. However, Allah S.W directed Muhammad on where to get more light by saying:[YUNUS – 94]\"So if you are in doubt, [O Muhammad], about that which We have revealed to you, then ask those who have been reading the Scripture before you. The truth has certainly come to you from your Lord, so never be among the doubters.\"So, concerning the Prophets, almost all the Prophets narrated to Muhammad are found in the Bible. As we saw in the first part of our topic today, we inform Muslims about Paul’s prophethood.If you read the Quran carefully, you will find that the story of Paul is well described.Examine this verse:[YA-SIN – 13-14]\"And present to them an example: the people of the city, when the messengers came to it—When We sent to them two but they denied them, so We strengthened them with a third, and they said, 'Indeed, we are messengers to you.'\"This verse tells the story of Allah's messengers. Commentators and scholars like Sheikh Balwani and Yusuf Ali have interpreted this verse and said that the city to which the messengers were sent is Antioch.Ibn Kathir, in his commentary, states that the messengers were John, Simon, and Paul.Here, I quote Ibn Kathir:\"It is narrated by Ibn Jurayj from Wahb bin Sulayman, transmitted by Shu’ayb Al-Jaba’i, 'The names of the first two messengers sent were Simon and John, and the name of the third was Paul. The city was Antioch.' They said (to the people of the city), 'Indeed, we are sent to you as messengers,' meaning 'Messengers from Allah who created you and commands you to worship Him alone and not associate any partners with Him.' Qatada said they were messengers of Jesus, son of Mary (a.s), sent to the people of Antioch. They said, 'You are but human beings like us... How can you receive revelation when you are human like us? Why do we not receive revelation like you?' This was the attitude of the people of other nations who said, 'We do not believe,' as Allah tells us in Surah 64:6: 'That was because their messengers used to come to them with clear proofs, but they said, \"Shall mere men guide us!\" So they disbelieved and turned away. And Allah was in no need of them.'\"Thus, we see that the argument against Paul is a recent invention. Muslims, scholars, and early ulama did not have this argument against Paul.2. PAUL'S PROPHETHOOD ACCORDING TO THE HADITHAfter seeing the evidence from the Holy Scriptures about the prophethood of Paul, let’s turn to the hadiths of Prophet Muhammad. Why should we turn to hadith? Because of the advice given by Allah S.W within the Quran itself:[AN-NISAAI – 59]\"O you who have believed, obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you. And if you disagree over anything, refer it to Allah and the Messenger, if you should believe in Allah and the Last Day. That is the best [way] and best in result.\"In a book called SIRAT NABAWIYA, written by Ibn Hisham, a student of Ibn Ishak, in the fourth volume of that book, page 140, Muhammad lists the names of the disciples of Jesus. He divides them into two groups: those who followed Jesus during His life and those who followed after He ascended. Muhammad describes each of the disciples and where they were sent; concerning Paul, he states that Paul was sent to Rome.Here, I quote Ibn Hisham:أسماء رسل عيسى عليه السلام\"Amesema ibh Is-hak: walikuwa miongoni mwa wanafunzi wa Yesu (amani iwe juu yake) wale waliomfuata wale waliokuwa baada yake duniani: Petro Mwanafunzi wa Yesu, na pamoja naye alikuwepo Paulo miongoni mwa wafuasi, Paulo hakuwa miongoni mwa wale wanafunzi wa Yesu. Naye (Paulo) alitumwa Rumi. Na Andrea naye alitumwa katika nchi ambayo wakazi wake wanakula watu. Na Tomaso alitumwa katika nchi ya Babeli katika nchi za mashariki. Na Philipo alitumwa katika nchi pande za Afrika, na Yohana alitumwa Efeso na Yakobo alitumwa Yerusalemu na Batholomeo alitumwa Uarabuni katika nchi ya Hijaz. Na Simoni alitumwa Baribari.\"Majina ya Mitume wa Yesu Masihi:“Amesema ibn Is-hak: walikuwa miongoni mwa wanafunzi wa Yesu (amani iwe juu yake) wale waliomfuata wale waliokuwa baada yake duniani: Petro Mwanafunzi wa Yesu, na pamoja naye alikuwepo Paulo miongoni mwa wafuasi, Paulo hakuwa miongoni mwa wale wanafunzi wa Yesu. Naye (Paulo) alitumwa Rumi. Na Andrea naye alitumwa katika nchi ambayo wakazi wake wanakula watu. Na Tomaso alitumwa katika nchi ya Babeli katika nchi za mashariki. Na Philipo alitumwa katika nchi pande za Afrika, na Yohana alitumwa Efeso na Yakobo alitumwa Yerusalemu na Batholomeo alitumwa Uarabuni katika nchi ya Hijaz. Na Simoni alitumwa Baribari.”It is surprising to see that despite such significant evidence, today’s Muslims (especially activists) have chosen to ignore this truth and start misleading people, either intentionally or out of ignorance. The question is: for whose benefit are they doing this?My Muslim friend, I want to warn you that Satan is cunning and will always come with deception, using false teachers. Some will come as defenders of the faith, but they are the greatest destroyers of the faith.Allah S.W says in the Quran to tell Muslims:[AL-BAQARA – 136]\"Say: We have believed in Allah and what has been revealed to us and what was revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Descendants, and what was given to Moses and Jesus, and what was given to the prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and we are Muslims [in submission] to Him.\"You see that Allah S.W has instructed Muslims not only to believe in the 25 mentioned Prophets in the Quran but also to believe in what was revealed to the descendants of Jacob. PAUL IS ALSO A DESCENDANT OF THE PROPHET JACOB. But not only that, Allah S.W has asked Muslims to believe in what was revealed to \"other prophets.\" PAUL IS ALSO AMONG THE OTHER PROPHETS.Therefore, rejecting Paul is to reject the faith, reject the Quran, and ultimately reject Allah Himself. AND THIS IS EXTREME UNBELIEF.Is there any hadith where the Prophet warned his companions or Muslims in general about Paul’s teachings?No, instead, we see Muhammad himself quoting Paul's teachings and calling it a message from Allah:“It is narrated by Abu Huraira, the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w) said; Allah said, ‘I have prepared for My righteous servants what no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and no human heart has conceived.’”Thus, we see that the argument against Paul’s prophethood has no foundation in the teachings of the Holy Scriptures and is a distortion by self-seeking religious teachers.Shalom,Max Shimba Ministries Org",

However, when we read God's books and history, there is not a single part where we read that Ishmael, whose mother was African, had any relationship with Muhammad of Islam.Let's read this evidence:Genesis 21:14-21 (KJV)14 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.15 And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.16 And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lifted up her voice, and wept.17 And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? Fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.18 Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation.19 And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.20 And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.21 And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.In Genesis 21:21, we learn that Ishmael's wife was from Africa and was not an Arab.Dear brothers and sisters, ISLAM IS A MADE-UP RELIGION.It has no foundation beyond imitating Christianity and Judaism.ISLAM CANNOT BE TAUGHT WITHOUT CHRISTIANITY. ALLAH CANNOT EXIST WITHOUT JEHOVAH. MUHAMMAD CANNOT CALL HIMSELF A PROPHET WITHOUT THE EXISTENCE OF JESUS.THE ISHMAEL OF ISLAM CANNOT BE TAUGHT WITHOUT MUSLIMS STEALING AND USING THE COMPLETE AND DOUBTLESS BIBLE.Moreover, there is no verifiable evidence that Ishmael married a Jurhumite; the Holy Bible assures us that Ishmael married a woman from Egypt, Africa.Let's read further evidence here:Genesis 25:12-18 (KJV)12 Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham:13 And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,14 And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,15 Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:16 These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.17 And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.18 And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his brethren.We read that Ishmael's children lived on the border of Egypt, not in the Arabian Peninsula or Saudi Arabia.So why do Muslims cling to Ishmael?Muslims cry over Ishmael to establish a connection to Abraham, who is the father of Isaac. Muhammad knew that if he claimed no kinship with Abraham, no one would follow his fabricated religion of Islam.ALLAH NEVER SPOKE TO ISHMAEL EVEN ONCEMUSLIMS HAVE BEEN DEFENDING ISHMAEL USING THE BIBLE!THERE IS NO VERSE WHERE ALLAH SAYS ISHMAEL IS A MUSLIM.They further confirm to us that the Quran is a book full of doubt!There is no part of the Quran that shows Allah spoke to Ishmael! Nor is there any part of that book that says Allah made him a great nation and that he would have twelve princes!THERE IS NO PART OF THE BIBLE THAT SHOWS THAT MUHAMMAD CAME FROM ISHMAEL'S LINEAGE, LET ALONE HIS NAME!SINCE THEY DEPEND ON THE BIBLE, LET THEM TELL US BETWEEN ISAAC AND ISHMAEL WHO WAS OFFERED BY ABRAHAM AS A BURNT SACRIFICE? (Genesis 22:1-18)WITHOUT SATAN DISTORTING THE SCRIPTURES OF THE BIBLE, ISLAM CANNOT BE PREACHED!!THUS, ISLAM IS A DEPENDENT RELIGION.Now, Muslims, answer the following questions:Provide historical proof before Muhammad's birth that Ishmael was a Muslim.Provide evidence that existed before the Quran and Muhammad that Ishmael was a Muslim.Provide evidence of Allah speaking to Ishmael.Why do Muslims use a Bible they do not believe in to defend Ishmael?IF YOU PROVIDE ME ANSWERS WITH QURANIC VERSES AND WITHOUT INSULTS, I WILL CONVERT TO ISLAM TODAY.It is I, Dr. Max Shimba, a servant of Jesus Christ, the Great God.For Max Shimba Ministries Org.www.maxshimbaministries.comOther references:The Encyclopedia of Religion, Vol. 7, pg. 296 where the connection between the Midianites and the Ishmaelites is noted.The Shorter Encyclopedia of Islam, pgs. 178-179.A Popular Dictionary of Islam, p. 127.Halabieh, I, page 93 ; comments on Ibn Hisham, page mHalabieh I, page 36Masudi, Muruj al-Thahab, Beirut-Lebanon, 1991, II, pages 280-282Halabieh, I, page 35, 36Tarikh al-Tabari, I , page 127Tarikh al-Tabari, I, page 127Tarikh al-Tabari, I, page 127Diwan Ummiah bin Abi al-Salt, ( Beirut-1938), page 58Tarikh al-Tabari, I, page 128Tarikh al-Tabari, I, page 128Tarikh al-Tabari, I, page 516K.A.

NO WONDER THE QURAN DECLARES MUSLIMS AS INFIDELSTHAT'S WHY I SAY THAT THIS QURAN THAT DECLARES MUSLIMS AS INFIDELS IS NOT THE BOOK OF GODDear reader,Without wasting time, let's start with a verse from the Quran that says Allah used to abrogate His own verses. This is a huge problem.This habit of abrogating and changing verses is what is called infidelity. The word \"kafir\" means to alter the truth, or hide the truth, or tell lies, or falsely attribute lies to God, or reject God's instructions that came before the Quran and before Muhammad's birth.NOW LET'S READ ABOUT THIS INFIDEL HABIT OF ALLAH IN ISLAMQuran 2:106:\"Any revelation We abrogate or cause to be forgotten, We bring one better than it or similar to it. Do you not know that Allah has power over all things?\"Why was Allah abrogating His verses? How can we trust a Quran that was abrogated? That is why I say this altered Quran is what turns Muslims into infidels.The famous Islamic writer Caliph Uthman wrote the Quran and burned the verses he was not pleased with! (Sahih Bukhari 6:61:510)He did not just burn the verses, but entire chapters of the Quran were lost and forgotten. (Sahih Muslim 5:2286)Moreover, some verses were deliberately abrogated. (Bukhari 6:61:527).Muhammad instructed Muslims to learn Islam from the Quran of Ubai and not the one written by Zayd Ibn Thabit (which is the modern one) (Bukhari 6:61:521).Ibn Sad (Kitab al-Tabaqat al-Kabir vol.2 p.444)says that the writings of Zayd Ibn Thabit's Quran were different from Muhammad's. Therefore, believers have been misled by memorizing this modern Quran, and this Quran is what turns Muslims into infidels.Jami At-Tirmidhi 3104also says the current Quran is fake - by Zayd Ibn Thabit.In making many corrections to the Quran, people came up with different copies of the Quran (Jami at-Tirmidhi 3104), causing confusion among Muhammad's followers because they were different.Ibn Masood's Quran had 111 chapters, Ubay's had 116 chapters, and Zayd's Quran (which is the one in use now) has 114 chapters. See (Ibn Daud, Kitab al-Masahif).Even those declared fake were not preserved because a goat ate parts of their verses (Sunan Ibn Majah 1934/1944).So no one wrote the Quran until some of those who had memorized Muhammad's teachings died, and there was fear that the remaining verses would be lost entirely (Bukhari z6:61:509).This is how Zayd Ibn Thabit came to write the Quran we have today from the testimonies of the remaining memorizers (just a few pages from 23 years of revelation).SENSITIVE QUESTIONS ARISE HERE:Why was Allah abrogating Quranic verses?Why did Caliph Uthman burn Quranic verses?Why do Muslims hide the truth about their religion?CONSIDER THESE QUESTIONS AND TAKE ACTION!REJECT THE QURAN THAT MAKES YOU AN INFIDEL.Max Shimba Ministries Org",

Furthermore, many Muslims reject translations of the Qur'an in other languages. Translations are not considered legitimate versions of the Qur'an, which exists only in Arabic.That is why, when Muslims pray to Muhammad, they use Arabic worldwide. So, what language does Allah speak if not Arabic?And the Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said:\"Whoever reads a letter from the Book of Allah will be credited with a good deed, and a good deed is worth ten times its value. I do not say that Alif-Laam-Meem (A.L.M.) is a letter, but Alif is a letter, Laam is a letter, and Meem is a letter.\" [At-Tirmidhi, and he said it is a Hasan Sahih Hadith].The only language recognized by Allah along with His Prophet is Arabic, and this is the language Allah uses where He is.What language does Allah use to speak with Hell if not Arabic?All demons and jinn have Arabic names, and the language they used to communicate with Muhammad when reciting the Qur'an was Arabic. This is the language of demons and jinn.So, if all demons/jinn are thrown into Hell, what language will they use if not Arabic?AL-KASHIF, VOLUME TWENTY-SIX, Verses 29 – 32:Jinn listen to the Qur'an. Above, we read that the Qur'an was revealed in Arabic, thus these jinn/demons listened to the Qur'an in Arabic.Now, let's read a Sahih Hadith: Bukhari :: Book 6 :: Volume 60 :: Hadith 371 Narrated Anas: The Prophet of Allah said, \"People will be thrown into Hell (Hellfire), and as a result, Hell will say, 'Are there any more?' (50:30) until Allah places His foot over it, and Hell will say, 'Qati! Qati!' (Enough, enough!).\"The words \"Enough, enough\" - \"Qati Qati! Qati! Qati!\" - are in Arabic. So, even Hell speaks Arabic.Christians who are aware cannot be Muslims because even their language is the language of Hell.Shalom.Dr. Max Shimba, servant of Jesus Christ, the Great God. Titus 2:13",

'Go to the Christians to learn and become a Christian.' He refused because the jinn within him forbade him from seeking salvation, that is, becoming a Christian.Gabriel's message could not enter Muhammad because the jinn had blocked every part. In his spirit, there were 40,000 jinn preventing him from receiving God's message and words; in his mind, there were 30,000 jinn, and in his eyes, there were 10,000 jinn. After being controlled in these parts, Muhammad was not ready to listen to any message from God.\"\"SAVE US FROM THE EVIL ONE, THE WORLD OF JINN,\" JOSHUA KANANI CHABU - GRADUATED FROM AL-AZHAR UNIVERSITY CAIRO, p. 28What about believers being possessed by jinn?According to the same book, Muslim women believers are possessed by these jinn when they go to the mosque. On page 34, it explains one of the tasks of a jinn named Arafu.It is written:\"The task of pleasing womenMuslim women who hold firmly to their Islamic faith can be possessed by a 'male jinn' who gives them great pleasure, to the extent that they may not desire their husbands for up to 30 days. This jinn is one of those that entered during their conversion to Islam. When a woman prays in the mosque, she sits without underwear. This tradition has ancient origins and its own narratives, for example, Aisha spoke of it. The father respects a woman who has been possessed by a jinn. There are also female jinn for pleasing men.\"Muhammad s.a.w and Muslims lived/live after the time of Jesus Christ (570-632 AD).When Jesus Christ was on earth, one of the missions He gave His apostles was to cast out demons (evil spirits). It is written:“Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy, drive out demons; freely you have received, freely give.” (Matthew 10:8)It is also written:\"1 They went across the lake to the region of the Gerasenes.2 When Jesus got out of the boat, a man with an impure spirit came from the tombs to meet him.3 This man lived in the tombs, and no one could bind him anymore, not even with a chain.4 For he had often been chained hand and foot, but he tore the chains apart and broke the irons on his feet. No one was strong enough to subdue him.5 Night and day among the tombs and in the hills he would cry out and cut himself with stones.6 When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell on his knees in front of him.7 He shouted at the top of his voice, 'What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? In God’s name don’t torture me!'8 For Jesus had said to him, 'Come out of this man, you impure spirit!'9 Then Jesus asked him, 'What is your name?' 'My name is Legion,' he replied, 'for we are many.'10 And he begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of the area.11 A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside.12 The demons begged Jesus, 'Send us among the pigs; allow us to go into them.'13 He gave them permission, and the impure spirits came out and went into the pigs. The herd, about two thousand in number, rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned.” (Mark 5:1-13)I wonder, why did Muhammad s.a.w continue to suffer from those 80,000 jinn until he died instead of going to Christians to be prayed for and freed from them?Moreover, why do Muslim women reject Jesus while they are at risk of being possessed by jinn? When they remove their underwear in the mosque, do they know who they are undressing for?I wonder greatly, and I encourage you to ponder deeply about this situation.Shalom,Max Shimba Ministries Org.",

This is not true. Because in Arabic, Jesus is called Yasu’a, not Isa. It should be noted that the Bible existed on earth approximately 1500 years before the Qur’an. (The Qur’an is a post-Bible book).Our argument for Muslims is who changed the name Yasu’a to Isa? The name Yasu’a is more similar to the name Yehoshua, which is in Hebrew, and in Greek, the language used to write the New Testament, He is called Iesous (pronounced Jesus). The translation of these words into Swahili is Savior.We read this in Matthew 1:21-23, “And she will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins.” All this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, “Behold, the virgin shall be with child and bear a Son, and they shall call His name Immanuel,” which is translated, “God with us.”Our question is, is Isa a.s. also the Savior and Immanuel as Jesus Christ is?Another point to consider when examining their differences is about their mothers. Jesus Christ’s mother is Mary, who comes from the tribe of Judah. We read this in Genesis 49:10, “The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh comes; and to Him shall be the obedience of the people.”This prophecy was fulfilled in Jesus Christ. We read this in Hebrews 7:14, “For it is evident that our Lord arose from Judah, of which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood.”But when we read about Isa, his mother is from the family of Imran, who is the father of Aaron, Miriam, and Moses. We read this in Suratul Al-Maryam 19:28, “O sister of Aaron! Your father was not a man of evil, nor was your mother unchaste.”The interpretation of this verse 19:28 in the Qur’an, translation by King Fahd, p. 405, reads, “This Harun (Aaron) is not the brother of Musa (Moses), but he was another pious man at the time of Maryam (Mary).”Translation: “This Aaron is not the brother of Moses but was another pious man who lived during the time of Mary.”According to the Bible, Aaron is the son of Amram and their mother is named Jochebed, and they had three children: Aaron, Miriam, and their younger brother Moses. We read this in Numbers 26:59, “The name of Amram’s wife was Jochebed, a descendant of Levi, who was born to the Levites in Egypt; and to Amram she bore Aaron, Moses, and their sister Miriam.”Another difference is their creation:ISA WAS CREATED. Qur’an Suratul Imran, 3:59, “Indeed, the example of Jesus to Allah is like that of Adam. He created him from dust; then He said to him, 'Be,' and he was.”But when we read aboutJESUS, HE WAS NOT CREATED BUT IS THE WORD OF GOD.John 1:1,14, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God… And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us…”Micah 5:2, “But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of you shall come forth to Me the One to be Ruler in Israel, whose goings forth are from of old, from everlasting.”John 8:58, “Jesus said to them, 'Most assuredly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I AM.'”Furthermore, the Bible informs us that He is the Creator Himself.John 1:3, “All things were made through Him, and without Him, nothing was made that was made.”Colossians 1:16-17, “For by Him all things were created that are in heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were created through Him and for Him.”(A)ISA A.S.: AFTER HIS DEPARTURE, (AS MUSLIMS BELIEVE), HE HAS NEVER APPEARED IN ANY WAY.(B)JESUS CHRIST: AFTER HIS DEPARTURE, HE APPEARED TO PAUL (SAUL).Acts 9:4, “Then he fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?' And he said, 'Who are You, Lord?' Then the Lord said, 'I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.'”(A)ISA A.S.: PROPHESIED THE COMING OF MUHAMMAD.Qur’an Suratul As-Saff, 61:6,“And (remember) when Jesus, son of Mary, said, ‘O children of Israel! I am the Messenger of Allah unto you confirming the Torah before me and giving glad tidings of a Messenger to come after me, whose name shall be Ahmad (another name for Muhammad).’ But when he came to them with clear proofs, they said, ‘This is plain magic.’”(B)JESUS CHRIST SENT THE HOLY SPIRIT ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST.John 14:26, “But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I said to you.” In Greek, He is called “Paracletos,” meaning helper or comforter.John 15:26, “But when the Helper comes, whom I shall send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father, He will testify of Me.”John 16:7, “Nevertheless, I tell you the truth. It is to your advantage that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send Him to you.”(A)ISA A.S.: HIS NAME HAS NO POWER OR SAVING ABILITY BUT IS TWO-TONED.In Al-Lu’lu’war-Marjani, Volume 1, Hadith 104, p. 64, “The Hadith of Ibn Abbas (r.a) from the Prophet (s.a.w) said, ‘I saw Moses (a.s) on the night of Al-Isra, and he was a tall man with brown curly hair like a man of the Shanua. And I saw Isa (a.s), and he was a man of medium build, inclined to redness and whiteness, with straight hair...’”(B)JESUS CHRIST: HIS NAME IS SALVATION.Acts 4:9-10,12, “If we this day are judged for a good deed done to a helpless man, by what means he has been made well, let it be known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, by Him this man stands here before you whole… Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.”Some verses in the Qur’an say Isa a.s. healed the blind. Who were these people? Can we name at least one? Jesus healed the blind Bartimaeus.Other verses say Isa a.s. raised the dead. Who were these people? Jesus raised Lazarus.The name we are given is only one name with salvation, the name of Jesus Christ. How is the name Isa a.s., which has no salvation, associated with the name Jesus Christ of Nazareth, which has salvation?Acts 16:31, “So they said, ‘Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you and your household.’”(A)ISA A.S.: HE IS NOT THE SON OF GOD.Qur’an Suratul Al-An’am, 6:101, “He is the Creator of the heavens and the earth. How could He have a son when He has no consort? He created all things, and He has knowledge of all things.”Qur’an Suratul At-Tawba (Repentance), 9:30, “The Jews say, ‘Ezra is the son of Allah,’ and the Christians say, ‘The Messiah is the son of Allah.’ That is their saying with their mouths, resembling the saying of those who disbelieved aforetime. Allah’s curse be on them: how they are deluded away from the truth!”The doctrine of the Sonship of God as taught in the Bible is not found in the teachings and beliefs of Islam; therefore, Isa a.s. is not the Son of God.(B)JESUS CHRIST: HE IS THE SON OF GOD.Luke 1:30-31,35, “Then the angel said to her, ‘Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bring forth a Son, and shall call His name Jesus.’ The angel answered and said to her, ‘The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Highest will overshadow you; therefore, also, that Holy One who is to be born will be called the Son of God.’”Therefore, Isa is not the Son of God, but Jesus is the Son of God. Therefore, Jesus is not Isa.(A)ISA A.S.: HE IS NOT GOD INCARNATE.Suratul Al-Maidah (The Table Spread), 5:72-73, “Certainly they disbelieve who say: ‘Allah is the Messiah, the son of Mary.’ But the Messiah said: ‘O Children of Israel! Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.’ Whoever joins other gods with Allah, Allah will forbid him the Garden, and the Fire will be his abode. And for the wrongdoers, there will be no helpers. Surely, disbelievers are those who said: ‘Allah is the third of the three (in a Trinity).’ But there is no deity except One Allah. If they do not desist from what they are saying, surely a painful punishment will befall the disbelievers among them.”(B)JESUS: HE IS THE WORD OF GOD INCARNATE.John 1:1,14, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God… And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us…”(A)ISA A.S.: HE WAS NEITHER CRUCIFIED NOR KILLED.Qur’an Suratul An-Nisaa (The Women) 4:157-158, “And because of their saying (in boast), ‘We killed Messiah Jesus, son of Mary, the Messenger of Allah,’ but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but the resemblance of Jesus was put over another man (and they killed that man), and those who differ therein are full of doubts. They have no certain knowledge; they follow nothing but conjecture. For surely; they killed him not. But Allah raised him up unto Himself. And Allah is Ever All-Powerful, All-Wise.”(B)JESUS CHRIST: HE WAS CRUCIFIED ON THE CROSS.John 19:18,31,33, “There they crucified Him, and with Him two others, one on either side, and Jesus in the center… Therefore, because it was the Preparation Day, that the bodies should not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away… But when they came to Jesus and saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs.”(A)ISA A.S.: HE DOES NOT DESERVE TO BE WORSHIPPED BY ANY HUMAN.Qur’an, Suratul Al-Maidah, 5:116, “And [beware the Day] when Allah will say, ‘O Jesus, son of Mary, did you say to the people, ‘Take me and my mother as deities besides Allah?’’ He will say, ‘Exalted are You! It was not for me to say that to which I have no right. If I had said it, You would have known it. You know what is within myself, and I do not know what is within Yourself. Indeed, it is You who is Knower of the unseen.’”(B)JESUS DESERVES TO BE WORSHIPPED BY HUMANS AND ANGELS.Matthew 2:2, “Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we have seen His star in the East and have come to worship Him.”John 9:35-38, “Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when He had found him, He said to him, ‘Do you believe in the Son of God?’ He answered and said, ‘Who is He, Lord, that I may believe in Him?’ And Jesus said to him, ‘You have both seen Him and it is He who is talking with you.’ Then he said, ‘Lord, I believe!’ And he worshiped Him.”Philippians 2:10-11, “That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, and of those on earth, and of those under the earth, and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.”Hebrews 1:6, “But when He again brings the firstborn into the world, He says: ‘Let all the angels of God worship Him.’”(A)ISA DOES NOT DESERVE TO BE AN INTERCESSOR FOR PEOPLE TO GOD.Sahih Al-Bukhari, vol.6, Hadith no. 3, The Noble Qur’an, English Translation, p. 8, “…….Go to Musa, the servant of Allah who spoke to Allah directly and was given the Torah. So they will go to him and he will say, ‘I am not fit for this task of intercession,’ and he will mention his mistake of killing a person who was not a killer, and so he will feel ashamed before his Lord and will say, ‘Go to Isa, the servant of Allah, His Messenger, His Word and a soul created by Him.’ Isa will say, ‘I am not fit for the task of intercession…’”(B)JESUS DESERVES TO BE AN INTERCESSOR FOR HUMANS TO GOD.1 Timothy 2:5, “For there is one God and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus.”Hebrews 7:24-25, “But He, because He continues forever, has an unchangeable priesthood. Therefore He is also able to save to the uttermost those who come to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them.”(A)ISA IS JUST ANOTHER PROPHET LIKE OTHERS.Qur’an Suratul Baqarah (The Cow), 2:136, “Say (O Muslims): ‘We believe in Allah and that which has been sent down to us and that which has been sent down to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and to Al-Asbat (the twelve sons of Jacob), and that which has been given to Moses and Jesus, and that which has been given to the Prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and to Him we have submitted.’”(B)JESUS IS ABOVE ALL THINGS.Ephesians 1:20-23, “Which He worked in Christ when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality and power and might and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in that which is to come. And He put all things under His feet and gave Him to be head over all things to the church, which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all.”(A)ISA, WHEN HE RETURNS, WILL MARRY AND HAVE CHILDREN.Mishkat Al-Masabih, vol. 2, p. 1159, Sahih Muslim, vol. 1, p. 92, “When Isa returns, he will live for forty years, during which he will marry and have children, and will perform the pilgrimage.”(B)WHEN JESUS RETURNS, HE WILL COME TO TAKE UP THE CHURCH, WHICH IS THE BRIDE.Ephesians 5:25-26, 32-33, “Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself for her, that He might sanctify and cleanse her with the washing of water by the word… This is a great mystery, but I speak concerning Christ and the church. Nevertheless let each one of you in particular so love his own wife as himself, and let the wife see that she respects her husband.”Revelation 19:7, “Let us be glad and rejoice and give Him glory, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready.”(A)ISA WILL DIE AFTER LIVING FOR FORTY YEARS.Mishkat Al-Masabih, vol. 2, p. 1159, Sunan Abu Dawud, Hadith 4310, Sahih Muslim, vol.1, p. 92, “When Isa returns, he will abolish all religions except Islam. He will destroy the Antichrist, and he will live on earth for forty years and then die. After his death, he will be buried next to Muhammad.”(B)JESUS, AFTER HIS RESURRECTION, IS ALIVE FOREVERMORE AND DOES NOT DIE AGAIN.Romans 6:9, “Knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, dies no more. Death no longer has dominion over Him.”Hebrews 7:24-25, “But He, because He continues forever, has an unchangeable priesthood. Therefore He is also able to save to the uttermost those who come to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them.”Revelation 1:17-18, “And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet as dead. But He laid His right hand on me, saying to me, ‘Do not be afraid; I am the First and the Last. I am He who lives, and was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore. Amen. And I have the keys of Hades and of Death.’”(A)WHEN ISA WAS BORN, A VOICE OF COMFORT CAME FROM UNDER THE GROUND.Qur’an Suratul Maryam, 19:23-24, “And the pains of childbirth drove her to the trunk of a date-palm. She said, ‘Oh, I wish I had died before this and was in oblivion, forgotten.’ Then he called her from below her, ‘Do not grieve; your Lord has provided beneath you a stream.’”Islamic teachings explain that under the ground, there is an animal that knows the verses of the Qur’an.Qur’an in Suratul Al-Naml, 27:82, “And when the Word befalls them, We will bring forth for them a creature from the earth, speaking to them, that the people were of Our verses not certain [in faith].”(B)WHEN JESUS WAS BORN, ANGELIC VOICES CAME FROM ABOVE.Luke 2:13-16, “And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying, ‘Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, goodwill toward men!’ So it was, when the angels had gone away from them into heaven, that the shepherds said to one another, ‘Let us now go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has come to pass, which the Lord has made known to us.’ And they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the Babe lying in a manger.”(A)ISA HAS NO KNOWLEDGE OF VARIOUS THINGS.In Al-Lu’lu’ war-Marjan, book 3, Hadith no. 1528, p. 883, “Hadith of Abu Huraira (r.a) from the Prophet (s.a.w) said, ‘Isa Ibn Mariam (a.s) saw a man stealing and asked him, ‘Did you steal?’ He said, ‘No, by Allah, there is no god but Him.’ Isa (a.s) said, ‘I believed in Allah, and my eye has lied to me.’”(B)JESUS KNOWS EVERYTHING.John 1:47-48, “Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward Him and said of him, ‘Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no deceit!’ Nathanael said to Him, ‘How do You know me?’ Jesus answered and said to him, ‘Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.’”John 2:24-25, “But Jesus did not commit Himself to them, because He knew all men, and had no need that anyone should testify of man, for He knew what was in man.”(A)ISA A.S.: HIS MOTHER WAS FOUND BESIDE A MOSQUE WHEN SHE RECEIVED THE NEWS OF HIS BIRTH.Qur’an Suratul Maryam, 19:16-17, “And mention in the Book, [the story of] Mary, when she withdrew from her family to a place toward the east. And she took, in seclusion from them, a screen. Then We sent to her Our angel, and he represented himself to her as a well-proportioned man.”(B)JESUS CHRIST: HIS MOTHER WAS FOUND AT HER HOME IN NAZARETH.Luke 1:26-28, “Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. The virgin’s name was Mary. And having come in, the angel said to her, ‘Rejoice, highly favored one, the Lord is with you; blessed are you among women!’”(A)THE PREGNANCY OF ISA WAS OF ONE DAY.Qur’an Suratul Maryam, 19:21-22, “[The angel] said, ‘Thus [it will be]; your Lord says, ‘It is easy for Me, and We will make him a sign to the people and a mercy from Us. And it is a matter [already] decreed.’ So she conceived him, and she withdrew with him to a remote place.”(B)THE PREGNANCY OF JESUS: THE DAYS WERE FULFILLED.Luke 2:6-7, “So it was, that while they were there, the days were completed for her to be delivered. And she brought forth her firstborn Son, and wrapped Him in swaddling cloths, and laid Him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.”Note: The sixth month mentioned in Luke 1:26 refers to the age of the pregnancy of John inside Elizabeth’s womb. Luke 1:36, “Now indeed, Elizabeth your relative has also conceived a son in her old age; and this is now the sixth month for her who was called barren.”Note: The manger mentioned here means a feeding trough for animals in a stable. In Greek (the language in which the New Testament was written), this is called “Fatne,” and in English, it is called “a manger.”WHEN ISA (A.S.) RETURNS, HE WILL BREAK THE CROSSES AND KILL THE PIGS.Mishkat Al-Masabih, vol. 3-4, p. 20, Hadith no. 753, “The Hour will not be established until the son of Maryam (Isa a.s.) descends among you as a just ruler. He will break the crosses (of the Christians in the churches) and kill the pigs, and abolish the Jizya (tax); and wealth will become so abundant that nobody will accept it.” Also, see Sahih Bukhari, vol. 3, Hadith no. 425, Al-Lu’lu’ war-Marjan, vol. 1, Hadith no. 95, p. 51, The Noble Qur’an, p. 757.(B)WHEN JESUS CHRIST RETURNS, HE WILL SEND HIS ANGELS TO GATHER THE SAINTS.Matthew 24:30-31, “Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. And He will send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they will gather together His elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.”WARNING OF JESUS CHRIST OF NAZARETHMatthew 24:24, “For false christs and false prophets will rise and show great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect.” (See also Mark 13:22)John 8:24, “Therefore I said to you that you will die in your sins; for if you do not believe that I am He, you will die in your sins.”YOU, THE ELECT, WILL YOU BE DECEIVED AND MISLED TO BELIEVE THAT INDEED ISA A.S. IS JESUS CHRIST? IF YOU BELIEVE SO, YOU WILL BE DECEIVED AND MISS THE SALVATION OF GOD!!!!!!!!!!JESUS CHRIST, HE IS IMMANUEL, WONDERFUL COUNSELOR, MIGHTY GOD, EVERLASTING FATHER, PRINCE OF PEACE!!!!

    "full_content": "The Hadith of BukhariHundreds of thousands of hadiths (narratives) claim to describe the teachings and actions of Muhammad and his close followers. Early Muslims scrutinized these hadiths to determine which among them were genuine. There are six collections of hadiths considered \"sahih\" or authentic and authoritative by Sunnis. These hadiths are regarded as nearly as important as the Quran itself. The longest collection is Sahih al-Bukhari, which contains nine volumes and 7,275 hadiths. The following points are particularly noteworthy for both Muslim and non-Muslim readers from the hadiths of the Bukhari collection. These excerpts are taken from the book \"The Translation of the Meanings of Sahih Al-Bukhari\" by Dr. Muhammad Muhsin Khan of the Islamic University of Madinah Al-Munawwara, Saudi Arabia.Muhammad Is Not Worshipped\"After that, Abu Bakr said the Tashah-hud (i.e., none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Messenger)... Abu Bakr said, 'Whoever worshipped Muhammad, Muhammad is dead, but whoever worships Allah, Allah is alive and will never die. Allah said: 'Muhammad is no more than a Messenger...'\" Bukhari, Volume 2, Book 23 (Funerals), Chapter 3, No. 333, p.188-189.However, Muslims greatly revere Muhammad. \"By Allah, whenever the Prophet of Allah spat, it would fall into the hand of one of (i.e., the companions of the Prophet) who would rub it on his face and skin; when he ordered them, they carried out his orders immediately; when he performed ablution, they almost fought for the remaining water; and when they spoke to him, they would lower their voices and would not look at him directly out of respect.\" Bukhari, Volume 3, Book 50 (Conditions), Chapter 13, No. 891, p.564-565.Prohibition of Intoxicants\"Aisha [the wife of Muhammad] narrated that the Prophet said, 'Every intoxicant is prohibited to drink.'\" Bukhari, Volume 1, Book 4 (Ablution), Chapter 75, No. 243, p.153.\"Abu Huraira narrated: 'The Prophet said, 'An adulterer, at the time he is committing illegal sexual intercourse, is not a believer; and a person, at the time of drinking an alcoholic drink, is not a believer; and a thief, at the time of stealing, is not a believer.'\" Bukhari, Volume 7, Book 69 (Drinks), Chapter 1, No. 484, p.339.Muslims are also forbidden from selling wine, idols, and pork. Sahih Muslim, Volume 3, Book 9 (Business Transactions), Chapter 621-622, No. 3835-3840, p.828-830. They are not allowed to buy, sell, or carry wine. Ibn Majah, Volume 4, Book 30 (Drinks), No. 3380-3381, p.493-494; Volume 4, Book 30, No. 3382, p.494. The selling of wine is forbidden in Bukhari, Volume 1, Book 8 (Prayer), Chapter 73, No. 449, p.267.Did Muhammad See the Moon Split in Two?\"The pagans asked the Prophet to show them a miracle, so he showed them the splitting of the moon. 'Abdullah bin Masud narrated: 'During the lifetime of the Prophet, the moon was split into two parts and on that the Prophet said, 'Bear witness (to this).'\" Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 56 (Virtues and Merits of the Prophet and His Companions), Chapter 26, No. 830, p. 533.\"Anas narrated that the people of Makkah asked Allah's Messenger to show them a miracle, and so he showed them the moon split in two.\" Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 56 (Virtues and Merits of the Prophet and His Companions), Chapter 26, No. 831, p.533.\"Ibn Abbas narrated: 'The moon was split into two parts during the lifetime of the Prophet.'\" Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 56 (Virtues and Merits of the Prophet and His Companions), Chapter 26, No. 832, p.534.Stars Should Strike the Devils?\"The creation of the stars was made for three purposes, i.e., as decorations of the sky, as missiles to hit the devils, and as signs to guide travelers. So, anyone who tries to find a different interpretation is mistaken and wastes his efforts...\" Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 54 (Beginning of Creation), Chapter 3, Commentary by Translator before No. 421, p.282.Memory of Abu Huraira\"Abu Huraira narrated: 'I said, 'O Allah's Messenger! I hear many narrations from you but I forget them.' He said, 'Spread your garment.' I did accordingly and then he moved his hands as if scooping something and emptied it in the garment and said, 'Wrap it.' I wrapped it around my body, and since then I have never forgotten a single Hadith.\" Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 56 (Virtues and Merits of the Prophet and His Companions), Chapter 27, No. 841, p.538. Also, Bukhari, Volume 9, Book 92 (Holding Fast to the Quran and Sunnah), Chapter 22, No. 452, p.332; Volume 1, Book 3 (Knowledge), Chapter 43, No. 119, p.89.Satan in Your Nose\"Abu Huraira narrated: 'The Prophet said, 'If anyone of you rouses from sleep and performs the ablution, he should wash his nose by putting water in it and then blowing it out thrice because Satan stays in the upper part of the nose all night.'\" (1) Translator's note (1) says, \"We should believe that Satan actually stays in the upper part of a person's nose, though we cannot perceive how, for this involves the unseen world about which we cannot know anything except what Allah tells us through His Messenger.\" Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 54 (Beginning of Creation), Chapter 10, No. 516, p.328.Believing Muhammad Despite the Presence of Flies\"Abu Huraira narrated: 'The Prophet said, 'If a fly falls into the drink of any one of you, he should dip it (in the drink), for one of its wings has a disease and the other has the cure for that disease.'\" Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 54 (Beginning of Creation), Chapter 16, No. 537, p.338. See also Abu Dawud, Volume 3, Book 21 (Food), No. 3835, p.1080.\"Abu Huraira narrated: 'The Prophet of Allah said, 'If a fly falls into the vessel of any one of you, let him dip it in the vessel and then throw it away, for in one of its wings there is disease and in the other there is healing (1) (antidote), i.e., treatment for that disease.\" Bukhari, Volume 7, Book 71 (Medicine), Chapter 58, No. 673, p.452-453.Translator's note (1) says, \"In the medical science, it is well known today that flies carry pathogens on some parts of their bodies as stated by the Prophet (nearly 1400 years ago when human knowledge of modern medical science was very limited.) Similarly, Allah has created microorganisms and their actions that can kill these pathogens, e.g., Penicillin Fungus can kill bacteria like Staphylococci and others. Recently, experiments have shown that flies carry both disease-causing pathogens and their antidotes. Normally, when a fly touches a liquid, it contaminates it with its pathogens, thus it must be dipped to release the antidotes to counteract the pathogens. Regarding this subject, I also wrote to my friend Dr. Muhammad M. El-SAMAHY, Head of the Hadith Department at Al-Azhar University, Cairo, Egypt, who wrote an article about this Hadith concerning medical science, stating that microbiologists have proven that there are longitudinal parasitic germs living as pathogens inside the fly's stomach, which these parasitic germs come out through the respiratory tracts of the fly, and if the fly is dipped into the liquid, these germs burst into the liquid and the substances within these germs are antidotes for the pathogens carried by the fly.\"Most doctors, if not Muslim, ridicule the idea of deliberately dipping a fly into your drink.Muhammad Had Sins\"Abu Huraira narrated: ... What do you say between the Takbir and the recitation? The Prophet said, ... O Lord! Keep me away from my sins as the East and West are apart from each other and clean me from sins as a white garment is cleaned from dirt (after thorough washing). O Lord! Wash away my sins with water, snow, and hail.\" Bukhari, Volume 1, Book 12 (Characteristics of Prayer), Chapter 8, No. 711, p.398.

One day he invoked (Allah) for a long period and then said, 'I feel that Allah has inspired me as how to cure myself.'...\" Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 54 (Beginning of Creation), Chapter 10, No. 490, p.317.

Also see Sahih Muslim, Volume 2, Book 4 (Prayer), Chapter 309, No. 1888, p.411.\"‘Aisha narrated: The Prophet continued for such and such a period imagining that he had had sexual relations with his wives which in fact he had not. One day he said to me, 'O ‘Aisha! Allah has instructed me regarding the matter about which I asked Him. Two persons came to me (in a dream), one of them sat near my head and the other near my feet. The one near my head asked the other, pointing to me, 'What is wrong with this man?' The latter replied, 'He is under the effect of magic.' The first one asked, 'Who had worked magic on him?' The other replied, 'Lubaid bin A'sam.' The first one asked, '(Under what material) has it been done?' The other replied, 'Under a skin of the pollen of a male date palm tree kept under a stone in the well of Dharwan.' Then the Prophet went to that well and said, 'This is the same well which was shown to me (in the dream). Its water looked like the infusion of henna leaves and its date-palm trees looked like the heads of devils.' ... ‘Aisha added, '(The magician) Lubaid bin A'sam was one of Bani Zuraiq, an ally of the Jews.'\" Bukhari, Volume 8, Book 73 (Good Manners), Chapter 56, No. 89, p.57. See also Bukhari, Volume 8, Book 75 (Invocations), Chapter 59, No. 400, p.266.The Daughters of AllahIn pre-Muhammad Arabia, Muhammad's tribe, the Quraysh, believed in a god named Allah (or Al'Ilah) who had three daughters called Al-Lat, Al-Uzza, and Manat.\"'Urwa said, ... regarding Ansar who used to consider Ihram while worshipping an idol called 'Manat' whom they used to worship at a place called Al-Mushallal...\" Bukhari, Volume 2, Book 26 (Pilgrimage), Chapter 78, No. 706, p.413.\"This verse was revealed concerning Ansar who used to consider Ihram for the idol Manat which was placed at a place called Qudaid...\" Bukhari, Volume 3, Book 27 (Umra), Chapter 10, No. 18, p.11. Al-Lat, Al-Uzza are described in Bukhari, Volume 8, Book 74 (Asking Permission), Chapter 52, No. 314, p.209; Volume 5, No. 375, p.259.Verses Removed from the Quran\"After that, Allah revealed a verse which was among those that were abrogated later.\" Bukhari, Volume 5, Book 59 (Military Expeditions), Chapter 27, No. 416, p.288.\"Anas bin Malik narrated: ... Allah revealed verses for those who were killed at Bir-Ma'una, and we used to recite those verses, but they were later cancelled. The verses were: 'Inform our people that we have met our Lord. He is pleased with us, and we are pleased with Him.'\" Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 52 (Jihad), Chapter 19, No. 69, p.53. See also the History of al-Tabari, Volume 7, p.156.Other mentions of abrogated verses are Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 52 (Jihad), Chapter 8, No. 57, p.45, Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 52 (Jihad), Chapter 184, No. 299, p.191, and Bukhari, Volume 5, Book 59 (Military Expeditions), Chapter 27, No. 421, p.293, all recounting the same verse.At one time, Muhammad agreed to say regarding the daughters of Allah in Surah 53:19, \"their intercession is to be hoped for.\" Muhammad said we should rely on the help of these three idols.Muhammad's followers were surprised that he said this. Later, Muhammad changed his position, saying that Satan had deceived him. These verses were abrogated or removed. Islamic scholars call these verses \"the Satanic Verses.\" It is intriguing to read Islamic explanations of how a true prophet could say such things.Unlike JesusOne thing that Christians and many Muslims agree on is that Jesus was sinless. By comparison, read about the life of Jesus in the Gospels.Muhammad and Selling Slaves\"Anas bin Malik narrated: The Prophet of Allah was on a journey, and he had a black slave named Anjasha, and he was driving the camels...\" Bukhari, Volume 8, Book 73 (Good Manners), Chapter 95, No. 182, p.117.\"Anas narrated: ... And Anjashah, the slave of the Prophet [Muhammad], was driving the camels...\" Bukhari, Volume 8, Book 73 (Good Manners), Chapter 111, No. 221, p.142.\"Jabir bin 'Abdullah narrated: A man among us declared that his slave would be freed after his death. The Prophet called that slave and sold him (1). That slave died that year.\" Footnote (1) says, \"The master was in need of money, so the Prophet sold the slave on his behalf and allowed him to revoke his promise of freeing the slave after his death.\" Bukhari, Volume 3, Book 45 (Mortgaging in Places Occupied by Settled Population), Chapter 9, No. 711, p.427.\"Then a man named Rifa'a bin Zaid ... brought a slave named Mid'am to the Prophet of Allah\" Bukhari, Volume 8, Book 78 (Oaths and Vows), Chapter 33, No. 698, p.455.\"Selling of Mudabbar (i.e., a slave who was promised to be freed after the death of his master).\" (433) Jabir narrated: \"The Prophet sold a Mudabbar (on behalf of his master who was still alive and in need of money).\" Bukhari, Volume 3, Book 34 (Sales and Trade), Chapter 112, Volume 433, before p.238.\"A man from the Ansar declared his slave Mudabbar, and he had no other property except him. When the Prophet heard of that, he said (to his companions), 'Who will buy (i.e., the slave) for me?' Nu'aim bin An-Nahham bought him for eight hundred Dirham.\" Bukhari, Volume 8, Book 79 (Expiation for Unfulfilled Oaths), Chapter 7, No. 707, p.464.\"'Ammar narrated: 'I saw the Prophet of Allah and there was no one with him except five slaves, two women, and Abu Bakr (i.e., these were the only people who had embraced Islam at that time).\" Bukhari, Volume 5, Book 57 (Companions of the Prophet), Chapter 6, No. 12, p.8.\"[Ibn Az-Zubair] sent ['Aisha] ten slaves whom he freed as expiation for his oath. 'Aisha freed more slaves for the same purpose until she freed forty slaves. She said, 'Had I known I would specify what I would do if I failed to fulfill my vow when making it, so that I could fulfill it easily.'\" (1)Footnote (1) says, \"'Aisha did not specify what she would do if she failed to fulfill her vow; hence, she freed many slaves to ensure the adequacy of her expiation.\" Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 56 (Virtues and Merits of the Prophet and His Companions), Chapter 2, No. 708, p.465.\"And 'Ata did not like to look at the slave girls who were being sold in Makkah except when he wanted to buy.\" Bukhari, Volume 8, Book 74 (Asking Permission), Chapter 2, No. 246, p.162.Sexual Relations with Slaves and Captives\"Can a person travel with a pregnant slave girl without knowing whether she is pregnant or not? Al-Hasan saw no harm in a man kissing or caressing a pregnant slave girl without having intercourse with her.Ibn 'Umar said, 'If a slave girl fit for sexual relations was given as a gift to somebody, or was sold, or was set free, her master should not have sexual relations with her before she gets one menstrual period so as to be sure of the absence of pregnancy, and there is no such necessity for a virgin.''Atâ said, 'There is no harm in caressing a pregnant (1) slave girl without having sexual relations with her. Allah said: 'Except with those joined to them in the marriage bond, or (the captives) whom their right hands possess,- for (in their case) they are free from blame.\" Footnote (1) says, \"Pregnant by another, not her present master.\" Bukhari, Volume 3, Book 34 (Sales and Trade), Chapter 113 after No. 436, p.239-240. (Same section as 'Atâ as previously.)\"Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri narrated that while he was sitting with the Prophet of Allah, he said, 'O Allah's Messenger! We get female captives as our share of the war booty, and we are interested in their prices; what is your opinion about coitus interruptus?' The Prophet said, 'Do you really do that? It is better for you not to do it, for Allah has written whom He is going to create till the Day of Resurrection.'\" Bukhari, Volume 3, Book 34 (Sales and Trade), Chapter 111, No. 432, p.237.\"Ibn Muhairiz narrated: 'I entered the mosque and saw Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri and sat beside him and asked him about Al-'Azl (i.e., coitus interruptus). Abu Sa'id said, 'We went out with Allah's Messenger for the Ghazwa [battle] of Banu Al-Mustaliq and we received captives from among the captives of the Arabs and we desired the women and the celibacy became hard on us, and we loved to do coitus interruptus. So when we intended to do coitus interruptus, we said, 'How can we do coitus interruptus before asking Allah's Messenger who is present among us?' We asked him about it and he said, 'It is better for you not to do it, for Allah has destined whom He is going to create till the Day of Resurrection.'\" Bukhari, Volume 5, Book 59 (Military Expeditions), Chapter 31, No. 459, p.317. This part says the same as Bukhari, Volume 8, Book 77 (The Book of al-Qadr), Chapter 3, No. 600, p.391. In other words, whatever is to be will be, so do not prevent it unnaturally. Muhammad never condemned the harassment of captives or slaves that one owns.‘Aisha and Zainab bint Jahsh\"Hisham's father narrated: Khadija died three years before the Prophet departed to Madina. He stayed there for about two years and then he married ‘Aisha when she was a girl of six years of age, and he consummated that marriage when she was nine years old.\" Bukhari, Volume 5, Book 58 (Virtues of the Ansar), Chapter 43, No. 236, p.153. See Volume 5, Book 58 (Virtues of the Ansar), Chapter 43, No. 234, p.152.Zainab bint Jahsh was married to Muhammad's adopted son until Muhammad declared a Surah that he should divorce his son and marry Muhammad. Zainab \"used to boast to the other wives of the Prophet and used to say that Allah married her (to the Prophet) in the heavens.\" Bukhari, Volume 9, Book 93 (Oneness, Uniqueness of Allah), Chapter 22, No. 517, p.382; also see Book 93 (Oneness, Uniqueness of Allah), Chapter 22, No. 516, 518, p.381-383. In other words, the heavenly, uncreated, and eternal Quran mentioned Zainab's marriage.Islam and Women\"'How does any one of you beat his wife as he beats the stallion camel and then embrace (sleep) with her?' And Hisham said, 'As he beats his slave.'\" Bukhari, Volume 8, Book 73 (Good Manners), Chapter 43, No. 68, p.42.\"Abu Huraira narrated: 'The Prophet of Allah said, 'Treat women nicely, for a woman is created from a rib, and the most crooked portion of the rib is its upper part; so, if you try to straighten it, it will break, but if you leave it as it is, it will remain crooked. So treat women nicely.'\" Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 55 (Prophets), Chapter 1, No. 548, p.346.\"'Abdullah bin Qais Al-Ash'ari narrated: 'The Prophet said, 'In Paradise there is a pavilion made of a single hollow pearl thirty miles in height, in each corner of the pavilion, there are wives for the believer that cannot be seen by the others.'\" Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 54 (Beginning of Creation), Chapter 7, No. 466, p.306.Women in Islamic Law\"Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri narrated: 'The Prophet said, 'Is not the witness of a woman equal to half of that of a man?' The women said, 'Yes.' He said, 'This is because of the deficiency of a woman's mind.'\" Bukhari, Volume 3, Book 48 (Witnesses), Chapter 12, No. 826, p.502.\"Muhammad said, 'A nation which makes a woman their ruler will never be successful.'\" Bukhari, Volume 9, Book 88 (Afflictions and the End of the World), Chapter 18, No. 219, p.171.Temporary Marriage (Mut’a)\"'Ali bin Abi Talib narrated: 'On the day of Khaibar, Allah's Messenger forbade the Mut’a (i.e., temporary marriage) and the eating of donkey flesh.'\" Bukhari, Volume 5, Book 59 (Military Expeditions), Chapter 37, No. 527, p.372. Bukhari, Volume 7, Book 62 (Wedlock), Chapter 32, No. 50, 52, p.36, 37 also discuss this matter. Most Muslims except some Sunnis do not practice temporary marriage, while many Shias teach that it is permissible.Race Relations and Muhammad's Ownership of African Slaves\"Anas narrated: 'The Prophet said, 'Listen and obey (your chief) even if an Ethiopian whose head is like a raisin is made your chief.'\" Bukhari, Volume 1, Book 11 (Call to Prayers), Chapter 54, No. 662, p.375 (also Ibn Majah, Volume 4, Book 24 (Jihad), Chapter 39, No. 2860, p.196). Bukhari, Volume 1, Book 11 (Call to Prayers), Chapter 55, No. 664, p.376, says similarly.As stated earlier, Muhammad was a slave owner who had at least one African slave. (Bukhari, Volume 6, Book 60, Chapter 316, No. 435, p.407, Volume 9, Book 91 (Witnesses), Chapter 3, No. 368, p.275). Muhammad sold his African slaves to free another slave who converted to Islam. Ibn Majah, Volume 4, Book 24 (Jihad), Chapter 41, No. 2869, p.202. Following are excerpts.\"Then I dressed and went to the house of the Prophet of Allah, and behold, he was staying in an upper room where his African slave was (staying) on the first step.\" (Bukhari, Volume 6, Book 60, Chapter 316, No. 435, p.407)\"Umar narrated, 'I came and saw the Messenger of Allah living in the Mashroba (an attic room) and the African slave of the Messenger of Allah was on its steps.'\" (Bukhari, Volume 9, Book 91, Chapter 3, No. 368, p.275)This is interesting because Muhammad bought a slave who had converted to Islam (perhaps to free him.) Instead of paying the owner cash, Muhammad sold two of his African slaves. The ethnicity of the first slave is not mentioned, but for some reason, it was important to note that the two slaves Muhammad sold were African, and they had to be two to buy one.\"Jabir (Allah be pleased with him) reported that there came a slave and pledged allegiance to Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) for migration. He (the Prophet) did not know that he was a slave. Then there came his master and demanded him back, whereupon Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: 'Sell him to me.' And he bought him for two black slaves, and he did not afterward take the oath of allegiance from anyone until he had asked whether he was a slave (or a free man).\" (Ibn Majah, Volume 4, Book 24 (Jihad), Chapter 41, No. 2869, p.202)The Hadith of Bukhari can be found online at the websites:http://cwis.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/andwww.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/Comments for ChristiansAlthough you may feel very blessed that you do not need to believe and do these things, do not boast. If it were not for the grace of God, you could be ensnared in such a bondage that would make you think you need to do these things to please God. Your Sunni Muslim friends may not know much about their own books and may not understand these things. Show them and ask if they really want to participate in these things.God wants us to love Him; He wants our hearts and minds as well as our conduct and actions. He does not want us to believe in unsanitary remedies like using flies, or immoral acts with captives and slave girls. God wants us to follow what He has taught us in His Word, the Bible, and through Jesus, who was more than a prophet; Isaiah called Him Emmanuel (God with us).ShalomDr. Max Shimba for Max Shimba Ministries Org",

    "full_content": "Dear Reader,Since the establishment of Islam, Muslims worldwide have believed and taught that the angel called 'Gabriel' as mentioned in the Holy Bible is the same as the angel 'Jibril' as narrated in the Quran.An important question is whether the angel \"Gabriel\" is really \"Jibril\". I urge you to follow this lesson to find out the truth...REASONS MUSLIMS BELIEVE THAT ANGEL GABRIEL IS JIBRILMuslims compare verses from the Quran and the Bible and say that Angel Gabriel is Jibril. They read these verses:QURAN 19:16-17 SURAT MARYAM16. And mention Mary in the Book when she withdrew from her family to a place toward the east.17. And she took, in seclusion from them, a screen. Then We sent to her Our Spirit, and he represented himself to her as a well-proportioned man.LUKE 1:26-2826. In the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a city in Galilee named Nazareth,27. to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. The virgin's name was Mary.28. And he came to her and said, \"Greetings, O favored one, the Lord is with you!\"In addition to reading these verses, they also refer to the book on the life of Prophet Muhammad written by the former Chief Kadhi of Kenya, the late Sheikh Abdallah Saleh Al-Farsy, in which it states on page 17 section (A):HOW THE REVELATION WAS DELIVEREDMuslims believe that the Quran is the word of Allah, as well as the Torah of Prophet Musa, the Gospel of Prophet Isa, and the Psalms of Prophet Dawud. All are considered books containing the word of Allah. But Allah is unseen and not in any specific place. So how did these prophets receive these words? The answer is that they received them through the angel Jibril, the greatest of all Allah's angels.QURAN 53:2-6 SURATUL NAJM (THE STAR)2. Your companion [Muhammad] has not strayed, nor has he erred,3. Nor does he speak from [his own] inclination.4. It is not but a revelation revealed,5. Taught to him by one intense in strength -6. One of soundness. And he rose to [his] true form.By reading these verses, Muslims believe that Angel Gabriel is Jibril. However, these verses show a difference since the angel Jibril was sent by Allah, who is not Jehovah, to Mary, who was in the mosque, and the Quran does not mention the city or country where Jibril went. But we see the Bible teaching that the angel Gabriel entered Mary's house, and again, the Bible teaches that the revelation of prophecy was brought under the guidance of the Holy Spirit (2 Peter 1:20-21) and not by the angel Jibril as the Quran narrates.WHAT KIND OF BEINGS ARE ANGELS?HEBREWS 1:13-1413. To which of the angels did God ever say, \"Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet\"?14. Are not all angels ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation?It is clear that angels are spirit beings who can appear to people in human form, as seen in Genesis 18:1-19:12 when they visited Abraham and Lot. An angel appeared to Moses in the form of a burning bush that was not consumed (Exodus 3:1-5).ARE ALL ANGELS GOOD AND DO THEY NOT DISOBEY GOD?When we read the Quran, we see that Allah, who is worshipped by Muslims, describes angels as beings with the following attributes:QURAN 16:93 SURATUL AN-NAHL (THE BEE)Had Allah willed, He could have made you [all] one community [united in religion], but He sends astray whom He wills and guides whom He wills, and you will surely be questioned about what you used to do.QURAN 32:13 SURAT AS-SAJDAH (THE PROSTRATION)And if We had willed, We could have given every soul its guidance, but the word from Me will come into effect [that] \"I will surely fill Hell with jinn and men all together.\"EXPLANATION OF QURAN 32:13If Allah had willed, He could have created humans like angels who cannot do evil; their nature is only to do good. Therefore, they are not rewarded for their good deeds because they do not struggle to do them. But humans are created with the ability to do both good and evil equally, and they find pleasure more in doing evil.According to these verses, Allah, worshipped by Muslims, says that angels are good and cannot do evil and are one group that always obeys Allah. But when we refer to the Bible, we see our God Jehovah revealing to His prophets that angels are like this:2 PETER 2:4For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but sent them to hell, putting them in chains of darkness to be held for judgment.These fallen angels are under the devil, but apart from these fallen ones, there are also angels of this kind:MATTHEW 25:31When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his glorious throne.According to these verses, it is clear that our God teaches about two groups of angels, the good (holy) and the bad (fallen). This teaching, which Allah does not provide, since he says angels are only good, shows that Allah is not Jehovah.MEANING OF THE NAME GABRIELThe name \"Gabriel\" originates from the Hebrew language and means \"Messenger of God.\" In the Bible, the name Gabriel is mentioned four times (see Daniel 8:16, 9:21, Luke 1:19, and 1:26). Regarding Angel Gabriel, the Bible often shows that God sends him to bring good news concerning human salvation and to offer words of comfort to those he appears to by saying \"do not be afraid.\" In the Bible, the term \"Angel of the Lord\" is mentioned 65 times across 61 verses. If all these instances refer to Gabriel, then he is mentioned many times.HOW TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN GABRIEL AND JIBRIL1 TIMOTHY 4:1The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons.(See also Matthew 7:15-20)1 JOHN 4:1, 3, 15Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.But every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world.If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them and they in God.The important thing is to test whether Jibril or Gabriel acknowledges Jesus as the Son of God. If their teachings are the same, then they may not be two different angels but one. If they differ, they are two completely different angels.IS THE RANK OF ANGEL GABRIEL THE SAME AS JIBRIL?GABRIEL, THE ANGEL SENT BY JEHOVAH GOD, SAYS THIS:Luke 1:19 - The angel answered him, \"I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news.\"According to this verse, Angel Gabriel explains that he stands in the presence of God, thus his rank is a messenger who stands before God. Is the rank of Jibril, sent by Allah, the same as Gabriel's?QURAN 81:19-21 SURATUL AT-TAKWIR (THE FOLDING UP)19. Indeed, the Quran is a word conveyed by a noble messenger (Jibril)20. Who is possessed of power and with the Owner of the Throne, secure [in position],21. Obeyed there [in the heavens] and trustworthy.EXPLANATION OF QURAN 81:19-21The noble and obedient messenger in the heavens is \"Jibril,\" who is the \"Chief of all Angels.\"WHO IS THE CHIEF ANGEL OF JEHOVAH?JUDE 1:9But Michael the archangel, when he disputed with the devil and argued about the body of Moses, did not dare pronounce against him a railing judgment, but said, \"The Lord rebuke you!\"According to this verse, it is clear that the chief angel of Jehovah, whom we Christians worship, is Michael, while the chief angel of Allah, worshipped by Muslims, is Jibril. Therefore, Jibril is not Gabriel. Returning to the chief angel \"Michael,\" this name has Hebrew origins and means \"Who is like God.\" This is because he led the other angels in defeating Satan and expelling him from heaven when he exalted himself and wanted to be like God (See Revelation 12:7-12 and Daniel 10:13, 21; 12:2).THEIR TEACHINGS ABOUT THE SONSHIP OF GOD(A) GABRIEL, THE ANGEL OF JEHOVAH, TAUGHT THIS:LUKE 1:26-35(Quoting only verse 35)The angel answered her, \"The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore, the child to be born will be called holy—the Son of God.\"(B) JIBRIL, THE ANGEL OF ALLAH, SAYS THIS:QURAN 18:4-5 SURATUL AL-KAHF (THE CAVE)4. And to warn those who say, \"Allah has taken a son.\"5. They have no knowledge of it, nor do their forefathers. Grave is the word that comes out of their mouths; they speak not except a lie.These words taught by Jibril (QURAN 53:5-6) blaspheme our God Jehovah (See Exodus 4:22) where God says, \"Israel is My son, My firstborn,\" and His angel Gabriel taught the sonship of God.THEIR TEACHINGS ABOUT THE HOLY SPIRITLUKE 1:34-35(Gabriel says to Mary)34. Mary said to the angel, \"How will this be, since I am a virgin?\"35. The angel answered, \"The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore, the child to be born will be called holy—the Son of God.\"The Holy Spirit is God (Acts 5:3-4) and not an angel, hence the angel said He will come upon you.QURAN 16:102 SURATUL AN-NAHL (THE BEE)Say, \"The Holy Spirit has brought it down from your Lord in truth to make firm those who believe...\"QURAN 2:87 SURATUL AL-BAQARAH (THE COW)And We did certainly give Moses the Scripture and followed up after him with messengers. And We gave Jesus, the Son of Mary, clear proofs, and We supported him with the Holy Spirit.EXPLANATION OF QURAN 2:87For Muslims, the Holy Spirit is \"Angel Jibril\" and not the one Christians claim to be part of the Trinity. Here we see that Gabriel does not say he is the Holy Spirit anywhere, but Jibril claims he is the Holy Spirit—thus, Gabriel is not Jibril.DID ANGEL JIBRIL DELIVER PROPHECY TO THE JEWS?QURAN 2:97 SURATUL AL-BAQARAH (THE COW)Say, \"Whoever is an enemy to Jibril—it is [none but] he who has brought the Quran down upon your heart, [O Muhammad], by permission of Allah...\"EXPLANATION OF QURAN 2:97The Jews, in their schemes to reject Prophet Muhammad, asked him, \"Which angel brings you revelation?\" The Prophet said, \"Jibril.\" They said, \"Oh! HE IS OUR ENEMY, WE DO NOT WANT HIM. If another angel brought you revelation (i.e., inspiration), we would follow you.\" Jibril did not bring prophecy to the Jews; moreover, this angel Jibril teaches about the Jews like this:QURAN 5:82 SURATUL AL-MAIDAH (THE TABLE SPREAD)You will surely find the most intense of the people in animosity toward the believers [to be] the Jews and those who associate others with Allah.Here we see Jibril teaching Muslims that their greatest enemies are the Jews. Being an enemy of the Jews is being an enemy of salvation since Lord Jesus teaches us this...JOHN 4:19-22(Quoting only verse 22)You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews.Furthermore, all prophets are Jews, from Moses, David, Isaiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, Micah, Malachi, John the Baptist, and even Jesus.IS THE WAY ANGEL GABRIEL APPEARS TO PEOPLE THE SAME AS JIBRIL?(A) JIBRILQURAN 19:16-2616. And mention Mary in the Book when she withdrew from her family to a place toward the east.17. And she took, in seclusion from them, a screen. Then We sent to her Our Spirit, and he represented himself to her as a well-proportioned man.18. She said, \"Indeed, I seek refuge in the Most Merciful from you, [so leave me], if you should be fearing of Allah.\"19. He said, \"I am only the messenger of your Lord to give you [news of] a pure boy.\"20. She said, \"How can I have a boy while no man has touched me and I have not been unchaste?\"21. He said, \"Thus [it will be]; your Lord says, 'It is easy for Me, and We will make him a sign to the people and a mercy from Us. And it is a matter [already] decreed.'\"22. So she conceived him, and she withdrew with him to a remote place.23. And the pains of childbirth drove her to the trunk of a palm tree. She said, \"Oh, I wish I had died before this and was in oblivion, forgotten.\"24. But he called her from below her, \"Do not grieve; your Lord has provided beneath you a stream.25. And shake toward you the trunk of the palm tree; it will drop upon you ripe, fresh dates.26. So eat and drink and be contented...HOW JIBRIL ACTED WHEN HE APPEARED TO MUHAMMAD:One day—in the month of Ramadan, on the 17th, on a Monday in the 40th year and a half of his life—the Prophet saw a man standing before him without seeing where he came from. The man said to him, \"Read.\" The Prophet replied, \"I cannot read, for I have not learned to read.\" The man came closer, grabbed him, and said again, \"Read.\" The Prophet replied with the same answer. The third time the man said, \"Read—in the name of your Lord.\" He recited the beginning of Surah 96 until the middle. The Prophet then repeated it as it was recited to him. This was the first Surah revealed in the Quran, although it is not placed at the beginning. Suddenly, the man (angel) disappeared from his sight. The Prophet returned home, trembling with fear. When he reached home, Lady Khadija thought he had a fever, covered him with blankets, and sat by him, listening to his feverish murmuring. When the fever subsided, he narrated to Lady Khadija what had happened, and she comforted him and assured him that nothing bad would happen to him. Lady Khadija then went to her relative, Mr. Waraka bin Naufal, and told him everything that had happened to her husband. Mr. Waraka asked to see Muhammad, and the Prophet went and narrated his experience. Mr. Waraka said to him, \"That was Jibril who appeared to Prophet Musa and Prophet Isa. So be glad that you are the Prophet of this nation. I wish I could live to see you stand up to reform your people. InshaAllah, I will be your right-hand man.\" They returned home, and the fear left him.This account is found in the book \"The Life of Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W.)\" written by Sheikh Abdulla Saleh Farsy, who was the Chief Kadhi of Zanzibar and later the Chief Kadhi of Kenya, on pages 16-17.(B) HOW ANGEL GABRIEL APPEARED TO PEOPLE:LUKE 1:19Gabriel introduced himself by saying, \"I am Gabriel.\"DANIEL 8:15-16Or the person to whom he appeared was informed first.DANIEL 8:17-21LUKE 1:13, 30Gabriel reassures the person when they are afraid and says, \"Do not be afraid.\" Gabriel's nature is compassionate and gentle in informing the person, while Jibril of Allah grabs and squeezes people, causing Muhammad to experience fever. The question is, who is this Jibril?WHAT KIND OF BEINGS DOES ALLAH SEND?QURAN 19:83 SURATUL MARYAMDo you not see that We have sent the devils upon the disbelievers, inciting them to [evil] with [constant] incitement?QURAN 6:112 SURATUL AL-AN’AMAnd thus We have made for every prophet an enemy—devils from mankind and jinn, inspiring to one another decorated speech in delusion...Satan has the ability to transform into this form:2 CORINTHIANS 11:10-15(Quoting only verse 14)And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light.**Everyone who acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God remains in them and they in God (1 John 4:1-3, 15). Angel Gabriel acknowledged that Jesus is the Son of God, but Jibril did not acknowledge this (Luke 1:35; Quran 9:30). So, who is Jibril?WHAT IS THE FATE OF THE BEINGS ALLAH SENDS?Allah sends devils. The Holy Scriptures of the Bible teach us the fate of these beings as follows:MATTHEW 25:41(Jesus will command them)Then he will say to those on his left, \"Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.\"Dear beloved, I hope in our Lord Jesus Christ that you have come to clearly understand that Angel Gabriel of our God Jehovah is not the same as Jibril of Allah worshipped by Muslims.May the Lord bless you greatly as you spread this message to the nations so they may turn to the Lord Jesus and be saved.Amen!Today we have learned that Jibril in the Quran is not Gabriel in the Bible.Narrated by Max Shimba Ministries OrgDr. Max Shimba",

Follow along...KNOW THE FALSE PROPHETSBy Teacher Daniel MwankemwaINTRODUCTION:The issue of identifying false prophets has been a significant challenge for many people because these false prophets come claiming, \"We have been sent by Allah to deliver His message, and thus people must accept, believe, and follow it.\" When a prophet comes in this manner and meets people who cannot discern prophets and messengers based on God's Word, that is when deception occurs, and various groups of false beliefs emerge.Here in Tanzania, when you read the Constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania, Article 19 (i-iii), you will find explanations that a follower of any religion has the freedom to change their initial religion and join another religion they deem suitable for them. However, despite that freedom, not every religion (path) is suitable; some lead to eternal death.Proverbs 14:12 \"There is a way that appears to be right, but in the end it leads to death.\" (See also Proverbs 16:25).Among the individuals called prophets and messengers is a man named Muhammad s.a.w ibn Abdullah, ibn Abdu Muttalib, who is a prophet and messenger in the Islamic religion.You, the reader of this lesson, might wonder how we, who are not Muslims but Christians, begin to question the matters of Muhammad s.a.w, the prophet of Muslims. The answer is that the Quran, used by Muslims, mentions us Christians 62 times, urging us to accept, believe, and eventually follow Muhammad's message, claiming that he is the final prophet and messenger even to us Christians, sent by God.We read this in the Quran in Surah Al-Baqarah (The Cow), 2:62:\"Indeed, those who believed and those who were Jews or Christians or Sabeans - those [among them] who believed in Allah (as Muhammad says now) and the Last Day and did righteousness - will have their reward with their Lord, and no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve.\"For us as Christians, although we are mentioned in this verse, a question arises about Muhammad's prophethood and messengership: \"WHAT DID ALLAH FORGET IN HIS COMPLETE WORK OF REDEEMING HUMANITY FROM SIN THAT HE HAD TO SEND MUHAMMAD S.A.W?\"What is a prophet?A prophet is a person officially chosen by divine criteria to deliver God's message to people. In other words, a prophet is a spokesperson for God's mysteries.A prophet is a person who is a mouthpiece of God. He stands between God and humans, with the duty of delivering God's message to people. When a prophet is a spokesperson for God, he is inspired by the Holy Spirit, and his message is without error. The prophet restrains his own will, self, and thoughts when delivering God's prophetic message. Sometimes God Himself puts His words in their mouths (Deut 18:18, Jer 1:9). A prophet is a servant of God (Zech 1:6) and a messenger of God (2 Chron 36:15). Their prophecies are divided into three categories: prophecies concerning the fate of Israel, prophecies related to the coming of the Messiah, and eschatological prophecies (prophecies about future events). Therefore, the Law and the Prophets relate to the Pentateuch, i.e., Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. The prophets are all other books besides the Pentateuch.The book of the prophet Amos 3:7 \"Surely the Sovereign LORD does nothing without revealing his plan to his servants the prophets.\" The word prophet originates from the Hebrew language and means seer. 1 Sam 9:9 \"Formerly in Israel, if someone went to inquire of God, they would say, 'Come, let us go to the seer,' because the prophet of today used to be called a seer.\"This verse shows that true prophets of God must have their revelation or message originating from Allah Himself (the Holy Spirit), or dreams from Him, or visions from Him (Num 12:6), or through holy angels (Dan 8:15-21). Otherwise, they are false prophets.Warning from Lord Jesus:When Lord Jesus was here on earth, He warned us about recognizing false prophets and messengers before Muhammad was born (he was born in 570 AD), before Islam was established by Muhammad in 610 AD, and before the existence of a book called the Quran. We read these warnings from Lord Jesus in:Matthew 7:15-16 \"Watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves. By their fruit, you will recognize them.\"Matthew 24:11-13 \"And many false prophets will appear and deceive many people. Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold, but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved.\"The apostles of Lord Jesus emphasized and reinforced Jesus' warning about recognizing false prophets and apostles.1 John 4:1-3, 15 \"Dear friends, do not believe every spirit but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. This is how you can recognize the Spirit of God: Every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world. 15 If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them and they in God.\"These criteria given by the Holy Bible to identify false prophets and messengers are very important for us to examine in the lives of those who call themselves prophets or messengers.A true prophet receives revelation through the Holy Spirit:2 Peter 1:20-21 \"Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet’s own interpretation of things. For prophecy never had its origin in the human will, but prophets, though human, spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.\"1 Peter 1:10-11 \"Concerning this salvation, the prophets, who spoke of the grace that was to come to you, searched intently and with the greatest care, trying to find out the time and circumstances to which the Spirit of Christ in them was pointing when he predicted the sufferings of the Messiah and the glories that would follow.\"Revelation 19:10 \"At this, I fell at his feet to worship him. But he said to me, 'Don’t do that! I am a fellow servant with you and with your brothers and sisters who hold to the testimony of Jesus. Worship God! For it is the Spirit of prophecy who bears testimony to Jesus.'\"Thus, the prophets spoke within them being led by the Spirit of Christ Himself, even before He came to the world in the flesh. Is Muhammad s.a.w among them for us to believe his message?Muhammad did not know how to read or writeQuran 7:157\"Those who follow the Messenger, the unlettered prophet (who can neither read nor write) whom they find written in what they have of the Torah and the Gospel...\"Another evidence can be found in the book \"Life of Prophet Muhammad\" page 8 written by Sheikh Abdallah Saleh Al-Farsy. We read as follows in the learning segment:“There was no reading or writing in the Hijaz region, so the Prophet grew up like other Quraysh without knowing how to read or write. Their education was to learn matters concerning their Bedouin life, such as wars, composing poems to boast their bravery, and giving speeches that could stir people to fight without thinking.”Thus, Muhammad in his life did not know how to read or write, and that is how he lived his entire life.Did Jesus know how to read and write?Luke 4:16-17. Muslims claim in John 7:14 that people in Jerusalem were surprised by Jesus's knowledge, wondering how He learned without studying. The truth is that Jerusalem was not where Jesus grew up. He grew up in Nazareth, where people knew He could read, which is why He was given the scroll of the prophet Isaiah to read.How Muhammad (S.A.W) Received His Prophethood and RevelationThe revelation Muhammad received as the prophet of Muslims is very different from all the prophets before him mentioned in the Holy Bible. The difference is that all the prophets and apostles mentioned in the Holy Bible, written by various authors numbering about 40 over a long period, nearly 1500 years, have a unified revelation (it has conformity). The prophecies of the Old Testament are fulfilled in the New Testament. This is because the source of the revelation is one, the Holy Spirit.But for Muhammad s.a.w, the source of his revelation and eventually his prophethood is very controversial, and even followers of that religion do not know the exact truth.Let's briefly examine this controversy.When Muhammad s.a.w reached the age of 38, he moved from his home to caves near the city of Mecca. When he reached 40, one day, he encountered a being that Muslims today call the Angel Jibril.The revelation Muhammad received came with the sound of bells, a red face, and sweating. In Bukhari, Hadith 2, Volume 1, Al-Lu’lu Book 3, Page 874 Hadith 1505:“Hadith of Aisha r.a mother of the believers, said that Al Harith ibn Hisham r.a asked the Prophet of Allah s.a.w, 'O Messenger of Allah, how does the revelation come to you?' The Prophet of Allah s.a.w replied, 'Sometimes it comes like the ringing of a bell, and this is the hardest on me. When it leaves, I have understood what it said. Other times, the angel comes to me in the form of a man, and he speaks to me, and I grasp what he says.' Aisha r.a said, 'And indeed, I saw it coming upon him on a very cold day, and when it left, his forehead was dripping with sweat.'”Quran 53:2-6 Suratul Najm (The Star) \"Your companion [Muhammad] has not strayed, nor has he erred, nor does he speak from [his own] inclination. It is not but a revelation revealed, taught to him by one intense in strength - one of soundness.\"Muslims claim that this Angel Jibril is the same as the Holy Spirit who revealed the Quran to Muhammad. When we read the explanation of Surah 2:87 in the Quran, it says:\"For Muslims, the Holy Spirit is Angel Jibril, not the one Christians claim as part of the Trinity.\"One thing I want you to know is that all Muslims were not given knowledge about the Spirit. This includes their prophet Muhammad. We read this in Quran 3:7:\"He is the one who sent down to you the Book; in it, there are definite verses (clear in meaning) that are the essence of the Book, and others are allegorical. As for those in whose hearts is deviation, they follow the part of it which is allegorical, seeking discord and seeking an interpretation. And no one knows its interpretation except Allah. But those firm in knowledge say, 'We believe in it. All [of it] is from our Lord.' And no one will be reminded except those of understanding.\"Quran 17:85 Suratul Ban Israil (The Children of Israel):\"And they ask you about the soul. Say, 'The soul is of the affair of my Lord. And you have not been given of knowledge except a little.'\"Thus, in Islam, they lack the knowledge of the Spirit according to the Quran. This is why they often focus more on external matters than spiritual ones, such as washing and rinsing the nose with water, believing they have expelled Satan who was in the nose. In the book \"Al-Lu'lu' wal-Marjan,\" Volume 1, Hadith 183, Page 96, it reads:\"Narrated by Abu Huraira (r.a), the Prophet (s.a.w) said, 'When one of you wakes up from sleep, let him wash his nose by sniffing water and blowing it out three times because Satan spends the night in the upper part of his nose.' (Bukhari, Hadith No. 516, Volume 4)\"Having understood how Muslims lack the knowledge of the Spirit, we now question who this angel called Jibril is. Is he an angel of the true God YEHOVA?The Holy Bible explains about angels who rebelled in heaven and were cast down. 1 Peter 2:4 \"For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but sent them to hell, putting them in chains of darkness to be held for judgment;\"These teachings of the Bible show that there is a group of angels that rebelled and were cast out and are now awaiting judgment. This group today is called Satan, Jinn, or unclean spirits.But when we read the Quran, a book that came much later in the 7th century (610 AD), after the Bible, we get different information about angels.Quran 32:13 Suratul As-Sajdah (Prostration):\"If We had willed, We could have given every soul its guidance, but the word from Me will come into effect [that] 'I will surely fill Hell with jinn and men all together.'\"The explanation of this verse in the Quran reads:\"If Allah had willed, He would have created humans like angels who cannot do evil, their nature being to do only good; therefore, they would not be rewarded for their good deeds because they do them effortlessly. But humans are created capable of both, and their joy is more in doing evil.\"This verse and its explanation state that all angels of Muhammad's Allah are good; none has sinned, and among those angels, one appeared to Muhammad and gave him prophethood and the revelation of the Quran. Now let’s examine the cave where Muhammad was when he received his prophethood. We will be guided by Islamic religious books.In the book \"Life of Prophet Muhammad\" page 16-17 written by Sheikh Abdullah Saleh Al-Farsy, we read as follows:\"Then one day - in the month of Ramadan on the 17th, Monday in the year of his 40th ½ age - the Prophet saw a person standing before him without seeing where he came from. The person said to him, 'Read.' The Prophet replied, 'I do not know how to read for I have not learned to read.' The person came and held him, squeezed him, and said again, 'Read,' and the Prophet gave the same answer. For the third time, the person said, 'Read - Iqraa Bismi Rabbik.' He recited that part of Surah 96 to him. Then the Prophet read it as it was recited to him. This was the first Surah to be revealed in the Quran, although it was not placed at the beginning.Suddenly, that person (the Angel) disappeared from his sight - he could not see where he went. And the Prophet returned home, fear had gripped him. When he reached home, Lady Khadija thought he had a fever, covered him with clothes, and sat in front of him listening to him groan. When the fever subsided, he explained everything that had happened to Lady Khadija, and she comforted him, assuring him that nothing bad would happen to him. Immediately, she went to her relative - Mr. Waraqa bin Naufal - and gave him the full story. He instructed her to bring Muhammad to him. And the Prophet went and told him the whole story. Mr. Waraqa told him, 'That is Jibril who came to Prophet Musa and Prophet Isa. So be glad that you are the Prophet of this nation, and I wish I were alive to see you standing to reform your people; InshaAllah, I will be your right hand.' They returned home, and all the fear left him.\"He was played with by Satan in the cave:In the book titled \"Great Prophets and Their Wives\" written by Sheikh Abdullah Saleh Al-Farsy, page 12, we read:\"Then the Prophet was frightened and returned to his wife, told her the story, and immediately got a high fever, asking to be covered with clothes. Suddenly he began shaking and groaning, saying, 'I fear that Satan has played with me and driven me mad and deceived me.' Lady Khadija immediately replied, 'Stop that; it will not happen. You cannot be played with by demons. Satan cannot play with a person of your character. You take good care of your relatives, carry the burdens of even those who are not yours, and show people your good qualities that no one else has. You do this and that. Be glad, my brother. Calm your heart, by Allah! I see that you have become a prophet.\"In this incident that happened to Muhammad while in the cave, Muslims worldwide say that this is where Muhammad s.a.w received revelation and was given prophethood. But when you reflect on that message, you see that even he did not know what had happened to him in the cave. That is why we read that when he reached home, his wife, Lady Khadija, covered him with clothes thinking he had a fever. Muhammad told his wife what had happened, saying it was \"Satan,\" not mentioning any angel as Muslims want us to believe today. Because if it were an angel as we read in the Bible, he would not have hesitated to identify himself to Muhammad. This is the first point.The second pointis that we see a man named Waraqah ibn Naufal, the cousin of Muhammad's wife Lady Khadija. He tells Muhammad that the being that appeared to him was Angel Jibril. He then says, \"Be glad that you are the Prophet of this nation!\" Was he present in the cave when Muhammad was approached by an unknown being?The third pointis that even his wife, Lady Khadija, tells her husband about this prophethood. Was she in the cave? If not, who told her that it was Angel Jibril, given that Muhammad himself, who encountered the being, said he was approached by Satan? Reflect on this.In the book titled \"Tafsir Al-Kashif,\" by Muhammad Jawad Mughniyyah, page 74, paragraph 7, it reads:\"There is no way to know Iblis, Satan, and Jinn except through revelation (revelation).\"Quran Suratul Sad 38:69 Muhammad is quoted saying:\"I had no knowledge of the exalted assembly of angels...\"Because Muhammad s.a.w did not know angels, he says when you see a donkey bray, it has seen Satan. In the book \"The Truthful Trustworthy,\" Volume 3-4, Hadith 789, page 38, \"The Prophet (s.a.w) said, 'If a donkey brays, it has seen Satan.'\"This matter is different from how the Holy Bible explains about donkeys. God can even use a donkey to speak to humans to inform them of His message. In the book of Numbers 22:22-31, we read about Balaam and how God used a donkey to tell Balaam not to continue his journey after the donkey saw the angel of the Lord standing before them with a drawn sword blocking their way. The donkey spoke to Balaam in verse 30-31:\"The donkey said to Balaam, 'Am I not your own donkey, which you have always ridden, to this day? Have I been in the habit of doing this to you?' 'No,' he said. Then the LORD opened Balaam's eyes, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the road with his sword drawn. So he bowed low and fell facedown.\"It appears that in this incident with Balaam, God opened his eyes to see the angel. But for Muhammad, what he sees is Satan. That is why he says when a donkey brays, it has seen Satan.Therefore, if Muhammad's revelation begins with Satan as explained in the authentic Islamic books, according to the explanation in the book \"Tafsir Al-Kashif,\" it shows that Muhammad's revelation, prophethood, and even apostleship have a significant flaw compared to the message of the prophets and apostles mentioned in the Holy Bible.In the Bible, Satan is mentioned as being able to disguise himself as an angel of light.2 Corinthians 11:13-15 \"For such people are false apostles, deceitful workers, masquerading as apostles of Christ. And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light. It is not surprising, then, if his servants also masquerade as servants of righteousness. Their end will be what their actions deserve.\"When Muhammad was in Medina, he was asked by the Jews if his revelation came from the true God, by being asked to provide the characteristics of prophets. In response, Muhammad said:\"The Truthful Trustworthy,\" Volume 3-4, Page 63, Hadith No. 880:\"The Prophet (s.a.w) said, 'There are four qualities of the prophets: modesty, using perfume, marrying (wives), and using the tooth-stick.'\"These are not divine characteristics for a prophet and apostle but merely human ones.Prophets and various people in the Bible did not feel shame.Read Isaiah 50:7 \"Because the Sovereign LORD helps me, I will not be disgraced. Therefore, I have set my face like flint, and I know I will not be put to shame.\"Psalm 34:5 \"Those who look to him are radiant; their faces are never covered with shame.\"Psalm 119:46 \"I will speak of your statutes before kings and will not be put to shame.\"Romans 1:16 \"For I am not ashamed of the gospel because it is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes: first to the Jew, then to the Gentile.\"1 Peter 4:16 \"However, if you suffer as a Christian, do not be ashamed, but praise God that you bear that name.\"Moreover, we see that Muhammad was bewitched. Being bewitched is the state of being affected by dark powers, i.e., witchcraft. Can a prophet or messenger of the true God be bewitched?In Quran Suratul Ban-Israel, 17:47 \"We know very well why they listen when they listen to you, and when they conspire in secret, when the wrongdoers say, 'You follow none but a bewitched man.'\"Also, in Suratul Falaq, 113:1-5 \"Say, 'I seek refuge in the Lord of the dawn, from the evil of what He has created, and from the evil of darkness when it settles, and from the evil of those who blow on knots (those who practice witchcraft), and from the evil of an envier when he envies.'\"We read this incident in its explanation in the Quran, 8th edition, page 977, explaining Surahs 113-114:\"The impact of witchcraft on the Prophet (s.a.w). The second question that arises regarding these two surahs is that according to the hadith, witchcraft was performed against the Prophet (s.a.w) and he became ill, and to remove the impact of witchcraft, Jibril (a.s) came and gave him instructions to recite these two surahs. Many researchers, past and present, have opposed this matter, saying that if these hadith are accepted, then the entire system of sharia will be questionable because if the Prophet (s.a.w) could be affected by witchcraft and indeed showed its effects according to these hadith, then we cannot deny or dispute to what extent the enemies were able to make the Prophet (s.a.w) say and do things under the influence of witchcraft, and in his teachings, how much came from Allah and how much resulted from the impact of witchcraft on him. Not only that, but they also say these hadith contradict the Quran, as stated in the Quran, that the false claim of the disbelievers was that the Prophet (s.a.w) was bewitched, and he was affected by witchcraft: 'When the wrongdoers say, 'You follow none but a bewitched man.'' (17:47), but these hadith affirm the claims of the disbelievers that he was indeed affected and guided by witchcraft...According to the hadith narrated by Bukhari, Muslim, Nasai, Ibn Majah, Ahmad, 'Abdur Razzaq, Humaid, Baihaqi, Tabarani, Ibn Sa'd, Ibn Marduyah, Ibn Abi Shaibah, Hakim, Abd bin Humaid, and other Muhaddithin from Aisha (r.a), Zaid bin Arqam, Ibn 'Abbas through numerous chains of narration, it shows that the matter itself has reached the state of complete continuity, except that each hadith is a complete report.\"This is another substantial evidence showing that Muhammad's prophethood has issues. If Muslims themselves, according to these hadith, do not know how many of Muhammad's statements came from Allah and how many were influenced by sorcerers, can his revelation and prophethood be from the true God? Reflect on this!In the Holy Bible, there is no bewitchment of God's people.Numbers 23:23 \"There is no divination against Jacob, no evil omens against Israel. It will now be said of Jacob and of Israel, 'See what God has done!'\"According to the Holy Bible, true prophets and messengers of God come from the nation of Israel.The book of Ezekiel 13:9 \"My hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and utter lying divinations. They will not belong to the council of my people or be listed in the records of Israel, nor will they enter the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the Sovereign LORD.\"Also, according to the Quran, prophets and messengers must come from Jacob, who is the son of Isaac, who is the son of Abraham.Quran Suratul Al-Ankabut (The Spider), 29:27 \"And We gave [to him] Isaac and Jacob, and We placed in his descendants prophethood and [revelation of] the Book, and We gave him his reward in this world, and indeed, he is in the Hereafter among the righteous.\"This verse continues to emphasize that prophethood and the Book come through the descendants of Jacob. Unfortunately, Muhammad ibn Abdullah does not come from that lineage or even from Ishmael as Muslims claim. Because Ishmael is a Hebrew like his father, Abraham, who is also a Hebrew (Genesis 14:13), and Muhammad is an Arab from the Quraysh tribe. Recognizing this, we see Muhammad warning others to stay away from his tribe.Sahih Al-Bukhari Volume 1, Hadith No. 801, and Al-Lu'lu Book 3, Page 1089, Hadith No. 1846:\"The hadith of Abu Huraira (r.a) states, 'The Prophet of Allah (s.a.w) said, 'This Quraysh tribe will destroy people.' They asked, 'What do you advise us?' He said, 'I advise people to separate from it.'\"Dipping a fly in a drinkBukhari Volume 4 Hadith 537: \"Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet said: If a house fly falls into the drink of any one of you, he should dip it (in the drink) because one of its wings has a disease, and the other has the cure for the disease.\"The Apostles of Jesus in the Holy Bible warned us about such filth. In 2 Corinthians 7:1:\"Therefore, since we have these promises, dear friends, let us purify ourselves from everything that contaminates body and spirit, perfecting holiness out of reverence for God.\"Among the teachings of Muhammad is that there are ten things that complete Islam, and we read about them in the book \"The Truthful Trustworthy,\" written by Sheikh Said Moosa Al-Kindy of Muscat, Volume 3-4, Page 63, Hadith No. 880:\"The Prophet (s.a.w) said, 'There are ten things that complete Islam: trimming the mustache, letting the beard grow (not shaving it), using the tooth-stick, cleaning inside the nose with water, cutting the nails, washing the hands between the fingers, plucking (or shaving) the armpit hair, shaving the pubic hair, and conserving water. The tenth one, the narrator of the hadith said, I forgot, but he said it must be 'circumcision.'\"According to the Bible, prophets and messengers are confirmed through miracles.Exodus 14:21 \"Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and all that night the LORD drove the sea back with a strong east wind and turned it into dry land.\"Acts 19:11-12 \"God did extraordinary miracles through Paul so that even handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched him were taken to the sick, and their illnesses were cured, and the evil spirits left them.\" See also Acts 16:16-18, 20:7-12, and Acts 13:6-12.The Quran also confirms that prophets and messengers must perform miracles.Quran 40:78 Suratul Al-Mumin (The Believer):\"And We certainly sent messengers before you. Among them are those [whose stories] We have related to you, and among them are those [whose stories] We have not related to you. And it was not for any messenger to bring a sign except by permission of Allah.\"Muhammad was not given any miracle to confirm his claims of prophethood and messengership.Quran 29:50 Suratul Al-Ankabut (The Spider):\"And they say, 'Why are not signs sent down to him from his Lord?' Say, 'The signs are only with Allah, and I am only a clear warner.'\"In the Quran, there is a verse that we should all reflect on together. In Suratul An-Nisaa (Women), 4:79, \"Whatever of good reaches you is from Allah, but whatever of evil befalls you is from yourself. And We have sent you to the people as a messenger, and sufficient is Allah as a witness.\"This verse shows that Muhammad, the prophet of Muslims, was sent to people as a messenger, with Allah being just a witness. A witness is never the doer but merely the observer of the deed. Our question is, who are the people who sent Muhammad to the people? Because we saw earlier that after Muhammad left the cave, his wife Lady Khadija told him about the prophethood, and Mr. Waraqah ibn Naufal said to Muhammad, \"So be glad that you are the prophet of this nation\" before the Quran. Are these not the ones referred to as \"We have sent you\" mentioned in the verse above? Reflect on this!Muslims claim that Muhammad was sent by their Allah, who is the King of Kings. But when we read the Holy Bible in Revelation 17:14, \"They will wage war against the Lamb, but the Lamb will triumph over them because He is Lord of lords and King of kings—and with Him will be His called, chosen and faithful followers.\"In Revelation 19:11-16, \"I saw heaven standing open, and there before me was a white horse, whose rider is called Faithful and True. With justice, He judges and wages war. His eyes are like blazing fire, and on His head are many crowns. He has a name written on Him that no one knows but He Himself. He is dressed in a robe dipped in blood, and His name is the Word of God. The armies of heaven were following Him, riding on white horses and dressed in fine linen, white and clean. Coming out of His mouth is a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations. 'He will rule them with an iron scepter.' He treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God Almighty. On His robe and on His thigh, He has this name written: King of kings and Lord of lords.\"Jesus Christ is the King of kings and Lord of lords. But when we read the authentic Islamic hadith, they explain that the greatest enemy of Allah (s.w) the God whom Muslims worship is the one called the King of Kings.Sahih Al-Bukhari, Volume 8, Hadith No. 225, Al-Lu’lu wal-Marjan, Volume 3, Hadith No. 1385:\"The hadith of Abu Huraira (r.a) states, 'The Prophet of Allah (s.a.w) said, 'The most disgraceful and wicked name before Allah is a person calling himself Malikul-Amlak (King of Kings).'\"Therefore, the revelation Muhammad received, which he wants us Christians to believe, did not come from the God we believe in, Jesus Christ. Instead, according to the authentic Islamic books, it originated from being played with by Satan. Therefore, to us, he becomes a false prophet and messenger.The Holy Bible has warned us to test the apostles and prophets. In Revelation 2:1-2, \"To the angel of the church in Ephesus write: These are the words of him who holds the seven stars in his right hand and walks among the seven golden lampstands. I know your deeds, your hard work, and your perseverance. I know that you cannot tolerate wicked people, that you have tested those who claim to be apostles but are not, and have found them false.\"According to these verses, Muhammad s.a.w does not deserve to be called a prophet and messenger of the true God, but he falls into the category of false prophets and apostles. He is not suitable for us.Contact us for questions, comments, or to seek advice:Shalom,Max Shimba, a servant of Jesus Christ, the Almighty God. Titus 2:13",

    "full_content": "THE HOLY TRINITY ACCORDING TO THE BIBLEFirst of all, it should be understood that Almighty God is very exalted, and we, as His creatures, find it difficult to comprehend Him as we wish. God is omnipotent; we cannot limit Him by saying He can do this and that He cannot do that. We cannot fully comprehend God until He fits into our understanding; we cannot know His limits and boundaries. The day a human being can fully understand God, He will cease to be God.What we can understand is how He has revealed Himself to us through His Holy Scriptures. It would be strange to start denying how God wants us to understand Him through His Word. Therefore, it is my intention to present the Scriptures as God wants us to understand Him.The Bible teaches that God is One but in Three Eternal Personalities.In the Book of Genesis 1:1-3, we read:\"In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.\"We can say there is 1. God and 2. His Spirit. Then the scriptures continue to say:\"And God said, 'Let there be light,' and there was light\" (Genesis 1:3).So, we see that according to these scriptures, there is God, His Spirit, and His Word.These are living Personalities, each independently functioning according to God's will.There is ample evidence in the Scriptures showing that these Persons of God have been active throughout human history.For example, in Genesis 6:3, we read:\"Then the LORD said, 'My Spirit will not contend with humans forever…'.\" So, the Spirit of God can contend.Isaiah 44:3:“…I will pour out my Spirit on your offspring….”The Spirit of God, as a living Person, can be grieved or offended by humans.Matthew 12:31:\"And so I tell you, every kind of sin and slander can be forgiven, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.\"Ephesians 4:30:\"And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.\"The Holy Spirit preached the gospel in the Old Testament through the prophets.The prophets spoke the Word of God under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.1 Peter 1:11:\"They were told that their messages were not for themselves, but for you. And now this Good News has been announced to you by those who preached in the power of the Holy Spirit sent from heaven….\"2 Peter 1:21:\"For prophecy never had its origin in the human will, but prophets, though human, spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.\"In Romans 8:26, we see that:“…the Spirit himself intercedes for us through wordless groans.”All these attributes of the Spirit tell us that the Holy Spirit of God is the living Person of God's operation. In other words, the Holy Spirit is God Himself.Jesus Himself said:\"God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in truth\" (John 4:24).Who is the Word of God in the Bible?The Holy Scriptures (the Bible) tell us that God created the heavens and the earth by His Word. When you read Genesis 1:4-31, you will find that God spoke the Word of creation, and it came into being. Psalm 33:6 says:\"By the word of the LORD the heavens were made, their starry host by the breath of his mouth.\"When we carefully examine the scriptures, we discover that the Word of God is alive and powerful (read Hebrews 4:12) and has the power to give life. In this sense, we can conclude that, just as the Spirit of God is a living Personality, so is the Word of God.As we saw, the act of creation was carried out by the Word of God, the second Person of the Godhead. Throughout the Bible, there is evidence of this cooperation between God, His Word, and His Spirit in creation. The Word Himself says in Proverbs 8:22-30 about His participation in the work of creation:\"The LORD brought me forth as the first of his works, before his deeds of old; I was formed long ages ago, at the very beginning, when the world came to be…then I was constantly at his side. I was filled with delight day after day, rejoicing always in his presence.\"The Bible is very clear that this Word who created the heavens and the earth is also God. This is because you cannot separate God from His Word and say God is God and His Word is not God but something different. God and His Word are One. We read in John 1:1-3 that:\"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God…through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made.\"Throughout the Bible, we see the Word actively working and being given the attribute of a living Personality of God.Now the time comes to fulfill another great work of redeeming fallen humanity. As always in God's work, the principal actor is “His Word.” So, God sent His Word to complete the work of redemption.The Word became flesh to accomplish human redemption.God's principle regarding redemption is that:\"Without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness\" (Hebrews 9:22).Thus, we see that:“…since the children have flesh and blood, he too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might break the power of him who holds the power of death—that is, the devil” (Hebrews 2:14).Therefore, to redeem humanity:\"The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth\" (John 1:14).This act of the Word agreeing to become flesh is what led to Him being called the \"Son of God.\" As we saw in the above scripture, it is not in a physical sense as humans procreate. God Himself declared after the Word became flesh that:“You are my Son; today I have become your Father.” And again, “I will be his Father, and he will be my Son.” (Hebrews 1:5).\"And a voice from heaven said, 'This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased'\" (Matthew 3:17).By the Word becoming flesh, we then have the title of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. This is due to the fact that the act of the Word becoming flesh does not strip Him of His divinity. What we can see here is that the Word of God took on flesh, leading to a union of the Word (God) and flesh (Man). In Jesus, there is the fullness of God in His divinity and the fullness of humanity in His human body. The Word (Jesus) Himself says:\"...sacrifices and offerings you did not desire, but a body you prepared for me; with burnt offerings and sin offerings you were not pleased. Then I said, 'Here I am—it is written about me in the scroll—I have come to do your will, my God.'\" (Hebrews 10:5-7).We see that the Word was given a body, took on humanity, and we saw Him with all the attributes of humanity. But by His nature:“…being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness.” (Philippians 2:6-7).In this union, He was born of a woman, and the angel told Mary, who was to bear the Son, that:\"You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you are to call him Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High (that is, God)…The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So, the holy one to be born will be called the Son of God.\" (Luke 1:31-32, 35).Later, the angel Gabriel told Joseph, Mary's fiancé, the same words he told Mary:\"She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins\" (Matthew 1:21).What confuses many is when the Word became flesh and appeared in the form of a human. In that form, Jesus had all the human needs, such as hunger, thirst, sleep, circumcision on the eighth day, tears, fatigue, etc., like any other human being.We need to understand that Jesus came to show us how to live a victorious life against sin by relying on God as human beings. The scriptures testify that He was tempted as we are tempted, yet without sin. He had no blemish throughout His life. The Holy Scriptures say:\"But we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are—yet he did not sin\" (Hebrews 4:15).\"He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth\" (1 Peter 2:22).In His human state, He relied on God for everything. This is why you will see that He prayed to God the Father, and you will also see that He made statements like:\"...do not hold on to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them, 'I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God'\" (John 20:17).In the state of divinity that was within Him (the Word of God), He said statements such as:\"I and the Father are one\" (John 10:30).\"Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father\" (John 14:9).\"Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; or at least believe on the evidence of the works themselves\" (John 14:11).How was the Father in Jesus? By the Word that took on the human body; the Word of God was in the flesh, and the flesh was in the Word of God. That is Jesus.In this state, it is not surprising to call Jesus God, and indeed, He is not only God but:\"...Christ Jesus, our great God and Savior\" (Titus 2:13).Thus, the concept of the Holy Trinity (one God in three Persons) is very evident within the Holy Scriptures, and there is no need for much argument, except to deny the scriptures. As I said earlier, we humans should not dictate to God how He should be and how He should not be. What we can do is to receive by faith how He has revealed Himself to us and what He has shown us. The scriptures say:\"The secret things belong to the LORD our God, but the things revealed belong to us and to our children forever...\" (Deuteronomy 29:29).Up to this point, we have seen in the Bible that God is One but has revealed Himself to us in three Persons of His operation. In the Old Testament, these Persons are God, His Word, and His Spirit, and in the New Testament, after the Word became flesh, these Persons take on the title of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. Now let us turn to the Noble Quran and see if, 600 years later, God would change His revelations and teach otherwise.THE HOLY TRINITY ACCORDING TO THE NOBLE QURANSince in examining the Holy Trinity in the Bible, we started from the beginning during creation, we must follow the same approach for this subject.The Holy Spirit according to the Noble Quran.Just as in the Bible, the Noble Quran agrees that God created the heavens and the earth in six days.\"It is He who created the heavens and the earth in six days—and His Throne was upon the water—that He might test you as to which of you is best in deed. But if you were to say, 'You are indeed to be raised up after death,' those who disbelieve would surely say, 'This is not but obvious magic'\" (Surah 11:7, HUD).Abdalla Farsy, a Swahili commentator of the Quran, explains in his commentary on this verse:“And saying that the heavens and the earth were created in six days, God knows Himself, what exactly those six days are according to His own calculation. And that Throne of God we do not know nor do we know about the WATER upon which the Throne was” (Abdalla Farsy, Tafsiri ya Quran Tukufu, Surah 11:7).It appears that the interpreters of the Quran fail to understand these words about God's creation. But they should not struggle; what they need to do is follow the advice given within the Noble Quran itself. In Surah 10:94, we read:\"So if you are in doubt about what We have revealed to you, then ask those who have been reading the Scripture before you (the Jews and the Christians)\" (Surah 10:94).To understand those days of creation and how the Throne of God was upon the water at that time of creation, one needs to read the Bible as we saw earlier. The Bible states that the days consist of \"evening and morning,\" making up a day (read Genesis 1). Morning and evening can only occur within a 24-hour period. Thus, those six days are days of 24 hours each. The Bible also says:\"For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but He rested on the seventh day. Therefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy\" (Exodus 20:11).\"Thus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array. By the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing; so on the seventh day he rested from all his work\" (Genesis 2:1-2).The Quran also agrees with the Bible that God was upon the water during creation. According to the Bible, it was the Spirit of God that was hovering over the surface of the waters (Genesis 1:2).Many verses in the Quran show that the Spirit of God is sent from God to strengthen His servants (Prophets), for example:\"He sends down the angels with the Spirit by His command upon whom He wills of His servants, (saying), 'Warn that there is no deity except Me; so fear Me'\" (Surah 16:2, An-Nahl).\"Exalted above (all) degrees, (He is) the Possessor of the Throne. He places the Spirit of His command upon whom He wills of His servants to warn of the Day of Meeting\" (Surah 40:15, Al-Mu'min).Many Quranic commentators like Abdalla Farsy interpret the word “spirit” (rooh) used in these verses of the Quran to mean Revelation or Message or Prophethood that God gives to His prophets. This verse of Surah 40:15 in Abdalla Farsy's commentary reads:\"He is the Exalted in ranks, the Possessor of the Throne. He sends down the Revelation of His command upon whom He wills of His servants to warn of the Day of Meeting\" (Abdalla Farsy, Tafsiri ya Quran Tukufu, Surah 40:15).Here, the Arabic word \"rooh\" (spirit) is interpreted as \"wahyi\" (revelation). Perhaps to avoid the direct understanding that God sends His Holy Spirit to the prophets and messengers to give the warning messages. However, this still agrees with the concept we saw in the Bible that prophets delivered their messages under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.\"For prophecy never had its origin in the human will, but prophets, though human, spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit\" (2 Peter 1:21).Jesus Himself, after becoming flesh (in His humanity), both the Bible and the Quran testify that He was strengthened by the power of the Holy Spirit to perform many miracles.\"And We gave Moses the Book and followed him up with a succession of messengers. And We gave Jesus, the son of Mary, clear proofs and supported him with the Holy Spirit. But is it (not) that every time a messenger came to you (Israelites) with what your souls did not desire, you were arrogant? And a party (of messengers) you denied and another party you killed\" (Surah 2:87, Al-Baqara).\"When Allah will say, 'O Jesus, son of Mary, remember My favor upon you and upon your mother when I supported you with the Pure Spirit and you spoke to the people in the cradle and in maturity; and when I taught you writing and wisdom and the Torah and the Gospel; and when you designed from clay (what was) like the form of a bird with My permission, then you breathed into it, and it became a bird with My permission; and you healed the blind and the leper with My permission; and when you brought forth the dead with My permission; and when I restrained the Children of Israel from (killing) you when you came to them with clear proofs, and those who disbelieved among them said, 'This is nothing but obvious magic'\" (Surah 5:110, Al-Ma'ida).These words are also found in the Bible, that Jesus was empowered by the Holy Spirit. Jesus said:\"The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to set the oppressed free\" (Luke 4:18).The lack of detailed explanations about the Holy Spirit and His work in the Quran does not mean that there is no Person of God called the Holy Spirit. This absence might be because the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) himself was revealed to:\"And they ask you, (O Muhammad), about the Spirit. Say, 'The Spirit is of the affair of my Lord. And mankind has not been given of knowledge except a little'\" (Surah 17:85, Al-Israa).According to this verse, Allah (SWT) says that Muhammad was given only a little knowledge about the matters concerning the Holy Spirit. However, even this little knowledge, when read in the light of the Holy Bible, we can see the consistent chain of teaching about the Holy Spirit.After seeing the presence of the Holy Spirit from God within the Noble Quran, let us now look at the \"Word of God\" and His work within the Quran.The Word from Almighty God according to the Noble QuranIn the Bible, we saw that the Word of God created the heavens and the earth. Is there any difference in the Quran? No, we read in Surah 2:117:\"The Originator of the heavens and the earth. When He decrees a matter, He only says to it, 'Be,' and it is\" (Surah 2:117, Al-Baqara).These words completely align with the words in the Holy Bible that:\"By the word of the LORD the heavens were made, their starry host by the breath of his mouth ... For he spoke, and it came to be; he commanded, and it stood firm\" (Psalm 33:6,9).Thus, we see that both the Bible and the Quran agree that the heavens and the earth were created by the Word of God. In the Bible, we saw that this Word became flesh and lived among us. Can we find evidence in the Quran that the Word became flesh?The Word that became flesh according to the Noble QuranIn Surah 3:45, we read:\"(Remember) when the angels said, 'O Mary, indeed Allah gives you good tidings of a word from Him, whose name will be the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, distinguished in this world and the Hereafter and among those brought near (to Allah).\"In this verse, we are told that Prophet Jesus (Isa) is a Word from God, and He has honor in this world and the Hereafter. As He Himself said in Matthew 28:19, \"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.\"Throughout the Quran, Prophet Jesus (Isa) is described as the Word from God.Why then do Muslims deny the divinity of Jesus or the Holy Trinity, despite the abundant evidence within the Quran?To be truthful, there are no scriptures within the Quran that directly deny that Jesus or Prophet Isa is not God, or that reject the concept of the Holy Trinity, i.e., One God in three Persons (note that when the Quran says that God is One, it does not mean denying the Holy Trinity. The Bible also teaches that God is One, but this oneness is in three Persons as we saw in this study).Many explanations within the Quranic interpretations that deny the divinity of Jesus are enhanced by the explanations or teachings of the interpreters of the Quran. It is evident that these explanations by the interpreters contradict the Quran itself.Here, I will provide an example of a verse within the Quran that is often used to deny the divinity of Jesus or the Holy Trinity. I will present four (4) Swahili translations of this verse to show how Islamic scholars struggle to conceal the divinity of Jesus. The verse is Surah 4:171.Translation by Aliy Muhsin Barwaani (Sunni):\"O People of the Scripture! Do not commit excess in your religion or say about Allah except the truth. The Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, was but a Messenger of Allah and His Word which He directed to Mary and a soul (created at a command) from Him. So believe in Allah and His messengers. And do not say, 'Three'; desist—it is better for you. Indeed, Allah is but one God. Exalted is He above having a son. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And sufficient is Allah as Disposer of affairs.\"The Holy Quran (Along with Translation and Commentary in Swahili) (Ahmadiyya):(O here it is made verse 172)\"O People of the Scripture! Do not exceed the limits in your religion, nor say about Allah except the truth. The Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, was but a Messenger of Allah and His Word which He directed to Mary and a soul (created at a command) from Him. So believe in Allah and His messengers. And do not say, 'Three'; desist—it is better for you: for Allah is only one God. Far exalted is He above having a son. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth. And Allah is sufficient as a Disposer of affairs.\"Translation by Ali bin Jumaa bin Mayunga (Shia):\"O People of the Scripture! Do not exceed the limits in your religion, nor say about Allah except the truth. The Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, was but a Messenger of Allah and His Word which He directed to Mary and a soul (created at a command) from Him. So believe in Allah and His messengers. And do not say, 'Three'; desist—it is better for you. Indeed, Allah is only one God. Exalted is He above having a son. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth, and Allah is sufficient as a Disposer of affairs.\"Translation by Abdallah Farsy (Sunni):\"O People of the Scripture! Do not exceed the limits in your religion, nor say about Allah except the truth. The Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, was but a Messenger of Allah and (a creature created by) His command (of Allah) which He directed to Mary, and a soul (created at a command) from Him (Allah like any other soul). So believe in Allah and His messengers. And do not say, 'Three'; desist (from that belief); it will be better for you. For Allah is only one God. Exalted is He above having a son. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth, and Allah is sufficient as a Disposer of affairs.\"Analysis of These Translations:I have brought this verse in different translations of the Quran to illustrate the intended meaning of this verse. When you carefully read the translation by Sheikh Balwaniy, you will find that this verse informs us of three attributes of Prophet Jesus (Isa), namely:Prophet Jesus is a Messenger of Allah (meaning he was sent by God).Prophet Jesus is the Word from Allah directed to Mary.Prophet Jesus is a soul from Allah.The attribute of being sent by God the Father.The attribute that Jesus is the Word from God the Father.The attribute that Jesus is the Spirit of God.These three attributes of Jesus are not denied by the Holy Bible as follows:\"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him\" (John 3:16-17).\"The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth\" (John 1:14).\"God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in truth\" (John 4:24).It is impossible to separate God from His Spirit and His Word. If God is Spirit, then it is correct to say that the Word is also Spirit.All three translations of the Quran I presented here—Sheikh Balwaniy, Ahmadiyya, and Mayunga—agree in the explanation of this verse. These three translators have translated word for word from Arabic in this Surah 4:171. Now let's also examine the translation of Sheikh Abdallah Farsy.\"O People of the Scripture! Do not exceed the limits in your religion, nor say about Allah except the truth. The Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, was but a Messenger of Allah and (a creature created by) His command (of Allah) which He directed to Mary, and a soul (created at a command) from Him (Allah like any other soul). So believe in Allah and His messengers. And do not say, 'Three'; desist (from that belief); it will be better for you. For Allah is only one God. Exalted is He above having a son. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth, and Allah is sufficient as a Disposer of affairs.\"At first glance, when you analyze this translation, you will find that Sheikh Abdallah Farsy plays a word game. All the words he placed in parentheses ( ) are his additions to guide the reader to understand what he wants it to be. You will find that this translation is intentionally made to protect the Islamic belief that Allah is one, He neither begets nor is He begotten.\"(Saying: 'He is Allah, [who is] One. Allah, the Eternal Refuge. He neither begets nor is born, nor is there to Him any equivalent')\" (Surah 112:1-4, Al-Ikhlas).This Surah is the most important Surah in the Quran for Muslims. It seems that from childhood, they are required to memorize this Surah. The first pillar in Islam is the Shahada, which is to testify that \"There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is His Messenger.\"It seems that the entire Islamic system is built on denying the concept of the Holy Trinity.Unfortunately, Muslims oppose this without having a thorough understanding of this concept of the Holy Trinity. Sometimes they have created a belief that does not even exist among Christians themselves and implanted it in their followers, making Christians appear as they are not, i.e., that Christians believe in three gods.As we have seen in this study, this belief is entirely contrary to Christianity; Christians do not believe in three gods, and this teaching is not from the Bible, but Christians believe in one God who exists in Three Living Persons, and this is what we call the HOLY TRINITY.Let's return to the translation of Abdallah Farsy. Let's look at these words he placed in parentheses ( ).\"The Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, was but a Messenger of Allah and (a creature created by) His command (of Allah) which He directed to Mary.\"Abdallah Farsy here is creating his own sentence by mixing the words of the Noble Quran to call them the Words of Allah. These words mean something completely different from the words of the Quran, which are:\"The Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, was but a Messenger of Allah and His Word which He directed to Mary, and a soul from Him.\"He continues to add his words to distort the translation by saying:\"And a soul from Him (Allah like any other soul).\"Abdallah Farsy wants us to understand here that there are other souls that have come from Allah, so it is not surprising for Prophet Isa. In other words, this Sheikh wants to teach us that God has a “store” or warehouse of human souls which He releases and implants in humans. These words he placed in parentheses are not in the Arabic language in that verse, which is why you will find that the Sheikhs who translated word for word did not include those words.As in the Bible, the word itself, the Holy Trinity, does not appear in the entire Quran, but by carefully examining the Bible and the Quran, we can see that this concept of the Holy Trinity is a teaching of the Holy Books. Both books agree that there is One Unique God who has no partner in all His works, and He exists in Three Living Persons of His operation: God, the Word of God, and the Holy Spirit of God. When it came time to redeem humanity, the Word became flesh, and thus we receive the titles of these Three Persons of God, namely, God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit.Shalom,Dr. Max Shimba",

There is no intercessor except after His permission. That is Allah, your Lord, so worship Him. Then will you not remember?\"However, dear brothers and sisters, upon further examination of the Quran, I discovered that Allah lied when He said that He created the earth in six days. Now join me in examining the creation of the earth as it is more clearly explained in the Quran, which was revealed by Jibril.Now we will readSurah 41:9-12. In these verses, you will discover that Allah did not create the earth in six days as He initially claimed.THE CONTRADICTION BEGINS HERE:THIS VERSE SAYS ALLAH CREATED IN TWO DAYS (2)Quran 41:9: \"Say, 'Do you indeed disbelieve in He who created the earth in two days and attribute to Him equals? That is the Lord of the worlds.'\"[ADD]HERE ALLAH JOINS THE CLOUDS AND EARTH IN FOUR DAYS (4)Quran 41:10: \"And He placed on the earth firmly set mountains over its surface, and He blessed it and determined therein its [creatures'] sustenance in four days without distinction – for [the information] of those who ask.\"[ADD]HERE ALLAH CREATES THE HEAVENS IN TWO DAYS (2)Quran 41:12: \"And He completed them as seven heavens within two days and inspired in each heaven its command. And We adorned the nearest heaven with lamps [i.e., stars] and as protection. That is the determination of the Exalted in Might, the Knowing.\"ALL THESE TOGETHER TOTAL EIGHT DAYS (8)Two days for the creation of the earth, then four days to fill the earth with mountains, blessings, and sustenance for its inhabitants, and finally two more days to create the seven heavens and their stars. This adds up to 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 days, contrary to the six days mentioned in other verses.LET ME SUMMARIZE BRIEFLY:The structure is very clear: These are three levels of creation from bottom to top:Quran 41:9: The heavens [sky, \"roof\" above the earth] in two days---------- ADDQuran 41:10: BLESSINGS [filling the earth with everything needed for life] in four days--------- ADDQuran 41:12: EARTH [foundation] completed in two daysDear brothers and sisters, did Allah fail at mathematics, or is this confirming that He was not the Creator?Today, Allah has once again assured us that He is not the Creator. The choice is yours: to follow Allah, who does not know how many days it took to create the earth, or Yahweh, who said He created the earth in six days.ShalomDr. Max Shimba for Max Shimba Ministries Org",

Its verses lack logical flow. Each verse stands on its own and does not relate to the preceding or following verse.In one verse, Allah commands his followers to strike non-Muslims, while in another, he commands them to forgive.

Are these claims true?In several Surahs, the Quran confuses Mary, the mother of Isa [Miriam in Hebrew], with Miriam, the sister of Aaron and Moses, and the daughter of Amram, who lived about 1600 years earlier.Finally, she (Mary) brought him (the baby) to her people, carrying him. They said, \"O Mary! Indeed, you have brought a thing unprecedented. O sister of Aaron, your father was not a man of evil, nor was your mother unchaste.\"-- Surah 19:27-28And Mary, daughter of Imran...-- Surah 66:12I understand what Muslims claim to be the solution to this problem. Yusuf Ali, for example, writes in his footnote 2481, explaining the above verse: “Aaron, the brother of Moses, was the first in the line of Israelite priests. 'Sisters of Aaron' or 'daughters of Imran (who was the father of Aaron).'”This is a misconception. Only Aaron was made a priest of the Lord and indeed the first High Priest. Only Aaron's descendants became priests. Neither Moses nor their sister Miriam are ever understood to be in the \"priestly line.\" Amram is certainly not a priest. If Mary's lineage as part of the priestly family was to be emphasized, she must be called the daughter of Aaron since all the priests of Israel are descendants of Aaron, while his siblings are not counted among the priestly line.I acknowledge that the terms \"father,\" \"daughter,\" and \"sister\" can sometimes be used loosely to indicate a general family relationship. Therefore, we must carefully read each mention to see what it means. The Quran makes it clear that the specific, physical meaning of daughter and (therefore) sister is intended in this matter, as I will show below. Even if there was no concern about the issue of \"priesthood\" and a broader family relationship was viewed, why does the Quran not say \"daughter of Aaron,\" who is more famous? Although the term \"sister\" can be used more broadly than a sister in a close family, isn't it standard usage even in Islam that \"brothers and sisters\" live in nearly the same generation (like cousins) while \"father and daughter\" indicate a generational difference between the two? Why call her the sister of the famous Aaron (1400 years older than Mary) instead of the daughter of `Imran (Biblically Amram), whose only mention is in genealogical tables in Exodus 6 and 1 Chronicles 23? This seems clear that the two Miriams were indeed confused. But attempts to harmonize seem not very logical.The above points are only some of the \"smaller questions.\" The larger problem is that the Quran clearly does not speak of a broad genealogical relationship as we see in the following verse.Remember! The wife of Imran said: \"O my Lord! I dedicate to You what is in my womb for Your service... When she delivered, she said: \"O my Lord! I have delivered a female child!\" \"... And I have named her Mary...\"-- Surah 3:35-36Muslims are generally very precise about who is the wife of whom, and it is certainly not allowed that anyone can just make love to a woman because she is \"more his sister.\" If Mary is a female child from the womb of the wife of `Imran, then she is directly the daughter of Imran and there is no doubt that the theory of a \"distant lineage\" is contradicted by the Quran itself.Yusuf Ali in his footnote 375 to Surah 3:35 even goes further by concocting (?) a second Imran by claiming that “by tradition, Mary's mother was called Hanna... and her father was called Imran,” to somehow save the Quran from this conflict. But the same tradition that names Mary's mother as Hanna also names her father as Joachim. Why does Yusuf Ali accept one part of this tradition (e.g., in the Proto-Evangelion of James the Less) and reject another?Yusuf Ali provides no reference for this \"tradition\" he refers to. Until I see any reference for this, there is no reason to accept this theory. To my current knowledge, there was no such tradition preceding Muhammad. Some Islamic commentators may have created something later to explain this very issue, but a late theory/\"tradition\" is not very reliable.And a final question:Is there any other instance in the Quran where someone is repeatedly called the daughter [son] or sister [brother] of people who are more distant relatives?Even if there were one such name in the lineage that was so strong that everyone is referred to in relation to that one person, it is doubly unlikely that anyone would be called in relation to two distant relatives instead of \"father\" and \"brother,\" and never mentioned in relation to their actual parents or siblings. If this is the only instance, then the explanations of Muslims become more difficult since emergency explanations, i.e., explanations that have no purpose other than to explain this one problem but are not used elsewhere, are not very reliable. It appears like a makeshift argument in this case. And the fact that Aaron is the son of Imran and this is a direct and correct genealogical relationship also shows that all others are understood as daughter and sister in the usual, everyday meaning.Thomas Patrick Hughes in his book \"A Dictionary of Islam,\" page 328, writes on this issue that \"it certainly is the cause of some perplexity for commentators. Al-Baidawi says she was called `sister of Aaron' because she was of the tribe of Levi; but Husein says that the Aaron mentioned in the verse is not the same person as the brother of Moses.\"As usual, conflicting explanations are evidence that there is indeed a problem in the Quran and no clear and satisfactory solution is found.Note: Moses and Aaron are called \"Moses ibnImran\" and \"Aaron ibnImran\" in the Hadith, just as Mary is called \"Maryam ibnat `Imran\" in Surah 66:12.Shalom,Dr. Max Shimba for Max Shimba Ministries",

Indeed, Muhammad had many enemies.How was he killed?There are many possible ways: some could have used poison, others a knife, a club, or pushing him off a cliff, etc.What is interesting is that the Quran tells us how Allah would have killed Muhammad.Quran 69:44-46And if he (Muhammad) had forged a false saying concerning us,We surely would have seized him by his right hand,Then We would certainly have cut off his life artery (Aorta).Let's see some interpretations of this verse as translated by various scholars.Quran 69:44-46If he (Muhammad) had forged a false saying concerning us, We would surely have seized him by his right hand (or with power and might), and then certainly should have cut off his life artery (Aorta). (Hilal-Khan)And if (Muhammad) had invented lies against Us, We would certainly have seized him by the right hand, then We would certainly have cut off his life artery. (Pickthall)Had he invented lies concerning Us, we would have seized him by the right hand and severed his heart's vein. (Dawood)If he had fabricated against Us, some of the sayings, We should certainly have seized him by the right hand, then We would certainly have cut off his Aorta. (Shakir)All these interpretations mean the same thing.Therefore, according to the Quran, if Muhammad had fabricated revelations, Allah would have killed him by cutting his life artery (Aorta).Now let's see what the Hadith says about Muhammad being poisoned by a Jewish woman.Sahih Al-Bukhari 2617A Jewess brought a poisoned (cooked) sheep for the prophet who ate from it. She was brought to the Prophet and was asked, \"Shall we kill her?\" He said, \"No\". Anas added: \"I continued to see the effect of the poison on the palate of Allah's Messenger.\"Translation:A Jewish woman brought poisoned cooked meat to the Prophet, who ate from it. She was brought to the Prophet and questioned, \"Shall we kill her?\" The Prophet said, \"No\". Anas added, \"I continued to see the effect of the poison on the palate of Allah's Messenger.\"Sahih Muslim 5430A Jewess came to Allah's Messenger with poisoned mutton, and he took of what had been brought to him. (When the effect of this poison was felt by him), he called for her and asked her about that, whereupon she said: \"I had determined to kill you.\" Thereupon he said: \"Allah will never give you the power to do it.\"Translation:A Jewish woman came to Allah's Messenger with poisoned mutton, and he took what was brought to him. (When he felt the effect of this poison), he called for her and asked her, whereupon she said: \"I had determined to kill you.\" Thereupon he said: \"Allah will never give you the power to do it.\"You see? Muhammad confidently tells the woman that Allah will not allow her to kill him, but unfortunately, the poison killed him. Why did the woman want to kill Muhammad?The answer to this question is found in the Hadith of Ibn Sa'd, Volume 2, pp. 251-252The Apostle of Allah sent for Zaynab bint Al-Harith and said to her: \"What induced you to do what you have done?\" She replied: \"You have done to my people what you have done. You have killed my father, my uncle, and my husband, so I said to myself, if you are a prophet, the foreleg will inform you; and others have said: if you are a king, we will get rid of you.\"The Prophet of God sent for Zaynab bint Al-Harith and said to her, \"What made you do what you did?\" She replied, \"You have done to my people what you have done. You killed my father, my uncle, and my husband, so I said to myself, if you are a prophet, the foreleg will inform you; and others have said, if you are a king, we will get rid of you.\"Ibn Sa'd, Volume 2, pp. 251-252So you see, the woman killed Muhammad because he had killed her family. However, Zaynab was not alone in this; she had a partner in the plot.Sahih Al-Bukhari 4428The Prophet in his ailment in which he died, used to say, \"O Aisha! I still feel the pain caused by the food I ate at Khaibar, and at this time, I feel as if my aorta is being cut from that poison.\"Translation:The Prophet, in his ailment in which he died, used to say, \"O Aisha! I still feel the pain caused by the food I ate at Khaibar, and at this time, I feel as if my aorta is being cut from that poison.\"Sunan Abu Dawud 4498A Jewess presented (Muhammad) at Khaibar with a roasted sheep which she had poisoned. The Apostle of Allah ate of it, and the people also ate. He then said: \"Lift your hands (from eating), for it has informed me that it is poisoned.\" Bishr al-Bara b. Ma'rur al-Ansari died. So he (the Prophet) sent for the Jewess (and said to her): \"What motivated you to do the work you have done?\" She said: \"If you were a prophet, it would not harm you; but if you were a king, I would rid the people of you.\" The Apostle of Allah then ordered regarding her, and she was killed. He then said about the pain of which he died: \"I continued to feel pain from the morsel which I had eaten at Khaibar. This is the time when it has cut off my aorta.\"Translation:A Jewish woman presented poisoned roasted sheep to Muhammad at Khaibar. The Apostle of Allah ate from it, and the people also ate. He then said: \"Lift your hands (from eating), for it has informed me that it is poisoned.\" Bishr al-Bara b. Ma'rur al-Ansari died. So he (the Prophet) sent for the Jewess and asked her, \"What motivated you to do the work you have done?\" She said: \"If you were a prophet, it would not harm you; but if you were a king, I would rid the people of you.\" The Apostle of Allah then ordered her to be killed. He then said about the pain from which he died: \"I continued to feel pain from the morsel I had eaten at Khaibar. This is the time when it has cut off my aorta.\"You start to get the picture here. Did anyone in the Quran say they would cut Muhammad's main artery?Quran 69:44-46And if he (Muhammad) had forged a false saying concerning us,We surely would have seized him by his right hand,Then We would certainly have cut off his life artery (Aorta).You see? You can connect the dots here.We have also seen one of Muhammad's companions, Bishr b. Al-Bara b. Ma'rur al-Ansar, dying after eating the poison.But before he died, he told Muhammad that as soon as he put the piece of meat in his mouth, he felt the poison, but he continued to eat because he saw the Messenger of Allah, Muhammad, eating.Ibn Sa'd, Volume 2, pp. 252-252The Apostle of Allah, may Allah bless him, took the foreleg, a piece of which he put into his mouth. Bishr ibn al-Bara took another bone and put it into his mouth. When the Apostle of Allah, may Allah bless him, ate one morsel of it, Bishr ate his, and other people also ate from it. Then the Apostle of Allah, may Allah bless him, said: \"Hold back your hands! Because this foreleg; and according to another version, the shoulder of the goat, has informed me that it is poisoned.\" Thereupon Bishr said: \"By Him who hath made you great! I discovered it from the morsel I took. Nothing prevented me from emitting it out, but the idea that I did not like to make your food unappetizing. When you had eaten what was in your mouth, I did not like to save my life after yours, and I also thought you would not have eaten it if there was something wrong.\" Bishr did not rise from his seat but his color changed to that of Taylsan (a green cloth).The Apostle of Allah, may Allah bless him, took the foreleg, a piece of which he put into his mouth. Bishr ibn al-Bara took another bone and put it into his mouth. When the Apostle of Allah, may Allah bless him, ate one morsel of it, Bishr ate his, and other people also ate from it. Then the Apostle of Allah, may Allah bless him, said: \"Hold back your hands! Because this foreleg; and according to another version, the shoulder of the goat, has informed me that it is poisoned.\" Thereupon Bishr said: \"By Him who hath made you great!

When you had eaten what was in your mouth, I did not like to save my life after yours, and I also thought you would not have eaten it if there was something wrong.\" Bishr did not rise from his seat but his color changed to that of Taylsan (a green cloth).Ibn Sa'd, Volume 2, pp. 251-252So Bishr died because he trusted Muhammad, believing him to be a prophet and thinking he would detect the poison.Muhammad explained his pain to Bishr's mother.Sahih Abu Dawud 4449Umm Bishr said to the Prophet during the illness of which he died: \"What do you think about your illness, Apostle of Allah? I do not think about the illness of my son except the poisoned sheep of which he had eaten with you at Khaibar.\" The Prophet said: \"And I do not think about my illness except that. This is the time when it has cut off my aorta.\"Translation:Umm Bishr said to the Prophet during the illness of which he died: \"What do you think about your illness, Apostle of Allah? I do not think about the illness of my son except the poisoned sheep of which he had eaten with you at Khaibar.\" The Prophet said: \"And I do not think about my illness except that. This is the time when it has cut off my aorta.\"At-Tabari, Volume 8, p. 124The messenger of God said during the illness from which he died—the mother of Bishr b. Al-Bara had come to visit him—\"Umm Bishr, at this very moment I feel my aorta being severed because of the food I ate with your son at Khaibar.\"The messenger of God said during the illness from which he died—the mother of Bishr b. Al-Bara had come to visit him—\"Umm Bishr, at this very moment I feel my aorta being severed because of the food I ate with your son at Khaibar.\"At-Tabari, Volume 8, p. 124According to his wife Aisha, Muhammad was in severe pain before his death.Sunan Ibn Majah 1622Aisha said: \"I never saw anyone suffer more pain than the messenger of Allah.\"Translation:Aisha said: \"I never saw anyone suffer more pain than the Messenger of Allah.\"Sunan Ibn Majah 1622Sahih Al-Bukhari 2588Aisha said: \"When the Prophet became sick and his condition became serious, he requested his wives to allow him to be treated in my house, and they allowed him. He came out leaning on two men while his feet were dragging on the ground.\"Translation:Aisha said: \"When the Prophet became sick and his condition became serious, he requested his wives to allow him to be treated in my house, and they allowed him. He came out leaning on two men while his feet were dragging on the ground.\"Sahih Al-Bukhari 2588Now, since the Quran says that if Muhammad had been a false prophet, Allah would cut his main artery, and Muhammad admitted that his main artery (Aorta) was cut, we can conclude that Muhammad was not a true prophet.You might also wonder about Muhammad's judgment in accepting food from someone whose relatives he had killed.If Muhammad did not have the common sense to avoid food from someone whose family members he had killed, can he be trusted in anything he says?Moreover, Zaynab tested Muhammad, believing that if he was a true prophet, he would not die from the poison, but if he was a false prophet, he would die. Muhammad failed this test.Additionally, Muhammad's friend Bishr tasted the meat and realized it was poisoned but continued to eat because he saw Muhammad eating and trusted him.Lastly, when the Jews tried to kill Jesus, Allah intervened and saved him.Quran 4:157-158And for saying, \"We killed the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, the messenger of Allah.\" But they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him; but [another] was made to resemble him to them. And indeed, those who differ over it are in doubt about it. They have no knowledge of it except the following of assumption. And they did not kill him, for certain.Rather, Allah raised him to Himself. And ever is Allah Exalted in Might and Wise.It's remarkable that Allah saved Jesus from the Jews but allowed Muhammad to be killed by a single Jewish woman.In conclusion, Muhammad wanted to die as a martyr in battle but died from poison given by a woman.Sahih Bukhari 2797\"By Him in Whose Hands my life is! I would love to be martyred in Allah's cause and then be resurrected and then be martyred, and then be resurrected again and then be martyred, and then be resurrected again and then be martyred.\"Translation:\"By Him in Whose Hands my life is! I would love to be martyred in Allah's cause and then be resurrected and then be martyred, and then be resurrected again and then be martyred, and then be resurrected again and then be martyred.\"Sahih Bukhari 2797Unfortunately, Muhammad died from poison given by a woman.Remember, Muhammad received revelations from Allah whenever he needed them, whether it was meeting Aisha, marrying four wives, or marrying his adopted son's wife. Allah always fulfilled Muhammad's desires.Here, I am laying the foundation by looking at the surrounding details in the Quran. Later, I will start revealing the hidden teachings within the Quran. This journey will be long and requires great patience.I am not engaging in religious debates but trying to show you how Muhammad died and who killed him.Unlike what your religious leaders tell you to control your thoughts, this is about freeing your mind if you receive it with an open heart.ShaloomDr. Max Shimba for Max Shimba Ministries Org",

Invite people to the Way of Truth that your Lord has called your people to follow. And in your invitation, use the approach that suits each of them. Call those with high ranks among them with words of wisdom according to their understanding. And for the rest of the common people among them, call them by giving them relevant admonitions and using examples of the matters they deal with, guiding them to the Truth, and lead them on the straightforward path that suits them. And argue with the people of the previous religions, i.e., Jews and Christians, using intellectual arguments, logic, and gentle words, and good discussions, not harsh words and insults, to persuade and attract them. This is the way of Da'wah (invitation), calling people to approach Allah—people of all faiths. So follow this path when you call, and after that, leave the rest to your Lord, who knows who among them is deeply immersed in misguidance and far from the path of salvation, and who among them is safe, has been guided, and believes in what you have brought to them.ALLAH SAYS THAT CHRISTIANITY IS A PRECEDING RELIGION. SO ISLAM DID NOT EXIST BEFORE CHRISTIANITY.http://www.iium.edu.my/deed/quran/swahili/without/c16.htmIS IT TRUE THAT CHRISTIANITY AND THE CHURCH EXISTED BEFORE ISLAM?Let's read about Moses. Did he enter a CHURCH?Acts 7:37 This is the Moses who told the Israelites, ‘God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your own people.’38 He was in the assembly in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and with our ancestors; and he received living words to pass on to us.Moses answers Muslims by stating that he was in the Church when he was in the wilderness. Thus, Moses was not a Muslim, nor did he ever enter a Mosque.Shalom,Dr. Max Shimba for Max Shimba Ministries Org.",

These statements have deeply hurt Christians, especially when they are asked to provide a verse from the Bible that says Christianity is a religion.My dear friends, today I would like to address this weak and unfounded accusation against Christianity and the false claim that God has a religion.WHAT IS THE ORIGIN OF THE WORD CHRISTIANITY?The word Christianity derives from the name \"Christ.\" Therefore, a Christian is a follower of Christ. It's like saying a Tanzanian comes from Tanzania or the term Tanzanian derives from the union of \"U\" and \"Tanzania.\"The goal of a Christian is to seek close fellowship with God. This fellowship is made possible by the work of Jesus and the presence of the Holy Spirit in a Christian's life.The Holy God has no fellowship with sin and does not have a religion. Between Him and man, there is a great divide of sin. Man tries to reach God through many ways: RELIGION, good deeds, prayer, etc., but these are all insufficient. Man remains sinful.WHAT DOES CHRISTIANITY MEAN?Christianity is a unique faith compared to others because it focuses more on fellowship with God rather than religious acts. Contrary to adhering to a list of dos and don'ts, the goal of a Christian is to seek a close relationship with God the Father.Christians believe that the Bible is the Word of God and its teachings are the final authority (2 Timothy 3:16, 2 Peter 1:20-21). Christians believe in one God existing in the Trinity: the Father, the Son (Jesus Christ), and the Holy Spirit.WHAT DOES RELIGION MEAN?Religion is man's attempt to have a relationship with a Holy God despite being sinful. The Christian faith is a relationship with God because of what He has done for us through the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.CHRISTIANITY IS NOT A RELIGION BUT A UNIQUE FAITH THAT FOCUSES MORE ON FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD THAN RELIGIOUS ACTS THAT CANNOT LEAD TO HEAVEN.There is only one way to fellowship with God.JESUS CHRIST IS THE ONLY WAY TO REMOVE SIN.He died for us so that we may know God's love and plan for our lives.WHAT IS TRUE FAITH?True faith is not about focusing on laws but on principles. True faith is a relationship with God. Two things that all religions acknowledge are that man, in some way, is separated from God and needs to be reconciled with Him.False religions seek to solve this problem by keeping laws or rules. True faith solves the problem by recognizing that only God can fix the separation, and He already has. True faith recognizes the following:• All have sinned and are separated from God (Romans 3:23).• If not remedied, the just penalty for sin is death and eternal separation from God after death (Romans 6:23).• God came to us through Jesus Christ, died for us, took the penalty we deserved, and rose from the dead to prove that His death was a sufficient sacrifice (Romans 5:8; 1 Corinthians 15:3-4; 2 Corinthians 5:21).• If we receive Jesus as our Savior, believing His death as the full payment for our sins, we are forgiven, saved, redeemed, reconciled, and made righteous with God (John 3:16; Romans 10:9-10; Ephesians 2:8-9).Therefore, while other religions require their followers to perform or abstain from certain acts, Christianity is about having fellowship with God.Thus, Christianity is the followership of Christ, who is God. Jesus Christ is God.Max Shimba MinistriesCopyright © Max Shimba Ministries 2015",

This is another disaster for Muslims.How many names does Allah have, 99 or 100?NOW LET'S READ ABOUT THE GOD OF THE BIBLE:The God known asExodus 6:2-3,And God spoke to Moses and said to him, \"I am the LORD;And I appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as God Almighty, but by My name LORD I was not known to them.Do you see the difference between Allah and Jehovah in the Bible? Jehovah doesn't beat around the bush like Allah, who says He has beautiful names but fails to prove that JEHOVAH is His name.God said to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob 2668 years before Muhammad that His name is JEHOVAH, BUT ALLAH never said in the Quran that Jehovah is His name. THEREFORE ALLAH IS NOT THE GOD OF ABRAHAM, ISAAC, AND JACOB.Now, between the Almighty God who said in the Torah 2668 years before Muhammad that His name is JEHOVAH, AND Allah who failed to prove that He is Jehovah beyond saying He has beautiful names, whom should we believe?Remember, in the Old Testament alone, the NAME Jehovah is mentioned 6800 times, while in the Quran the name JEHOVAH is NOT mentioned even once.ALLAH CLAIMS THAT THE QURAN CONFIRMS THE TORAH, THE GOSPEL, AND THE PSALMS. ISN'T IT?LET'S READ THAT VERSE FIRST.Surah Al-Baqara 89. And when there came to them a Book from Allah confirming that which was with them — although before they used to pray for victory against those who disbelieved — but [then] when there came to them that which they recognized, they disbelieved in it; so the curse of Allah will be upon the disbelievers.Read more testimonies:Surah Al-Ma'ida 48. And We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad], the Book in truth, confirming that which preceded it of the Scripture and as a criterion over it. So judge between them by what Allah has revealed and do not follow their inclinations away from what has come to you of the truth. To each of you We prescribed a law and a method. Had Allah willed, He would have made you one nation [united in religion], but [He intended] to test you in what He has given you; so race to [all that is] good. To Allah is your return all together, and He will [then] inform you concerning that over which you used to differ.NOW, IF IT IS TRUE THAT THE QURAN CONFIRMS THE TORAH, PSALMS, AND GOSPEL,Why is there no Name Jehovah in the Quran?Why did Allah not say He is Jehovah to Muhammad?Why did Muhammad not ask Allah about this name Jehovah mentioned in the Torah, Psalms, and Gospel?Prove that Allah is a name with evidence from the verses. Thus, Allah has 100 names and not 99.Dear reader, it is very easy to catch Allah in His lie, because He claimed that the Quran confirms the Torah, Psalms, and Gospel, YET HE FAILED to prove that He is JEHOVAH.Therefore, Allah is not Jehovah, and the Quran does not confirm the Torah, Psalms, and Gospel.Based on the evidence above, I can say that ALLAH IS NOT GOD, ALLAH IS NOT JEHOVAH, MUHAMMAD IS A FALSE PROPHET, AND THE QURAN IS A FALSE BOOK FILLED WITH DOUBTS.If any Muslim disputes, then prove the following:Show me the Name Jehovah in the Quran.Show me the Name Yahuh in the Quran.Bring me a verse where Allah confirms that He is Jehovah, as He claimed that the Quran confirms the Torah, Psalms, and Gospel in Surah Al-Ma'ida 48.Prove that Allah is a name with evidence from the verses. Thus, Allah has 100 names and not 99.It is I, Max Shimba, a Servant of Jesus Christ the Almighty God.",

So whoever must swear should swear by Allah or be silent.\"Now let's read about Allah, who is not Jehovah \"Yahweh\", who does He swear by?Quran 91:1-7 Suratul Ash-Shams (The Sun)By the sun and its brightness. And [by] the moon when it follows it. And [by] the day when it displays it. And [by] the night when it covers it. And [by] the sky and He who constructed it. And [by] the earth and He who spread it. And [by] the soul and He who proportioned it.Quran 92:1-3 Suratul Al-Layl (The Night)By the night when it covers. And [by] the day when it appears. And [by] He who created the male and female.Here we see that Allah, worshipped by Muslims, swears by the sky and the one who built it, by the earth and the one who spread it.Who is the Spreader of the earth and the Builder of the sky?For Allah of Islam, swears by Him. Your answer is, God Jehovah created male and female, God Jehovah created Heaven and Earth, but Allah swears by the Creator of Heaven and Earth and by the Creator of male and female. Allah swears by Jehovah, the God of Christians.Who created male and female?QURAN 92:1-3By the night when it covers, 2 and by the day when it appears, 3. and by He who created the male and female...When someone swears by another, is he a god or a human?Who created them then? Because Allah swears by the Creator, and creating is a characteristic of God. So Allah did not create.Who is this Creator of male and female whom Allah of Islam swears by?Continue reading... from the Holy Bible…Jeremiah 27:5 I have made the earth, the man and the beasts that are upon the ground, by my great power and by my outstretched arm; and I give them unto whom it seems meet unto me.Now we read about Jehovah, the God of the Bible, that He is the one who created everything, including male and female whom Allah of Islam swears by. Therefore, Jehovah created male and female, and Allah of Islam swears by Him, so you yourself fill in who is God?Can God swear by another? Keep getting knowledge…Hebrews 6:13 When God made his promise to Abraham, since there was no one greater for him to swear by, he swore by himself,Jehovah says there is no one greater than Himself to swear by, but Allah in the Quran says that He swears by the one who created male and female.So today we understand that the Creator is Jehovah and Allah swears by Jehovah, the God of the Bible and Christians.God bless you abundantlyMax Shimba MinistriesCopyright © Max Shimba Ministries 2013",

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteWednesday, January 12, 2022Introduction: The Claim ExaminedMuslim apologists frequently argue that the Bible prophesies or references the city of Mecca, asserting that “Baca” in Psalm 84:6 is a cryptic mention of Mecca, called “Bakkah” in the Qur’an (Surah 3:96). At first glance, the similarity in the two names seems striking—but a careful, honest reading of the biblical and Qur’anic texts exposes this as amisguided and unsustainable claim.The Biblical Context of “Baca”Let us look directly at the relevant passage:“Blessed are those whose strength is in you,who have set their hearts on pilgrimage.As they pass through the Valley of Baca,they make it a place of springs;the autumn rains also cover it with pools.”(Psalm 84:5-6, NIV)This passage describes pilgrims journeying to thesanctuary of the Lord—a context steeped in Jerusalem Temple worship, not an Arabian setting. The entire psalm radiates a longing for thedwelling place of Yahweh, repeatedly referencing “your house,” “your altar,” and “Zion” (Jerusalem), not Mecca or the Ka‘bah.Contradictory DetailsLet us weigh the evidence:God’s Dwelling Place:The sanctuary in Psalm 84 is where God’s presence is said to dwell (v.1, v.4). Nowhere in Islamic doctrine is Allah believed to literally “dwell” in the Ka‘bah; this concept is utterly foreign to Islamic theology, which strictly rejects all forms of anthropomorphism. By contrast, the Old Testament consistently presents the Temple in Jerusalem as the locus of God’s special presence among His people (1 Kings 8:10-13, 27).The Altar:Psalm 84 mentions drawing near to the altar (v.3). There is no altar in Mecca’s Ka‘bah as part of any sacrificial system, but the altar is central to both tabernacle and temple worship in ancient Israel (Exodus 27:1-8). The Qur’an never describes Bakkah as a place of sacrifice or an altar to Yahweh.Inhabitants and Roles:The psalmist blesses those who “dwell in your house” (v.4)—a reference to the priests and Levites residing within the temple precincts. The Ka‘bah is empty, uninhabited, and guarded, not lived in or managed by priests with biblical duties. There were doorkeepers for the Temple (2 Kings 25:18); no such official role exists for the Ka‘bah in Islamic tradition.Destination: Zion, Not Mecca:The pilgrimage in Psalm 84 has a clear destination:Zion, one of Jerusalem’s hills and a synonym for the city itself (v.7). It is geographically, historically, and theologically nonsensical to suggest the pilgrims of Israel would make a detour through Arabia on their way to Jerusalem!Hebrew vs. Arabic Terms:While Hebrew “Baca” (בכא) and Arabic “Bakkah” (بكة) sound similar, this is a superficial connection. The root of “Baca” is linked to weeping (“the Valley of Weeping”) or to balsam trees common to dry places, not to a specific city. The word for “pilgrimage” in Psalm 84:5 is not “hag” (Hebrew חג), related to festival, but from a root meaning “highway” or “path,” simply denoting the journey to Jerusalem.The Valley of Baca: Real or Figurative?Whether Baca refers to a literal valley near Jerusalem or is a poetic expression for hardship and sorrow, its purpose is clear:it marks a stage on the route to Jerusalem.Some Jewish sources place it north of the city. Nowhere in the Bible is there any implication that Baca is remotely connected with Mecca, which is over 1,000 kilometers to the south and across the Sinai wilderness. Nor does the biblical narrative allow for such an implausible detour.The Error of Superficial SimilarityThe attempt to equate “Baca” with “Bakkah” relies only on a similarity of sound, not on substantive historical, geographical, or theological data. Many locations in the Ancient Near East bear similar names (e.g., Wadi al-Baka in Sinai, a valley called Baca in Galilee), yet no one claims these are Mecca.Why the Confusion?The primary reason for such claims is the effort toretrofit Islamic revelation into biblical prophecy—a recurring theme among some Islamic polemicists. The motive is clear: if Islam can claim biblical roots, its status as a true continuation of Abrahamic faith is bolstered. But this effort here iscontradicted by the biblical evidence itself.Conclusion: The Claims Do Not StandA close, honest reading shows thatBaca of the Bible is not the Bakkah of the Qur’an. The biblical psalm speaks of Israelite pilgrims journeying to Jerusalem’s Temple, not of any pre-Islamic sanctuary in Arabia. Attempts to conflate the two areunsupported by scripture, history, or theology.In fact, such efforts demonstrate the dangers of forcing a text to fit a predetermined theory, rather than letting the text speak on its own terms.Let fair-minded seekers of truth see this as a cautionary example. The Christian and Jewish scriptures do not mention or anticipate Mecca as a place of pilgrimage—neither in Psalm 84 nor anywhere else.Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

This peculiar sign is explicitly recorded in one of the authentic Hadith collections.Hadith of Abu Huraira (may Allah be pleased with him):The Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) said:\"The Hour will not be established until the buttocks of the women of the tribe of Daus move while going around Dhi-al-Khalasa.\"Explanation:Dhi-al-Khalasawas an idol that the Daus tribe used to worship during the pre-Islamic period of ignorance (Jahiliyya). This idol was a central object of idolatrous rituals, and it is noted in the Hadith that one of the signs preceding the establishment of the Last Day (Qiyamah) would be the women of this tribe moving their buttocks around this very idol.Source:Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 9, Book 88, Hadith Number 232.Arabic Text of the Hadith:حديث أبي هريرة رضي الله عنه أن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم قال:\"لن تقوم الساعة حتى تضطرب أليات نساء دوس حول ذي الخلصة\"Translation of the Arabic Text:Narrated Abu Huraira (may Allah be pleased with him): The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said:\"The Hour will not be established until the buttocks of the women of the tribe of Daus move while going around Dhi-al-Khalasa.\"Reference:Sahih Bukhari — Volume 9, Book 88, Hadith 232Concluding Note:This narration reflects one of the unusual eschatological signs described in early Islamic literature concerning the Day of Judgment. The mention of such an occurrence reveals the cultural and religious context of 7th-century Arabia, where certain pre-Islamic idols and tribal practices remained significant symbols even in prophetic warnings. From a comparative theological perspective, it underscores the unique character of some Islamic eschatological traditions when juxtaposed with those of other Abrahamic faiths.Shalom,Max Shimba Ministries Org",

    "full_content": "A Critical and Scholarly Examination of a Major Qur’anic ContradictionBy Dr. Max Shimba | Max Shimba MinistriesIntroductionThursday, December 2, 2021This article presents a scholarly examination of a theological and historical issue arising in the Qur'an—namely, the claim that there was a flood during the time of Prophet Moses. According to the Bible, there was no such event recorded as part of the ten plagues in Egypt. This analysis draws upon Qur’anic verses, classical tafsir (commentaries), and the biblical record to highlight a contradiction that carries theological significance.1.Flood in the Days of NoahThe Qur’an clearly attributes a global flood to the time of Prophet Noah, as seen in the following verses:“Indeed, We sent Noah to his people, and he dwelt among them for a thousand years minus fifty. Then the flood overtook them while they were wrongdoers.” (Surah 29:14, Arberry)“But they denied him, so We saved him and those with him in the Ark, and We drowned those who rejected Our signs. Indeed, they were blind people.” (Surah 7:64, Arberry)“So they denied him, and We saved him and those with him in the Ark, and made them successors, and drowned those who denied Our signs. So see what was the end of those who were warned.” (Surah 10:73, Arberry)These verses unmistakably affirm the flood during Noah’s time.2.Alleged Flood During the Time of MosesHowever, the Qur’an appears to suggest that another flood occurred during Moses' confrontation with Pharaoh:“So We sent upon them the flood, the locusts, the lice, the frogs, and the blood as clear signs, but they were arrogant and were a criminal people…” (Surah 7:133, Arberry)“So We took retribution from them and drowned them in the sea because they denied Our signs and were heedless of them.” (Surah 7:136, Arberry)“And We brought the Children of Israel across the sea, and Pharaoh and his hosts followed them in arrogance and enmity, until drowning overtook him…” (Surah 10:90–92, Arberry; cf. Yusuf Ali version)The Yusuf Ali translation emphasizes Pharaoh dying in a “flood,” implying more than just a parting of the Red Sea. This interpretation creates confusion when read alongside biblical accounts.3.Contradiction with the Biblical RecordThe Bible, in the Book of Exodus, documents ten distinct plagues sent by God upon Egypt for Pharaoh's refusal to release the Israelites. These are:Water turned to blood (Ex. 7:20)Frogs (Ex. 8:6)Lice (Ex. 8:17)Swarms of flies (Ex. 8:24)Death of livestock (Ex. 9:6)Boils (Ex. 9:10)Hailstorm (Ex. 9:23)Locusts (Ex. 10:14)Darkness (Ex. 10:22)Death of the firstborn (Ex. 12:29)Nowhere is a “flood” mentioned as one of the ten plagues. The drowning of Pharaoh and his army occurs at the Red Sea during the Exodus but not as a flood judgment over the land of Egypt.4.Qur’anic Exegetical Evidence: Classical TafsirClassical Islamic commentators confirm the presence of a flood in the story of Moses:Ibn Kathir on Surah 7:133:“Ibn Abbas said it was heavy rain that destroyed the crops and fruits... Mujahid said it refers to water that carried plague and death across the land... The land was covered with water, so they begged Moses to pray for them...”Al-Tabari:“Then Allah sent the flood upon them... Everything they had was submerged...”Ibn Ishaq (through Ibn Humayd and Salamah):“Allah sent him with signs... He sent the flood, then locusts, then vermin, then frogs, and finally blood... The flood submerged the land’s surface, then withdrew...”Ibn Abbas (Tanwîr al-Miqbâs):“(We sent upon them) unceasing rain from Saturday to Saturday...”Al-Jalalayn:“We sent upon them a flood of water that entered their homes and reached their necks for seven days...”This extensive traditional evidence affirms that the Qur’anic commentators understood “Tufan” (flood) to mean literal flooding during Moses’ time.5.A Further Inconsistency: Nine Signs Instead of TenThe Qur’an also claims that Moses was sent withninesigns:“And We gave Moses nine clear signs. Ask the Children of Israel when he came to them...” (Surah 17:101, Arberry)This contradicts the well-documented ten plagues in the Torah. Even Qur’anic exegesis attempts to reconcile this by listing the signs:Ibn Abbas (Tafsir on 17:101):“The hand, the staff, the flood, locusts, lice, frogs, blood, years of famine, and loss of wealth.”Al-Jalalayn:“The hand, the staff, the flood, locusts, lice, frogs, blood, loss of wealth, and years of scarcity...”The omission of the death of the firstborn—arguably the most severe of the plagues—is noteworthy and further highlights the inconsistency.6.ConclusionThe Qur'an presents an anachronistic and historically inaccurate claim that a flood occurred in Egypt during the time of Moses as one of the plagues. This is at odds with both the Biblical record and historical understanding. The confusion likely stems from a conflation of the Noahic flood and the Exodus narrative.As noted by Christian apologist Abdallah Abd al-Fadi:“There was no flood in Egypt during the Exodus. This confusion is likely due to a misplacement of the global flood of Noah into Moses' timeline.”(Does the Qur'an Have Errors?Nuru ya Maisha, p. 88–89)Thus, this is yet another example where the Qur'an appears to contradict previous divine revelations and historically accurate accounts.Shalom,Dr. Max ShimbaMax Shimba Ministries",

    "full_content": "Tuesday, November 30, 2021The Twenty Versions of the Qur'an: A Critical ExaminationBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteMax Shimba Ministries Org.IntroductionIn this study, I intend to present factual evidence regarding the existence of multiple versions of the Qur'an, a topic that has long been suppressed within Islamic circles. Contrary to the widely held belief that there exists only one Qur'an, historical sources and Islamic hadith literature record the existence oftwenty different versionsof the Qur'an. Among these, seven have been explicitly acknowledged in the most trusted hadith collections attributed to the Prophet Muhammad.This paper will outline the twenty known versions, their respective transmitters (Qurrā’), and raise critical theological and historical questions that challenge the claims of a singular, unchanged Qur'anic text.The Seven Primary Qur’anic Readers (Qurrā’) and Their VersionsIslamic tradition acknowledges seven principal Qur'anic readers, each of whom is said to have transmitted the Qur'an with two distinct narrations (versions). These readings, orQirā’āt, have been historically accepted as authoritative, though variations exist among them in pronunciation, word choices, and occasionally meaning.The seven primary readers and their two versions each are as follows:Nāfiʿ(from Medina; d. 169 AH / 785 CE)WarshQālūnIbn Kathīr(from Mecca; d. 119 AH / 737 CE)Al-BazziQunbulAbū ʿAmr al-ʿAlāʾ(from Damascus; d. 154 AH / 770 CE)Al-DūrīAl-SūrīIbn ʿĀmir(from Basra; d. 118 AH / 736 CE)HishāmIbn DhakwānḤamzah(from Kufah; d. 156 AH / 772 CE)KhalafKhallādAl-Kisā’ī(from Kufah; d. 189 AH / 804 CE)Al-DūrīAbū’l-ḤārithAbū Bakr ʿĀṣim(from Kufah; d. 158 AH / 778 CE)ḤafṣIbn ʿAyyāshThe Additional Three Readers and Their NarrationsIn addition to the seven primary readers, Islamic scholars recognizethree supplementary readers, each transmitting two additional versions:Abū JaʿfarIbn WardānIbn JamāzYaʿqūb al-ḤāshimīRuwaysRawḥKhalaf al-BazzārIsḥāqIdrīs al-ḤaddādThough Islamic authorities affirm these as authentic, it is evident that there are at leasttwenty versionsof the Qur'an preserved through oral transmission, each with its distinct variations.Critical Questions for Theological ReflectionThe existence of these multiple readings and narrations raises several important theological and historical questions that remain largely unaddressed in contemporary Islamic discourse:Among these many Qur’anic readers, whose version is truly authoritative and correct?If Allah revealed the Qur'an to Muhammad, why are there numerous readers with differing versions, while the Prophet himself is not cited as a transmitter of any specific reading among these twenty?If Allah revealed the Qur'an to Muhammad alone, how did other individuals come to possess different versions of the same divine revelation?How can such variations be justified if the Qur'an is claimed to be a singular, unaltered, and perfect book in the Arabic language?If the Qur'an exists in only one Arabic form as frequently claimed, how can it be recited in twenty different forms within the same language?Do these discrepancies not contradict the assertion of a perfectly preserved revelation?Among these twenty versions of the Qur'an, which one is the original, authentic, and true version?By what criteria do Islamic scholars or believers determine the authenticity of one version over another?Which version did Prophet Muhammad himself recite and memorize?Is there evidence to confirm the exact version he followed, given that Islamic tradition ascribes the preservation of the Qur'an primarily to his personal recitation?ConclusionThis investigation highlights a critical issue within Islamic textual history—the presence of multiple accepted Qur'anic versions transmitted by various readers, each with distinct narrations. While Muslim scholars have attempted to explain these variations as acceptable within the tradition ofQirā’āt, this diversity raises serious theological implications for the claim of a single, unchanged Qur'an.It is evident that Islam harbors numerous concealed complexities, and the refusal to openly address them continues to obscure the religion's historical development. The acknowledgment of twenty Qur'anic versions is, therefore, not merely a scholarly observation but a profound theological dilemma for the claims of Islamic orthodoxy.May God bless you and open your eyes to truth.In His service,Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteMax Shimba Ministries Org.",

    "full_content": "Title:The Qur'anic Cosmology of Stars as Weapons Against Demons: A Theological and Scientific CritiqueBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba | Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionOnThursday, November 25, 2021, I encountered a striking and troubling doctrinal claim within Islamic scripture — a claim that exposes a profound theological and scientific incongruity in the Qur'an’s cosmology. According to several verses in the Qur'an,stars were created by Allah not only for adornment in the sky but also as missiles to hurl at demons (jinn or shayatin)who attempt to eavesdrop on the heavenly assembly. This assertion raises serious questions about the Qur'an’s compatibility with both established scientific knowledge and sound theological reasoning.This article seeks to translate, examine, and expand upon these Qur'anic claims, highlighting their inconsistencies and providing a critical Christian theological response.Qur'anic Verses on Stars as MissilesSurah 67:5 (Al-Mulk)\"And We have certainly beautified the nearest heaven with lamps and have made them (as missiles) to drive away the devils and have prepared for them the punishment of the Blaze.\"Surah 37:6–8 (As-Saffat)\"Indeed, We have adorned the nearest heaven with an adornment of stars, and as protection against every rebellious devil, so they may not listen to the exalted assembly (of angels) and are pelted from every side.\"Additional references can be found in:Surah 15:16–18,Surah 55:33–35, among others.Theological and Scientific ImplicationsThe Qur'anic claim suggests thatstars function as physical weapons used by Allah to strike demons attempting to access the heavens. In this worldview:Stars serve not merely as astronomical bodies but as divine artillery.Thepurpose of these celestial objects includes both cosmic decoration and metaphysical warfare.However, this notion collapses under both theological scrutiny and modern scientific understanding.Scientific IncompatibilityFrom a scientific standpoint:Stars are massive luminous spheres of plasma held together by gravity, undergoing nuclear fusion reactions in their cores.The nearest star to Earth, the Sun, is approximately93 million miles (150 million kilometers) away.To suggest that stars could be thrown or used as missiles iscategorically absurdby any standard of astrophysics. The laws of thermodynamics, gravitational theory, and astronomical observation uniformly contradict this assertion.Moreover, if even a small celestial body like an asteroid could devastate a planet, the concept of weaponizing entire stars isludicrously unfeasible.This presents a significant problem for the Qur'an’s claim to divine origin since a true Creator would possess and communicate accurate knowledge of the universe He created.Theological InconsistencyFrom a Christian theological perspective:God is omniscient, omnipotent, and sovereign over both the natural and spiritual realms(Job 38:4-7; Psalm 8:3-4; Colossians 1:16-17).Nowhere in the Bible are stars depicted as literal missiles used against spiritual beings.Scripture presents thestars as signs, for seasons, and as declarations of God's glory (Genesis 1:14-18; Psalm 19:1).In fact, the Bible consistently differentiates between the material and the spiritual realms, and while angels and demons interact with the physical world (Job 1-2; Luke 8:30-33), such interactions arenot through physical projectiles hurled from astronomical bodies.The Qur'an's cosmology reflects anancient, pre-scientific, mythological worldviewakin to pre-Islamic Arab folklore, wherecelestial phenomena were attributed to deities and metaphysical conflicts.Spiritual Error and Pagan ContinuityThis doctrine alsomirrors animistic and polytheistic traditions, where heavenly bodies were believed to possess personalities or be active participants in spiritual warfare. The Qur'an, while claiming monotheism, here retainselements of mythic cosmology inconsistent with true monotheism.In Christian doctrine:Spiritual battles occur in the unseen realms (Ephesians 6:12).God's sovereignty is exercised through His Word, His angels, and His Spirit — not through throwing physical stars.Thus, the Qur'anic depiction not onlylacks theological coherence but undermines Islam's claim of preserving the pure monotheism of Abrahamic faith.ConclusionThe claim thatAllah uses stars as missiles against demonsis bothscientifically untenable and theologically flawed. It reveals aprimitive cosmological understanding embedded within the Qur'anthat fails bothmodern scientific scrutinyandBiblical theology.As Christian theologians and apologists, it is imperative to critically engage these claims and presentthe rational, coherent, and biblically grounded worldview of the living God — the Creator of heaven and earth, whose creation declares His glory and whose sovereignty extends over both the seen and unseen realms without resorting to mythical cosmologies.Shalom.Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

MalikBut what exactly are these seven Earths? Are they continents on this single planet? Are they other planets like Earth? Before evaluating the scientific credibility of this claim, we must define what is meant by \"seven Earths,\" especially as Muhammad and early Muslims understood them. The teachings about seven Earths are found in the early Islamic sources: Hadith and Qur'anic commentaries (Tafsir).1. Evidence from Hadith LiteratureSahih Al-BukhariNarrated by Abu Salama ibn 'Abd al-Rahman:The Prophet said, \"Anyone who wrongfully takes a span of land, his neck will be encircled with seven Earths on the Day of Resurrection.\"(Vol. 4, Book 54, Hadith 417; see also 418, 420; Vol. 3, Book 43, Hadiths 632-634)Narrated by Abdullah:A Jewish rabbi told Muhammad that Allah would place the heavens, Earth, trees, and creation on different fingers. The Prophet confirmed it by smiling and reciting Surah 39:67.Sahih MuslimAbu Salama had a dispute over land and went to Aisha. She responded by citing the Prophet:\"Anyone who seizes even a hand-span of land unjustly will have seven layers of Earth wrapped around his neck.\"(Book 10, Hadith 3925)Al-TirmidhiAbu Hurayrah narrated a long hadith in which the Prophet described the seven heavens and seven Earths, each separated by a 500-year journey. He explained that even if a rope were dropped from the top, it would fall under the knowledge and authority of Allah.Ahmad and Al-TirmidhiThese Hadiths show Muhammad was not passively relaying common beliefs but was actively teaching a cosmic structure with seven heavens above and seven flat Earths below.2. Additional Islamic SourcesUbayy ibn Ka’b on Surah 7:172Ubayy reported that Allah made a covenant with the descendants of Adam and invoked the seven heavens and seven Earths as witnesses to that covenant.Abu Sa’id al-KhudriThe Prophet said that if the phrase“There is no god but Allah”were placed on one side of the scale, and the seven heavens and seven Earths on the other, the phrase would outweigh them.Ya’la ibn MurrahThe Prophet said that if someone wrongfully took land, Allah would dig him down through the seven Earths and bind them around his neck on the Day of Judgment.3. Legal and Devotional TextsFiqh-us-SunnahReports include prayers invoking \"Lord of the seven heavens and all they shade, Lord of the seven Earths and all they carry.\"The Prophet taught supplications where believers call on Allah as the \"Creator of the heavens and Earths\" to seek protection.4. Early Muslim Historians and CommentatorsIbn Abbas (Tafsir)Interpreted Surah 65:12 as affirming seven layered flat Earths, like domes or levels.Al-TabariDescribed the cosmos as layered: heavens and Earth within a cosmic structure (haykal) resembling tent cords surrounding land and sea, with Earth as seven flat islands.Ibn KathirAffirmed the literal understanding of seven flat Earths and rejected metaphorical interpretations such as seven continents.Al-Kisa’iDescribed each of the seven Earths by name and their inhabitants:Ramaka:barren wind and punished nation.Khalada:torture tools and self-cannibalizing nation.Arqa:deadly quilled birds and corrupt people.Haraba:massive snakes and bat-like creatures.Malthamu:stones of sulfur hanging on unbelievers.Sijjin:hellish records and bird-like people.Ajiba:home of Iblis and a black dwarf nation called Khasum.Sheikh Al-AlbaniA modern scholar who supported the existence of seven Earths based on Qur’an and Hadith, criticizing those who reject it under Western scientific influence. He referred to Qur’anic verse:\"It is Allah who created seven heavens and the Earth the like thereof.\" (65:12)Analysis and Scientific ConflictThe evidence from early Islamic sources shows that Muhammad and his companions believed in literal seven Earths, flat and layered, not spherical planets or metaphorical meanings. These were not symbolic but part of their cosmological framework, derived from or parallel to ancient Near Eastern and Judaic cosmologies.From a modern scientific perspective, this belief contradicts astronomy, geology, and planetary science. There is no evidence of seven flat Earths beneath our world, each inhabited by distinct peoples or creatures. These ideas reflect ancient cosmology, not divine revelation.ConclusionGiven the overwhelming weight of early Islamic sources and interpretations, it is inescapable to conclude that:The Qur'an’s teaching of seven heavens and seven Earths is a reflection of pre-scientific cosmology.Muhammad himself believed and taught that the universe was structured in seven layers of heavens and Earths, with vast distances and fantastical creatures.This model is not only scientifically incorrect but is also presented as divinely revealed truth.Thus, this undermines the Qur'an’s claim to scientific or divine perfection and further challenges the prophetic authority of Muhammad.Therefore, the Qur'an’s description of the universe is rooted in ancient myth and cannot be reconciled with modern scientific understanding. This raises serious theological implications about the authenticity of the Qur'an and the prophethood of Muhammad.Shalom,Dr. Maxwell ShimbaFor Max Shimba Ministries",

When you present them with evidence, they ask, \"Show me the verse.\" There are actually many passages in the Bible that show the truth that Jesus is God. So many!Once you give them a verse, they change and say, \"I want the words that Jesus Himself spoke.\"This is a FALSE and unbiblical criterion. The truth is, the WHOLE Bible is the Word of God. It does not matter if it was spoken by Moses, Isaiah, John, Peter, or Jesus Himself. It is written:For prophecy never had its origin in the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit. (2 Peter 1:21)Therefore, their demand, “I want the words that Jesus Himself spoke,” is an invalid and illogical criterion.The following is biblical evidence that JESUS CHRIST is God.John 8:58Jesus said to them, \"Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I AM.\"\"I AM\" is a name belonging only to God. We find this name when Moses spoke with God and was sent to deliver the children of Israel from Egypt. It is written:Moses said to God, \"Suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ Then what shall I tell them?\" God said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM.” (Exodus 3:13-14)A human exists because God caused him to exist. A car exists because an engineer or designer caused it to be. A house exists because a builder made it. But God—HE JUST IS!! He does not exist because of anything or anyone else! That is why He said, \"I AM WHO I AM!\" Jesus is I AM. Therefore, He is God.John 10:30I and the Father are one.Muslims claim that Jesus and God are one only in purpose, not in their essence. So I ask them about the following passage from Isaiah, and they have no answer:Isaiah 9:6For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.This verse is very clear. The one spoken about is Jesus, and He is called \"Mighty God.\"John 14:9Jesus said to him, \"Have I been with you so long, and you still do not know me, Philip? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, ‘Show us the Father’?\"Jesus said these words after being asked a very clear question, aimed at knowing GOD THE FATHER! It is written:Philip said to Him, \"Lord, SHOW US THE FATHER, and it is enough for us.\"Then Jesus answered plainly: \"Whoever has seen me has seen the Father.\"This means, \"I am the Father Himself.\"Revelation 1:17 and Revelation 22:13I am the First and the LastI am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.Only God has the authority to be the first and the last; Jesus is the Alpha and Omega. Therefore, He is God.John 1:1In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the WORD WAS GOD.Muslims do not like this verse at all because it is very clear. Jesus is the Word; and the Word is God; therefore, Jesus is God!John 20:28Thomas answered Him, \"MY LORD AND MY GOD!\"When Thomas said this, the Lord Jesus did not deny it and say, \"I am not God.\" Instead, Jesus said to him,\"Because you have seen Me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.\" (John 20:29)Acts 20:28Keep watch over yourselves and all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers. Be shepherds of the church of GOD, WHICH HE BOUGHT WITH HIS OWN BLOOD.Which God has blood? The answer is clear. This is Jesus Christ. He is the one who gave His life and shed His blood on the cross; and this is when He established the Church.Colossians 1:16For IN HIM ALL THINGS WERE CREATED: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through Him and for Him.All things were created in Him, Jesus. It means that all things originated from Jesus; because Jesus is the Word of God. And we know that the Creator of all things is God; therefore, Jesus is the Creator—He is God!Colossians 2:9For IN CHRIST ALL THE FULLNESS OF THE DEITY LIVES in bodily form.We are all imperfect people. We fall again and again into sin. Therefore, no ordinary human can boast that he is as perfect as God. But in Jesus “ALL the fullness of God dwells.” Why? Because He is that very God.1 Timothy 3:16Beyond all question, the mystery of godliness is great: GOD WAS MANIFESTED IN THE FLESH, was vindicated by the Spirit, was seen by angels, was preached among the nations, was believed on in the world, was taken up in glory.Which God was manifested in the flesh? The answer is clear. It is Jesus Christ alone.Titus 2:13…while we wait for the blessed hope—the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior, JESUS CHRIST,Jesus Christ is the Great God!!The MAIN problem Muslims have is this: They judge God by human standards. God says:\"Behold, I am the Lord, the God of all mankind. Is anything too hard for me?\" (Jeremiah 32:27)The answer is obvious. THERE IS NOTHING!But you will find Muslims asking very strange questions. For example, if Jesus is God, when He died, who was watching over the world?This is a question fit to be asked about a creature. If we were speaking of a human being who had died, then it would make sense to ask, while he was dead who was taking care of his family? Because this is a question about human attributes, since a human cannot be in two or more places at once. GOD IS NOT A HUMAN! HE IS ABLE TO DO ALL THINGS—ESPECIALLY THE GOD OF ABRAHAM, ISAAC, AND JACOB!JESUS IS GOD FOREVER AND EVER!!HALLELUJAH!!ReflectAsk questionsTake action!Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

Then, they claim that Muhammad is the true prophet because he came for the entire world. The scripture they use to oppose Jesus’ prophethood to the world is what Jesus said when speaking with the Canaanite woman (that is, a non-Jew), who was asking Jesus to heal her daughter.It is written:He answered, “I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel.” (Matthew 15:26).God is a God of order and perfect timing. That’s why He didn’t create everyone at once. He started with just one person, and from that person, we all came. Similarly, He began by revealing Himself to just one nation in the entire world. From there, salvation spreads to all nations. It’s a clear fact that, except for Israel, all other peoples in the world originally worshiped other gods (that is, demons). Only Israel began with the true God.That’s why when the Lord Jesus spoke to the Samaritan woman at the well, He told her:\"You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews.\" (John 4:22).Salvation comes from the Jews because no other nation in the world knew the true God—all had pagan religions—whether white, African, Indian, Arab, etc. That is the truth.To say that Jesus did not come for all nations is the same as saying, because God only created Adam and Eve, then He is not the God of my family since He didn’t create me the same way He created Adam.One day, Jesus spoke to His disciples and told them:\"This is what is written: The Messiah will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day, and repentance for the forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.\" (Luke 24:46-47).Do you see that the Gospel was to begin at Jerusalem? And do you also see that He says all nations will be preached in His name? Are all nations only Israel?The Canaanite woman came at a time that was not yet her time. That was the time for preaching the Gospel to Israel first, then to the whole world.Below are further words from the Lord Jesus Himself confirming that He was sent to all nations worldwide and that He is the Messiah of God, anointed by the Holy Spirit to redeem the entire world.\"But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.\" (Acts 1:8).\"Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.\" (Matthew 28:19).\"For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.\" (John 3:17).\"If anyone hears my words but does not keep them, I do not judge that person. For I did not come to judge the world, but to save the world.\" (John 12:47).\"I lay down my life for the sheep. I have other sheep that are not of this sheepfold; I must bring them also. They too will listen to my voice, and there shall be one flock and one shepherd.\" (John 10:15-16).\"And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.\" (Matthew 24:14).Let me conclude by reiterating a few things I have said. God has always started something with just one person.He created one man, then we all came from him.He revealed Himself to one nation, then we all came to know Him.He began with one Son (Jesus), and then we are all born by faith in Him.Likewise, He brought salvation to one nation, Israel, and then it spreads everywhere—that’s why He tells the Samaritan woman at the well, “Salvation is from the Jews.” (John 4:22).This pattern of starting with one person or place is proof that all those who comfort themselves with sayings like “all religions are different paths that lead to God” are deceiving themselves and wasting their time and their eternal life! \"Salvation is from the Jews\"—that is, THROUGH JESUS ALONE!So, because the time for the spread of salvation had not yet come (since God moves according to His schedule and timing), that is why He told the Canaanite woman (a non-Jew) that He was sent only to Israel.But when the fullness of time came, that is, after He died and rose again, we see Him commissioning His apostles to go to the whole world.And the Bible clearly states:\"Therefore, remember that formerly you who are Gentiles by birth and called 'uncircumcised' by those who call themselves 'the circumcision' (which is done in the body by human hands)—remember that at that time you were separate from Christ, excluded from citizenship in Israel and foreigners to the covenants of the promise, without hope and without God in the world. But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near by the blood of Christ. For he himself is our peace, who has made the two groups one and has destroyed the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility, by setting aside in his flesh the law with its commands and regulations. His purpose was to create in himself one new humanity out of the two, thus making peace, and in one body to reconcile both of them to God through the cross, by which he put to death their hostility.\" (Ephesians 2:11-16).ReflectAsk questionsThinkTake actionDr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

If there is, then Muslims, please bring it forward so we can see it.Abu Huraira said, \"I heard the Prophet of Allah say, 'There is no creature that is not touched by Satan, and that is why a baby cries loudly at birth, because Satan has touched him, EXCEPT for Mary and her son Jesus; they were not touched by Satan.' Then Abu Huraira said: 'And I seek refuge with You for her and her offspring from Satan' (Qur'an 3:36).\"My brothers and sisters, today Muhammad himself has admitted that JESUS was never touched by Satan, but he (Muhammad) and all Muslims have been touched and manipulated by Satan.EVERY MUSLIM HAS A JINN IN HIS BODYJinns are allowed to reside in the body of any Muslim, so every Muslim has at least one Jinn and possibly more. Likewise, Jinns are allowed to live in the homes of Muslims. In any house of a believer of that faith, there is a Jinn or Jinns residing. It is an undeniable truth that without Jinns there is no Islam, just as without the Holy Spirit there is no Christianity. It is Jinns who took Prophet Muhammad for forty days in the valleys, where they instructed him regarding the establishment of that Islamic faith.NOW LET US READ ABOUT JESUS CHRISTJesus was born with the Spirit of God (Matthew 1:18)The Holy Spirit descended when He was baptized (Luke 3:22)Jesus was led by the Holy Spirit (Luke 4:1)Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Holy Spirit (Luke 4:14)Jesus said, “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me...” (Luke 4:18)Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit (Luke 10:21)The ministry of Jesus was led by the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:22)Anointed with the Holy Spirit (Acts 10:38)Offered Himself—died—by the Spirit (Hebrews 9:14)Returned to life by the Holy Spirit (1 Peter 3:18)UNCLEAN JINNS WORSHIP ALLAH AND MUHAMMADTherefore, according to what Allah says in the Qur’an: “I have created jinn and humans only to worship Me” (Qur’an 57:58; 51:56), and also in heaven the Jinn worship (the Jinn who converted to Islam in 620 AD)—read Qur’an 72:14—these are good Jinn who travel and inherit eternal life in the Hereafter (Hell). The primary goal of Satan and the Jinn is to befriend as many humans as possible so that, by their numbers, he will have many to take with him to HELL (Qur’an 6:128). The important thing to know here is that the eternal fire was not created for humans but for Satan and all his angels (the Jinn or demons). These have no further chance to confess or repent.Jesus Christ, whom Muslims acknowledge only as a Prophet, had no friendship or association with Satan or demons (Jinn). He commanded demons to leave those who were tormented by them (Matthew 8:29; Mark 5, etc.).When Jesus left this world, He was taken up by a cloud and ascended upwards to heaven. Heaven is above, as the Qur’an confirms. Jesus was able to ascend and enter Heaven, but Jinn (demons) who have converted to Islam, when they merely try to ascend, are met with burning fire. We have seen that the Jinn who are Muslims by conversion live in the Hereafter, that is, in Hell. So, do you think other Muslims will end up anywhere different for eternity? In Islamic faith, it is believed that when a Muslim dies, there are two Jinns who guard him in his grave.EVERY MUSLIM HAS A JINN IN HIS BODYJinns are allowed to reside in the body of any Muslim, so every Muslim has at least one Jinn and possibly more. Likewise, Jinns are allowed to live in the homes of Muslims. In any house of a believer of that faith, there is a Jinn or Jinns residing. It is an undeniable truth that without Jinns there is no Islam, just as without the Holy Spirit there is no Christianity. It is Jinns who took Prophet Muhammad for forty days in the valleys, where they instructed him regarding the establishment of that Islamic faith.MY ADVICE TO CHRISTIANS:My free advice to Christians is this: NEVER LEAVE CHRIST TO ENTER INTO THE FAITHS OF DEMONS (1 Timothy 4:1-2).Jinns or demons are the same thing; there is no difference between them. All these demons/Jinn opposed God and were cast down to earth. The Bible says there is no forgiveness for Jinns because they have already been judged and are only waiting to be thrown into Hell.Satan is still “the prince of the power of the air” (Ephesians 2:2). This means that Satan and the other fallen angels can influence our minds and thoughts through music, television, debates, etc. We are told to guard our thoughts and minds (2 Corinthians 10:3-5). 2 Corinthians 4:4 tells us that the god of this world has blinded the minds of unbelievers.Satan is behind all false religions and world religions. Satan will do everything in his power to oppose God and all who follow Him. Although Satan’s fate is sealed: the lake of fire forever (Revelation 20:10).God bless you all,Shalom,Dr. Maxwell Shimba, servant of Jesus Christ, the Almighty God",

First, let's read:17. Surah Al-Isra (Bani Israel)90. And they said: We will not believe you until you cause a spring to gush forth for us from the earth,91. Or you have a garden of date-palms and grapes, and cause rivers to gush forth in their midst in abundance,92. Or you cause the sky to fall upon us in pieces as you claimed, or bring Allah and the angels before [us] face to face,93. Or you have a house of gold, or you ascend into the sky. And [even then], we will not believe in your ascension until you bring down to us a book we may read. Say: Glory be to my Lord! Am I anything but a human messenger?(Qur’an, Surah 17:90-93)After being asked to perform at least one miracle, Muhammad failed miserably and did not perform a single miracle.Question:Why did Muhammad fail to perform miracles as he was asked to do?Muhammad is the only prophet who failed to perform miracles since the creation of the world. Is he worthy to be followed and believed?Why didn’t Allah help His prophet to perform a miracle?THE QURAN SAYS THAT A PROPHET MUST PERFORM MIRACLES;MUHAMMAD ADMITS HE IS A FALSE PROPHET AND DID NOT PERFORM MIRACLESThe Qur’an itself confirms that prophets and messengers must perform miracles.Qur’an 40:78, Surah Al-Mu’min [The Believer]“And indeed We sent messengers before you: among them there are those We have told you about, and some We have not told you about. And it was not for any messenger to bring a miracle except by Allah’s permission.”Muhammad never performed any miracle to prove his prophethood and messengership.Qur’an 29:50, Surah Al-Ankabut (The Spider).“And they say: ‘Why have not signs been sent down to him from his Lord?’ Say: ‘The signs are only with Allah, and I am only a clear warner.’”(See also Qur’an 6:35-37; 13:7)Muhammad admits that he never performed miracles. Therefore, according to their own Quran, Muhammad is a false prophet.Beyond that, Muhammad never made any prophecy. So how can there be a prophet without prophecy?One of the characteristics of a prophet is to give prophecy. Muhammad never gave any prophecy.Brothers and sisters,Muhammad was not a prophet of God and did not have the qualities of a PROPHET.Muhammad never spoke with the God who sent him.Muhammad had Satan with him since his birth.Muhammad confessed to being played by Satan during his calling in the cave.Muhammad confessed that Satan played with his mind and soul.Muhammad confessed that he was bewitched by Labiid bin Al’answan.SO MUSLIMS, SHOW ME—where in the Torah, Psalms, or Gospel there is a prophet with such strange characteristics as Muhammad.Come to Jesus, who is the only Way to Heaven.God bless you all.TRULY, MUHAMMAD WAS A FALSE PROPHETShalom,Dr. Maxwell Shimba, servant of Jesus Christ, the Most High God.

    "full_content": "An Inquiry into Early Lactation Accounts in Islamic Tradition: The Case of Prophet Muhammad and the Importance of Maternal Breast MilkBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaMax Shimba Ministries OrgPublished: May 20, 2018AbstractThis paper examines an intriguing claim from early Islamic hadith literature that narrates the Prophet Muhammad being breastfed by a male relative, Abu Talib, following his birth due to the absence of his mother’s milk. The discussion seeks to place this narrative within a critical textual, historical, and biological framework while highlighting the scientific importance of maternal breast milk in infant health and development. Utilizing modern medical research alongside primary Islamic texts, the paper evaluates both theological narratives and empirical health science perspectives to understand potential implications.IntroductionIslamic historical tradition, primarily documented in hadith literature, records various episodes from the early life of the Prophet Muhammad. One notable yet rarely discussed narration suggests that Muhammad was breastfed by his uncle, Abu Talib, through a miraculous provision of milk, reportedly sent by Allah, before being entrusted to a wet nurse named Halima al-Sa’diya.This account, while unusual by contemporary biological standards, raises both theological and scientific questions, especially when considering the established importance of maternal breast milk in early childhood development. This paper translates and academically analyzes the narration, explores its possible theological interpretations, and contrasts it with medical research on breastfeeding’s role in child growth and immunity.Primary Textual SourceThe primary reference comes from an Islamic hadith collection cited as:Sahih Hadith Al-Kaft Al-Kukaynir, Volume 1, Page 284, Hadith No. 27, which records:“When the Prophet Muhammad was born, he spent a long time without his mother’s milk. However, Abu Talib was blessed by Allah to produce milk through his breasts, which he fed to Muhammad for several days, until Halima al-Sa’diya was found and entrusted with the infant.”Though this hadith is not among the widely authenticated sahih collections (such as Sahih al-Bukhari or Sahih Muslim), it reflects certain narratives preserved in regional or less-canonized Islamic texts.The Role of Breast Milk in Early Child Development: A Biomedical PerspectiveThe World Health Organization (WHO) recommends exclusive breastfeeding for infants for the first six months of life. Maternal breast milk is universally recognized as the optimal source of nutrition for newborns, providing a unique balance of nutrients, immune factors, and bioactive compounds essential for the development and protection of infants (World Health Organization, 2024).Key Nutritional Components of Human Breast Milk:Proteins:0.8%–0.9%, primarily casein, alpha-lactalbumin, lactoferrin, secretory IgA, lysozyme, and serum albumin.Fats:Approximately 4.5%, rich in triglycerides (notably palmitic acid, oleic acid), essential fatty acids like linoleic acid, and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), which have anti-inflammatory and potential anticancer properties.Carbohydrates:Around 7.1%, predominantly lactose, alongside several human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) that protect against intestinal pathogens.Minerals:0.2%, including calcium, magnesium, and trace elements vital for growth.Significantly,secretory Immunoglobulin A (IgA)levels remain elevated in human milk from birth up to several months postpartum, providing mucosal immunity against pathogens.Moreover, breast milk containsalpha-lactalbumin, which in acidic stomach environments binds with oleic acid to formHAMLET (Human Alpha-lactalbumin Made Lethal to Tumor cells)— a complex shown to induce apoptosis in tumor cells, contributing to reduced cancer susceptibility in breastfed infants (Svensson et al., 2000).Religious and Theological ImplicationsThe narration of Prophet Muhammad’s wet nursing by Abu Talib introduces a significant theological and anthropological curiosity. Islam strictly prescribes milk kinship (rida’a), where children breastfed by the same woman become milk-siblings, affecting permissible marital relations. The report of a man lactating, even through divine provision, would be extraordinary in both pre-Islamic and Islamic Arabia, where male lactation is neither culturally normative nor biologically typical.Theologically, this narrative may have aimed to illustrate Allah’s miraculous provision for His Prophet. However, from a medical perspective,male galactorrhea— the spontaneous production of milk in males — is a documented but pathological condition associated with hormonal imbalances (e.g., elevated prolactin levels due to pituitary disorders).Scientific Infeasibility of Male BreastfeedingWhile rare,male lactationhas been reported in medical literature, typically in pathological or extreme hormonal circumstances (Jensen, 1992). The biological mechanism involves prolactin, a hormone primarily responsible for milk production in mammals. In normal male physiology, prolactin levels are insufficient for lactation.Cases of male lactation are medically classified and treated as endocrine disorders, not normative biological functions. Thus, the hadith’s claim, if taken literally, contradicts established biological science and would necessitate a supernatural intervention as posited by the narrative.ConclusionThe narration of the Prophet Muhammad being breastfed by Abu Talib is a remarkable theological tradition but scientifically implausible by modern endocrinology and pediatrics. The incident, if interpreted allegorically, underscores the protective providence of Allah over His Prophet. From a medical standpoint, the importance of maternal breast milk for optimal infant development is irreplaceable and universally affirmed by contemporary health authorities.While ancient narratives occasionally reflect cultural beliefs about miracles and divine provision, they must be critically assessed against established biomedical knowledge. The well-documented nutritional, immunological, and developmental benefits of maternal breastfeeding remain uncontested and continue to be a cornerstone of public health policy globally.ReferencesSvensson, M., et al.

    "full_content": "The Myth of the Two Seas Not Mixing in the Qur'an: A Scientific and Theological ResponseAuthor:Maxwell Shimba, Servant of Jesus Christ, the Great God (Titus 2:13)Date:May 16, 2018AbstractThis paper addresses the widely circulated claim among some Muslim apologists that the Qur’an contains a miraculous statement regarding the phenomenon of two bodies of water not mixing. By examining the Qur’anic passage in question alongside basic physical science — particularly concepts from physics such as density, salinity, and temperature — this study aims to demonstrate that the phenomenon is not a miracle but rather a well-understood natural occurrence. Furthermore, this article critiques the theological implications of attributing natural processes to divine miracles without scientific understanding.IntroductionAmong certain Islamic apologetic circles, there has persisted a claim that the Qur'an miraculously foretold a scientific phenomenon whereby two bodies of water meet but do not mix. This claim is often linked toSurah Al-Kahf (18:60-82), where it is mentioned:“And remember when Moses said to his servant: 'I will not give up until I reach the junction of the two seas or continue for a long period.'”(Qur'an 18:60)Many Muslim commentators have associated this verse with images showing the meeting of two distinct water bodies — typically a glacier-fed stream and a saltwater bay, claiming it as a miraculous confirmation of divine revelation. In this paper, we will scrutinize this claim using elementary physics and hydrology, demonstrating that this is not a miracle but a scientifically explainable event.Defining the Scientific ConceptsDensityIn physics,density(symbolized as ρ, the Greek letter rho) is a measure that compares the mass of a substance to its volume. The formula for density is:Density (ρ)=Mass (m)Volume (V)\\text{Density (ρ)} = \\frac{\\text{Mass (m)}}{\\text{Volume (V)}}Objects or substances with higher density have more matter packed into a given volume than those with lower density. The standard units for measuring density areg/cm³orkg/m³.For example, freshwater has a density of1.0 kg/L at 4°C, while seawater, due to its higher salt content, typically has a density of around1.025 kg/L.MassMass is a fundamental property of matter indicating the quantity of material present in a body. It is commonly measured inkilograms (kg).VolumeVolume refers to the three-dimensional space occupied by a substance or object. In physics, it is measured incubic meters (m³)orcubic centimeters (cm³).Salinity and Water ClassificationSeawaterSeawater is a solution containing dissolved salts, primarily sodium chloride (NaCl). On average, the world’s oceans have a salinity of3.5%, meaning there are approximately35 grams of dissolved salts per liter of seawater. This increases the density of seawater compared to freshwater.Salinity affects not only the density but also the freezing point of water. For example, seawater typically freezes at around-2°C (28°F)depending on salinity levels. Additionally, seawater’spH typically ranges from 7.5 to 8.4.FreshwaterFreshwater, such as that found in rivers, lakes, and rainfall, has significantly less dissolved salt, typically under0.1% salinity. Because of its lower salinity, freshwater has a lower density and different thermal properties compared to seawater.Scientific Explanation of the PhenomenonThe famous images often circulated by Islamic preachers — showing what appears to be two distinct water bodies refusing to mix — are typically photographs taken from theGulf of Alaska, whereglacial meltwatermeetsoffshore saltwater.The explanation for this occurrence is not miraculous but rather based on simple, observable scientific principles:Density Difference:Freshwater from melting glaciers is less dense than the saline seawater. This difference in density inhibits immediate mixing.Temperature Gradient:Both water bodies are extremely cold, which slows down the rate of diffusion and mixing.Salinity Difference:The stark contrast in salt content between glacial meltwater (very low salinity) and seawater (approximately 3.5% salinity) results in different physical properties, which delay mixing.Kinetic Energy:The process of mixing solutions, especially in liquids at low temperatures, takes longer because of reduced molecular motion.A useful analogyis dissolving sugar in water: sugar dissolves quickly in hot water due to high molecular movement but much slower in cold water. Similarly, cold freshwater and cold seawater mix slowly because of limited molecular interaction.Thus, what appears to be two water bodies not mixing is simply a gradual, natural mixing process dictated by physics, not a supernatural event.Clarifying MisconceptionsIt is important to clarify thatthis phenomenon does not involve two seasas the Qur'anic verse suggests. The images used by Muslims to illustrate this claim depict the confluence ofglacial freshwater and seawater, not the meeting of two seas.Furthermore,the notion of water bodies having permanent barriers between them contradicts oceanographic knowledge. All water bodies eventually mix over time, though the rate of mixing depends on temperature, salinity, and density.Theological ReflectionWhile Islamic apologetics often seeks to attribute unexplained natural phenomena to divine intervention, it is essential to distinguish between true miracles and scientifically explainable occurrences. Claiming natural events as miracles where science offers clear explanations reflects a lack of scientific understanding.From a Christian theological perspective,God is the Creator of the laws governing nature (Colossians 1:16-17). To attribute every unexplained event to miraculous intervention rather than understanding His creation through the lens of science diminishes the richness of both theology and natural philosophy.ConclusionThe claim that the Qur'an contains miraculous knowledge about two bodies of water not mixing is unfounded when examined scientifically. The observed phenomenon in places like the Gulf of Alaska is a natural result of differences in density, temperature, and salinity, and is well-explained by elementary physics and hydrology.This study reaffirms the importance of sound scientific understanding in interpreting natural events and cautions against attributing divine intervention to phenomena that are part of the natural order established by God.ReferencesMillero, F.

In several Surahs of the Qur'an, Allah claims to be Most Forgiving and Most Merciful. However, these assertions are in stark contrast to His recorded actions. Allah’s love is entirely different from His deeds. That is why he sent a prophet whom he describes as insane, a man as inconsistent as his Allah.For example, inSurah Al-Hijr 15:6, the Qur'an records:\"And they say: ‘O you upon whom the Reminder has been sent down, indeed you are mad!’\"ALLAH, THE DESTROYER OF GENERATIONSIn several verses, the Qur'an shows that Allah takes pride in annihilating previous generations and punishing entire communities:Surah Al-An’am 6:5–6:\"But they have denied the truth when it came to them, so soon will come to them the news of what they used to mock at. Have they not seen how many generations We destroyed before them, whom We had established on the earth as We have not established you? And We sent the sky upon them in abundance, and made rivers flow beneath them; then We destroyed them for their sins and raised up after them another generation.\"Surah Al-A’raf 7:4:\"And how many towns have We destroyed! Our punishment came upon them by night or while they were sleeping at noon.\"Surah Yunus 10:13:\"And We certainly destroyed generations before you when they did wrong; and their messengers had come to them with clear proofs, but they would not believe. Thus do We recompense the criminal people.\"Surah Al-Hijr 15:4:\"And We did not destroy any city but that it had a known decree.\"IS THIS ATTRIBUTE OF DESTROYING AND KILLING PEOPLE THAT OF GOD OR OF SATAN?The Scriptures say this:John 10:7–15 (NKJV):Then Jesus said to them again, “Most assuredly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep. All who ever came before Me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them. I am the door. If anyone enters by Me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture.The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly.I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd gives His life for the sheep. But a hireling, he who is not the shepherd, one who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf catches the sheep and scatters them.The hireling flees because he is a hireling and does not care about the sheep. I am the good shepherd; and I know My sheep, and am known by My own. As the Father knows Me, even so I know the Father; and I lay down My life for the sheep.”The Son of God made it clear that Satan’s work has always been to steal, kill, and destroy. He has never changed — though he alters his names from time to time, today calling himself Allah. Ever since he was cast out of heaven, this has been his agenda on earth. And the Lord Jesus stated it plainly and without hesitation. The mission of the Lord Jesus is to give us life, and life in abundance.The enemy has always been a murderer, as evident in the way followers of Allah kill Christians in Islamic countries. Wherever he operates, there is destruction, jihad, and terrorism. At times, I find myself reflecting: what is wrong with humanity? Why do people befriend Satan and willingly become his slaves? When you choose to live in sin, you are essentially making an alliance with Satan for your life. And I assure you — you cannot avoid being robbed, killed, or devastated by Satan.Shalom,Dr. Max ShimbaA bondservant of Jesus Christ, our Great God and Savior.Titus 2:13",

While the Bible emphasizes the permanence of the marital bond, the Qur'an provides a structured procedure for initiating and finalizing divorce. This theological divergence raises fundamental questions regarding the nature of Allah in Islam. If Satan seeks to destroy families through separation and divorce, yet Allah explicitly legislates such acts in the Qur'an, then one must ask: What is the true nature and identity of Allah according to the moral framework of divine revelation? The paper evaluates this contrast and concludes with reflections on the biblical foundation of marital unity.IntroductionThe sanctity of marriage is foundational in Judeo-Christian theology. It is considered a divine institution, a covenant not only between two human beings but one joined and witnessed by God Himself. Conversely, Islamic theology, as expressed in the Qur’an and Hadith, accommodates and regulates the practice of divorce (talāq) as a permitted—even expected—reality of human life. This raises significant theological concerns, especially when compared with the biblical view that God hates divorce (Malachi 2:16). This article attempts to analyze the implications of this divergence and interrogate the moral and spiritual character of Allah as revealed in Islamic doctrine.The Meaning and Legal Understanding of DivorceDivorce, ortalakain Swahili (from the Arabictalāq), meansto separateorto sever ties. In legal terms, particularly in many modern judicial systems, it refers to a court-issued decree that formally dissolves a marital union. In many African contexts, informal street-level pronouncements of divorce—whether verbal or written—are not recognized under national law. Judicial divorce ensures that the rights and responsibilities of both parties are clarified, especially concerning property, custody, and spousal support.The Biblical View on Marriage and DivorceGod’s original intention for marriage is clear in Genesis 2:24, where it is written:“Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.”Jesus reaffirms this divine standard in Matthew 19:3-6, stating:“Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.”According to 1 Corinthians 7:39, a woman is bound to her husband as long as he lives, underscoring the covenantal and permanent nature of marriage.Moreover, inMalachi 2:15–16, Scripture clearly affirms:“For the Lord God of Israel says that He hates divorce.”Thus, from a biblical perspective, divorce is not merely discouraged—it is viewed as a violation of God's holy covenant, with severe spiritual and social consequences.Satan's Role in Promoting Divorce According to Islamic SourcesAccording to various Islamic theological texts and Hadiths, Satan (Shayṭān) actively promotes discord in marriages. Sheikh Dr. Ahmad H. Sakr, in his workAsili ya Majini(The Nature of Jinn), writes on page 39:“The greatest effort of Satan is to create separation between husband and wife. By doing so, he ensures that they begin to hate each other. Eventually, this leads to divorce. This breakup creates dysfunction in the family. When separation or divorce occurs, children are not raised adequately by one parent alone. They lack emotional stability, which makes it easier for Satan (the jinn) to enter into their hearts and minds. He will then lead them astray, causing them to become criminals in society.”This Islamic view aligns with the biblical perspective that Satan is the destroyer of families (John 10:10), and divorce is one of his primary tools.Allah as the Legislator of Divorce: A Quranic OverviewDespite acknowledging that Satan is behind the destruction of families, the Qur'an paradoxically attributes the legislation and regulation of divorce directly to Allah.Surah Al-Ahzab (33:49):“O you who believe! When you marry believing women, and then divorce them before you have touched them, there is no waiting period (iddah) for you to count concerning them. So provide for them and release them in a handsome manner.”Surah Al-Baqarah (2:230):“And if he divorces her [for the third time], then she is not lawful to him afterward until she marries another husband. If the latter divorces her, then there is no sin upon them to return to each other if they think they can keep within the limits of Allah.”These verses reveal not only the permissibility but also the systematic structure of divorce under Islamic law. They suggest that Allah is not merely allowing divorce but actively organizing the manner in which it should occur.Theological Implications: Who is Allah?If Satan is said to delight in breaking apart marriages, and Allah provides detailed guidance on how to do so, then a moral contradiction arises. According to Islamic theology, Allah is the source of these divorce laws. Yet, the resulting harm—broken families, psychologically wounded children, and moral chaos—is consistent with what Satan desires.This leads to a provocative theological question:If the fruits of divorce align with Satan’s goals, and Allah is the author of divorce laws, then can Allah be truly righteous and holy?In Christian theology, a god who promotes actions with demonic outcomes cannot be the same as the holy and loving Creator described in the Bible. Jesus Christ said, “A house divided against itself cannot stand” (Mark 3:25). If Allah both permits what Satan promotes, and that permission brings forth evil, can he be the true God?Conclusion: The True Character of God and the Sanctity of MarriageThis analysis reveals a stark contrast between the God of the Bible and the Allah of the Qur’an in matters of marriage and divorce. The God of the Bible desires lifelong covenant, unity, and love, and views divorce as a painful fracture of His intended design. Conversely, Allah not only permits but regulates and institutionalizes divorce, even when such practices are admitted to cause societal decay and family dysfunction.Thus, from a biblical and theological standpoint,the character of Allah as described in Islamic doctrine aligns more closely with the destructive intentions of Satan than with the righteousness of the Holy God of Scripture.BibliographyHoly Bible, ESV, Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:3-6; Malachi 2:16; 1 Corinthians 7:39The Quran, Surah Al-Ahzab (33:49), Surah Al-Baqarah (2:230)Sakr, Ahmad H.,Asili ya Majini, Islamic Foundation, pg. 39Shimba, Max.Personal Theological Blog Post, April 29, 2018Titus 2:13 – “Waiting for our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ.”",

This has become one of their main arguments on social media and in public debates, and unfortunately, through this deception, they have managed to convince many to leave Christianity and convert to Islam — all because they were told that“Jesus prostrated,”so therefore,Jesus was a Muslim!😨😨😨This is truly sad, as the Scripture says:➡“My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.”⬅—Hosea 4:6This deception thrives primarily because many Christians are negligent and unwilling to study the Bible for themselves. Some don't even own a Bible! So when a deceptive Muslim presents their arguments, such Christians are easily swayed — they don’t stand a chance because they are unprepared. How can you refute someone when you don’t even know your own Scriptures? 😎😎Let’s address the topic: ⤵⤵Muslims claim thatJesus was a Muslimsimply becauseHe prostrated.(According to their logic, anyone who performs an act similar to theirs — such as prostrating, wearing a robe, or having a beard — is automatically a Muslim, even if that person never heard of Allah or entered a mosque! 😂😂)For instance, since Jesus wore a robe and had a beard, Muslims say, “He was a Muslim!”So to them, Islam is just about outward appearances — robes, beards, and prostration. Anyone doing such is declared a Muslim!They often begin their deception by asking:“Do you know Jesus prostrated? And who else prostrates today?”If you answer,“Muslims,”they triumphantly reply,“See! Jesus was a Muslim because Muslims prostrate and Christians don’t!”😵😵😵Then they might ask:“You Christians kneel — where did you get that from, since Jesus prostrated?”This is a weak and laughable argument.😂😂😂😂😂😂Here’s what they usually cite:Matthew 26:39➡“And He went a little farther, and fell on His face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.”⬅☝☝☝☝This is the verse they use to deceive people, saying “Jesus was a Muslim” becauseHe prostrated.😂😂But pay close attention:The verse doesnotsay “Jesus prostrated.”It says“He fell on His face.”There is a difference betweenprostratingandfalling on your face(also translated as lying prostrate or flat on the ground).In Islamic prostration:Knees touch the groundPalms touch the groundToes point forwardForehead and nose touch the groundBut thechest, stomach, and thighs don’t touch the groundThebuttocks remain raised— this is the Islamic posture of sujood (prostration).Butfalling on your facemeans lyingcompletely flaton the ground — from the face to the chest, stomach, thighs, and legs — the whole body touches the ground! The buttocks donotremain elevated as in Islamic prostration.(See the picture below of a bishop lying flat in prayer — that’s falling on the face, as Jesus did.)So where in the Bible does it say“Jesus prostrated”?Nowhere! Muslims useMatthew 26:39, but it doesn’t saysujood— it says Hefell on His face.Do Muslims fall flat like that when they pray? No.Therefore,Jesus was not a Muslim.Even if He had prostrated in the Islamic fashion,that wouldn’t make Him a Muslim.If I prostrate today, does that make me a Muslim?Many beings prostrate — does that make them Muslim too? Dogs, pigs, jinn, and other creatures all prostrate — so, are they Muslims too?Quran 16:49says:➡“And to Allah prostrates whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth of moving creatures and the angels...”⬅Also,Quran 13:15says:➡“And unto Allah prostrates whoever is in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly, and their shadows as well in the mornings and the evenings.”⬅So, by that logic, evendogs, pigs, turtles, lizards, insects— all are Muslims? 😂😂😀😀Muslims, are we together?You claim Jesus fell on His face, so He was a Muslim.But evenunclean spirits (demons)fell on their faces before Jesus:Mark 3:11➡“Whenever the unclean spirits saw Him, they fell down before Him and cried out, ‘You are the Son of God!’”⬅So… are those demons Muslims too?Or what about this man possessed by demons?Mark 5:2-3,6➡2 When Jesus got out of the boat, a man with an impure spirit came from the tombs to meet him.3 This man lived in the tombs...6 When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell on his knees in front of him.⬅If Islam is defined by prostrating, thenall these creatures and beings are Muslims!😀😀😀This is why I say:Jesus is NOT a Muslim.He did NOT prostrate as Muslims do.Even if He had, it wouldn’t make Him a Muslim — people are not made Muslims by mere acts of posture!As for that question Muslims ask:“Where did Christians get kneeling from, when Jesus prostrated?”Answer:First of all —Jesus didn’t prostrate!Second, nowhere in Scripture does God demand worship in onlyone specific posture.Whether you kneel, stand, fall flat, or even prostrate like Muslims — God looks at theheart, not merely the posture.Christians do all these postures — but Muslims stubbornly hold onto one. For them, kneeling is almost considered a sin!Yet even kings, prophets, and apostlesknelt in prayer:✔King Solomon knelt in prayer:1 Kings 8:54➡“When Solomon finished all these prayers and supplications to the Lord, he rose from before the altar of the Lord, where he had been kneeling with his hands spread out toward heaven.”⬅✔King David also knelt:Psalm 95:6➡“Come, let us bow down in worship, let us kneel before the Lord our Maker.”⬅You’re free to choose — bow or kneel!✔Daniel knelt:Daniel 6:10➡“Now when Daniel learned that the decree had been published, he went home... he got down on his knees three times a day and prayed, giving thanks to his God...”⬅✔Stephen knelt before dying:Acts 7:59-60➡“While they were stoning him, Stephen prayed, ‘Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.’ Then he fell on his knees and cried out, ‘Lord, do not hold this sin against them.’ When he had said this, he fell asleep.”⬅✔ And yes, evenJesusknelt to pray:Luke 22:41➡“He withdrew about a stone’s throw beyond them, knelt down and prayed.”⬅👏👏(Muslims somehownever quotethis verse — where Jesuskneelsin prayer!)So we Christians follow Jesus, the prophets, and the apostles bykneeling in prayer.God is not concerned withform, but withreverence, respect, and fear of Him.Don’t sit casually as if you’re in a bar —God is not your buddy.Don’t let Muslims deceive you.Jesus is not a Muslim— and never will be!Any questions? You're welcome!God bless you all!— Dr. Maxwell Shimba, a servant of Christ Jesus.✋✋",

    "full_content": "Sunday, April 30, 2017JESUS IS GOD “THE WORD FROM ALLAH” ACCORDING TO THE QURANAllah says Jesus is the WORDThe Bible says that the Word is GodAllah says that Jesus in the Quran is the WORD that came from Him. This means that the origin of Jesus is not human, but rather the Word that comes from God. The very same Quran says that the Word of Allah has no beginning, meaning the Word of Allah has always been with Allah and was not created. (Allah’s word is eternal) See Surah 6:115, Surah 10:64, Surah 18:27.Let’s read the verses from the Quran which state that Jesus is the WORD:Surah Al Imran 45: “When the angels said: O Mary! Indeed Allah gives you good news of a Word from Him. His name will be the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, held in honor in this world and the Hereafter, and of those nearest to Allah.”The Quran acknowledges that Mary had a child THROUGH THE WORD OF ALLAH. Therefore, Jesus’ origin is the WORD and not simply human. Refer to Surah Al Imran verse 45.Surah An-Nisaa 171: “O People of the Book! Do not go to excess in your religion, nor say anything about Allah except the truth. The Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, was only a messenger of Allah, and His WORD which He conveyed to Mary, and a spirit from Him. So believe in Allah and His messengers, and do not say ‘Three.’ Cease! (It is) better for you. Allah is only one God. Glory be to Him! (Far Exalted is He) above having a son. His is whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And Allah is sufficient as Disposer of affairs.”Allah continues to say that Jesus is HIS WORD. Therefore, Jesus, who is the Word of God, was with God always. See also Surah 6:115, Surah 10:64, Surah 18:27.What does the Bible say about the WORD?THE BIBLE SAYS THE WORD IS GODJohn 1:1:“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.”In John chapter 1, verse 1, we are taught that the WORD was with God in the beginning before anything was created. At the same time, the Quran says that Allah created Jesus by the Word which was with Allah from the very beginning.I would like you to know that the Quran, which says that Jesus was created from the WORD, was written 632 years after the Bible. This means the Bible was written first, and then the Quran followed.ALLAH TELLS YOU, WHO HAVE DOUBTS:If you do not believe what Max Shimba says, then ask the People of the Book. We Christians and Jews are the People of the Book. Allah means that the People of the Book—that is, us Christians and Jews—have the right and authority to verify the claims of the Quran as true or false. Read:Surah Yunus 94:“If you are in doubt concerning what We have revealed to you, then ask those who read the Book before you. The truth has certainly come to you from your Lord, so do not be among those who doubt.”This verse from Surah Yunus, which was revealed in Mecca and translated by Sheikh Ali Muhsin Al-Barwani, confirms that the People of the Book are those with the authority to verify the truth of the Quran. I therefore confirm that JESUS IS THE WORD, and THE WORD IS GOD, as these were stated 632 years before the revelation of Surah Yunus in Mecca and can be found in the Gospel of John, chapter 1, verse 1.Allah tells Muhammad in Surah Yunus verse 94 that if Muhammad has any doubts about the truth that Jesus is the Word and the Word is God, then Muhammad should ask Christians: “Are these claims of Allah true?” The Bible is complete and affirms, without any doubt, that Jesus is the Word and the Word was with God before the beginning. Allah Himself also admits that Jesus is the Word which was with God even before the beginning.Today, I have answered the question of Muslims: Is Jesus God? Both the Quran and Allah say that Jesus is the WORD, and the Bible says that the WORD IS GOD.In His service,Dr. Maxwell ShimbaCopyright © Max Shimba Ministries 2015",

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteOriginally written: Wednesday, March 29, 2017IntroductionSince the establishment of the covenant between God and the nation of Israel at Mount Sinai, the biblical record consistently portrays a divine pattern whereby God communicates and relates to humanity through the ministry ofpriests. In this arrangement, there existed aHigh Priest (Kuhani Mkuu)and subordinate priests who operated under his authority.According to the Old Testament (Tanakh), among the twelve tribes of Israel, God specifically chose the tribe ofLevito serve as priests.Deuteronomy 10:8 (NKJV)“At that time the Lord separated the tribe of Levi to bear the ark of the covenant of the Lord, to stand before the Lord to minister to Him and to bless in His name, to this day.”This Levite priesthood was tasked with the care of the tabernacle (the Tent of Meeting), the sacred articles, and everything pertaining to the rituals of Israel’s worship.Numbers 1:50 (NKJV)“But you shall appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of the Testimony, over all its furnishings, and over all things that belong to it; they shall carry the tabernacle and all its furnishings; they shall attend to it and camp around the tabernacle.”At the head of this Levitical order wasAaron, who was anointed as the firstHigh Priestof Israel.The New Testament Shift: The Priesthood of MelchizedekWith the coming ofJesus Christ, a new covenant was established, along with a new priesthood. The writer of Hebrews affirms that Jesus did not serve under the Levitical priesthood but rather after the order ofMelchizedek—a mysterious figure who appears in Genesis 14 and is referenced in Psalm 110:4.Hebrews 7:15-17 (NKJV)“And it is yet far more evident if, in the likeness of Melchizedek, there arises another priest who has come, not according to the law of a fleshly commandment, but according to the power of an endless life. For He testifies: ‘You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.’”Unlike the Levitical priesthood, which was based on hereditary descent and legal prescriptions, Christ’s priesthood is eternal and grounded in divine decree.Christ as the Eternal High PriestConsequently,Jesus is the sole High Priest in this New Covenant era, fulfilling the role eternally:Hebrews 7:24 (NKJV)“But He, because He continues forever, has an unchangeable priesthood.”And under His eternal priesthood, all true ministers of God today—whether pastors, evangelists, or spiritual leaders—serve aspriests under the authority of Jesus Christ.1 Peter 2:9 (NKJV)“But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, His own special people, that you may proclaim the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.”This passage affirms the priestly status of all believers under the New Covenant, with Jesus as the unchallenged and eternal High Priest.Theological Inquiry Concerning MuhammadThis brings us to a critical theological examination concerningMuhammad, the founder of Islam. According to Islamic claims, Muhammad served as a prophet and spiritual leader. However, examining his ministry through a biblical-theological lens raises important questions regarding his priestly authority and divine legitimacy.Key Questions:Was Muhammad a priest?The biblical framework for priesthood requires either ordination under the Levitical order (Old Covenant) or under the eternal priesthood of Jesus Christ (New Covenant). There is no record or claim, even within Islamic sources, of Muhammad being a priest in any biblical or Levitical sense.If he was a priest, under which priesthood did he serve? Was it under the Levitical priesthood, or under Jesus Christ?Since the Levitical priesthood ceased with the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple in 70 A.D. and was already declared obsolete in light of Christ’s eternal priesthood (Hebrews 8:13), and given that Muhammad was neither a Levite nor a follower of Jesus Christ’s priestly order, he cannot be classified under either.If not, from which god did his authority originate?This is a pivotal theological question. If Muhammad did not serve under the God of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and the revealed order of priesthood established in both the Old and New Testaments, one must critically question the divine source of his spiritual authority.Dear Muslim brethren, who is your priest?Every spiritual system requires a mediatorial figure between humanity and the divine. In biblical theology, Jesus isthe only mediator between God and mankind(1 Timothy 2:5). If Muhammad is not a priest after God’s established orders, and Islam rejects the priesthood of Christ, it leaves a significant theological vacuum regarding mediation and priestly representation before God.ConclusionThe priesthood ofJesus Christstands supreme, eternal, and exclusive in the New Covenant era. The claims of any subsequent prophet, including Muhammad, must be measured against the divine priestly order established in Scripture. The absence of a recognized, biblically sanctioned priestly role for Muhammad raises critical questions about his theological legitimacy within the framework of revealed Judeo-Christian tradition.Abiria chunga maisha yako (Passengers, take care of your life)!There is no one like Jesus!Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

    "full_content": "Tuesday, January 10, 2017“MUSLIMS, AWAKEN FROM SLUMBER TO REALIZE THAT CHRISTIANS ARE NOT INFIDELS”I know you may be surprised and wonder how a Muslim can awaken when you believe that your eyes are already open. When I say this, I mean that although you think you are fully aware, your belief about Christians—that they are infidels—is based solely on what you have been taught. You accepted it because the Quran says so:“And the Jews say, ‘Uzair is the son of God,’ and the Christians say, ‘The Messiah is the son of God.’ That is their statement from their mouths; they imitate the saying of those who disbelieved before. May Allah destroy them; how they are deluded!”—Al-Tawba (9:30)Upon reading this verse, a Muslim is led to believe that Christians are infidels simply because they claim that Jesus is the Son of God. You believe that these words—Jesus being the Son of God—are invented by Christians themselves, and therefore, you consider us infidels. You rejoice that the Quran came to warn against this:“And to warn those who say, ‘Allah has taken a son.’”—Al-Kahf (18:4)“They have no knowledge of it, nor do their forefathers. Grave is the word that comes out of their mouths; they speak not except a lie.”—Al-Kahf (18:5)You accept without reflection that the Quran came to warn Christians for claiming that God has a son. But before you jump to labeling Christians as infidels, awaken and examine the truth. Today, I want to awaken you so that if you desire to enter the Kingdom of God, you may join me in understanding.Do Christians Truly Say That Jesus Is the Son of God?This is a crucial question to ask before accepting that Christians speak falsely or that calling them infidels is justified. Before Christians existed, and before Jesus—the origin of Christianity—was born, the angel announced to Mary:Luke 1:30–35: “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you shall name him Jesus. He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High; the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David. His kingdom will have no end. The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore, the child to be born will be holy, the Son of God.”It was the angel who proclaimed that Jesus would be called the Son of God, not the Christians themselves. Even God affirmed this truth:Matthew 17:1–6: Jesus took Peter, James, and John up a high mountain. There, his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became white as light. Suddenly, Moses and Elijah appeared and spoke with him. A bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said: “This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased. Listen to him.”Ask yourself, Muslim reader: Were the angel and God themselves Christians? Can God or His angels be infidels? Even Jesus confirmed his identity as the Son of God:John 9:35–38: “Do you believe in the Son of God?” Jesus asked. The man replied, “Who is he, Lord, that I may believe?” Jesus said, “You have seen him; he is speaking to you.” The man said, “I believe, Lord,” and worshiped him.Could Jesus truly be an infidel? He is the one revealing to Christians that he is the Son of God, and Peter acknowledged this truth (Matthew 16:13–17).Christians Are Not InfidelsSaying Jesus is the Son of God is a divine revelation. So why do Muslims believe that Christians are infidels for acknowledging this truth? Muhammad framed it as a test, suggesting that acknowledging Jesus as the Son of God makes one a disbeliever—but the Scriptures themselves (Nehemiah 5:8–9; Galatians 3:26–29) show otherwise. Christians did not become infidels merely by believing in Jesus; rather, true infidelity was opposed to the Jewish people, the enemies of God’s chosen people.Moreover, the Quran itself shows the context:“You will surely find the most intense of the people in animosity toward the believers [to be] the Jews and those who associate others with Allah; and you will find the nearest in affection to the believers to be those who say, ‘We are Christians.’ That is because among them are priests and monks, and because they are not arrogant.”—Al-Maaida (5:82)Thus, Muslims are told that Jews are their primary enemies. Friendship with Jews is prohibited (Al-Maaida 5:51). True awakening requires understanding that you are not justified in labeling Christians as infidels merely for acknowledging Jesus as the Son of God.Faith and SalvationBelief in Jesus as the Son of God brings eternal life:John 3:16–17: “For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.”John 3:36: “Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not believe the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.”Muhammad warned of God’s wrath because he did not know the fate of his own soul regarding the Kingdom of God. But the Bible clearly teaches that acknowledging Jesus as the Son of God is the path to salvation, not disbelief:Maryam 19:88–90: The Quran exaggerates the reaction to this truth as if the heavens would split and the mountains collapse. This hyperbole demonstrates that calling Jesus the Son of God is not truly infidelity.Therefore, awaken today, Muslim reader, and recognize that believing Jesus is the Son of God does not make one an infidel.Max Shimba Ministries Org",

We read:عَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُ قَالَ : قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ ((اسْتَأْذَنْتُ رَبِّي أَنْ أَسْتَغْفِرَ لأُمِّي فَلَمْ يَأْذَنْ لِي ، وَاسْتَأْذَنْتُهُ أَنْ أَزُورَ قَبْرَهَا فَأَذِنَ لِي )) مسلمReported by Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Prophet (peace be upon him) said:“I asked my Lord for permission to seek forgiveness for my mother, but He did not permit me. I asked for permission to visit her grave, and He permitted me.” (Muslim)It is explained in the book ‘Awn al-Ma’bud:“His statement ((but He did not permit me)) means (his mother) was an unbeliever, and it is not allowed to seek forgiveness for an unbeliever.”This is yet another calamity for Muslims. The parents of Muhammad both died with great sins and as UNBELIEVERS.Why did this Allah hate Muhammad’s parents so much?Do you know that Muhammad’s father also died an UNBELIEVER and is in Hell?Indeed, there are many strange things in Islam.BUT WE DO NOT READ THAT THE MOTHER OF JESUS DIED IN SIN.MUHAMMAD CONFESSES THAT HIS FATHER IS IN HELLThis is a HUGE CALAMITY for Muslims. Muhammad’s father, named Abdullah (meaning “servant of Allah”), is confirmed to be in Hell/burning in the fire.These are not my words nor am I slandering Muhammad’s father; these are the words of Muhammad himself.Read the evidence here:It is reported by Anas:A man said, “Messenger of Allah, where is my father?” He said, “In the Fire.” When the man turned away, he called him back and said, “Verily, my father and your father are in the Fire.” (Sahih Muslim, Book 001, Number 0398).The question Muslims should ask themselves is: why was Muhammad’s father, a pagan, named ‘Abdullah’?And since ‘Abdullah’ means ‘servant of Allah’, it is clear evidence that pagans during the time of ignorance (Jahiliyyah) used to worship Allah, to the point that they named their children in honor of Allah—just as the Jews would name their children in honor of the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.For example:Joshua – Yahweh is salvationJotham – Yahweh is perfectJehoahaz – Yahweh has heldHezekiah – Yahweh strengthensElisha – God is salvation, etc.The answer is clear: Allah was a pagan god worshipped before Islam came. This god was the “moon god,” known as “al-ilah.” Another name for him was “Hubal.” This pagan god was worshipped throughout the Middle East, not just by the Arabs.MOREOVER,Why does Muhammad admit his father is in Hell?Where did this Abdullah/Abdallah get the name that contains Allah?Does this mean Allah, a pagan god, existed before Muhammad?And that is why Muhammad’s father, Abdullah, was nearly sacrificed by Muhammad’s grandfather, Abdul Muttalib. Abdul Muttalib wanted to sacrifice his son as an offering to Allah. But Abdullah’s uncle saved him, and instead, 100 camels were sacrificed. And it should be noted that this sacrifice took place at the Kaaba (which we will discuss further later).We are told:The arrow showed that Abdullah was to be sacrificed. Therefore, Abdul Muttalib took the boy to the Kaaba with a razor to slaughter him. The Quraish, his uncle from the Makhzum tribe, and his brother Abu Talib tried to dissuade him. They suggested he consult a female diviner. She instructed that divining arrows be drawn between Abdullah and ten camels… finally, the number of camels reached one hundred. (Ibn Hisham 1/151-155; Rahmat-ul-lil’alameen 2/89, 90).That’s why the God of the Bible warned the Israelites so much about the pagan practices of the nations around them, especially regarding worship of the star family or the host of heaven. For example, He says:“And beware not to lift up your eyes to heaven and see the sun and the moon and the stars, all the host of heaven, and be drawn away and worship them and serve them, those which the LORD your God has allotted to all the peoples under the whole heaven.” (Deuteronomy 4:19)“If there is found among you, within any of your gates which the LORD your God gives you, a man or a woman who does evil in the sight of the LORD your God, in transgressing His covenant, and has gone and served other gods and worshipped them, either the sun or moon or any of the host of heaven, which I have not commanded...” (Deuteronomy 17:2-3)“He rebuilt the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he erected altars for Baal, made an Asherah as Ahab king of Israel had done, and worshipped all the host of heaven and served them.” (2 Kings 21:3)“He built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.” (2 Kings 21:5)“He removed the idolatrous priests whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah and in the places all around Jerusalem, and those who burned incense to Baal, to the sun, to the moon, to the constellations, and to all the host of heaven.” (2 Kings 23:5)“And they will spread them out before the sun and the moon and all the host of heaven, which they have loved, and which they have served, and which they have gone after, and which they have sought, and which they have worshipped. They will not be gathered or buried; they will be as dung on the face of the earth.” (Jeremiah 8:2)“...and the houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah shall be defiled like the place of Topheth—all the houses on whose roofs they have burned incense to all the host of heaven, and poured out drink offerings to other gods.” (Jeremiah 19:13)“...and those who worship the host of heaven on the housetops, and those who worship and swear oaths by the LORD but who also swear by Milcom...” (Zephaniah 1:5)In the year 570 AD, the very year Muhammad was born, there was a ruler of the Aksumite empire of Ethiopia who was stationed in Yemen. He was called Abrahah al-Ashram. It is said he was envious of Mecca because of the many people who made pilgrimage (a pagan pilgrimage), so he built a great church in Sana’a, Yemen, hoping to attract pilgrims, but they did not come.As a result, he decided to invade Mecca to destroy the Kaaba. He traveled with his army atop many elephants—hence, that year became known as the “Year of the Elephant.”The Quraysh clans united to try to save the Kaaba. Abdul Muttalib (Muhammad’s grandfather) told people to hide in the mountains while he and some others stayed near the Kaaba.But because of the size and power of Abrahah’s army, Abdul Muttalib said:“The Owner of this House will defend it, and I am sure He will save it from the enemy's attacks and will not allow His servants to be humiliated.”Tradition says that as Abrahah approached the Kaaba, a large flock of birds appeared, pelting the army with stones until they were wounded. Thus, Abrahah’s mission failed, and he returned wounded.Now, the question is, if at that time Muhammad was still an infant, Islam had not yet started, and at the Kaaba there were hundreds of pagan gods, who was the “Owner of the House” Abdul Muttalib spoke of?It is clear this was a pagan god, the moon god, worshipped and served by Abdul Muttalib—meaning the “moon god.”An even bigger question is that the Quran says in Surah Al-Fil (The Elephant) 105:1-5:“Have you not considered how your Lord dealt with the companions of the elephant? Did He not make their plan go astray? And He sent against them birds, in flocks, Striking them with stones of hard clay, And He made them like eaten straw.”The question is:These events took place before Islam, in the time of paganism. The servant of the pagan god, Abdul Muttalib, said the Owner of the House would defend it.So, who was the Owner of the House mentioned by Abdul Muttalib, and who is the Lord mentioned by the Quran in this surah? Or should we say there were two gods working together to throw stones at Abrahah and his elephants?Abdul Muttalib did not know the Allah of Muhammad, so in any case, he could not have mentioned him (if indeed the Allah of Muhammad was different from that of Abdul Muttalib).All the evidence shows that the moon god worshipped by Abdul Muttalib is the one who protected the Kaaba from Abrahah’s elephants. Therefore, this Quranic verse cannot claim to refer to a god different from that one!Therefore, the Kaaba is a pagan house.Therefore, the father of Muhammad is in Hell.Therefore, all Muslims who go on pilgrimage will enter Hell.Therefore, Allah is a pagan god.Indeed, Islam is a religion of pagans; that is why Muhammad admitted that his father is in Hell.I invite you to the Most High, the Living God, JESUS OUR SAVIOR.God bless you all.It is I, Dr. Maxwell Shimba, servant of Jesus Christ,For Max Shimba Ministries Org,MAX SHIMBA MINISTRIES ORG ©2016.

Ibn 'Abbaas (Radhiya Allaahu 'anhuma) also said about this verse: \"It refers to songs and foolish words.\" [Authentic Isnaad from Shaykh Al-Albaaniy].SINGERS/LISTENERS OF MUSIC WILL BE TURNED INTO MONKEYS AND PIGSThe Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “There will be among my ummah people who will consider illegal sexual intercourse, the wearing of silk, the drinking of alcoholic drinks, and musical instruments as lawful. And some people will stay near the side of a mountain and their shepherd will come in the evening with their sheep and ask them for something, but they will say: ‘Return to us tomorrow.’ Allah will destroy them during the night and will let the mountain fall on them, and He will transform the rest of them into monkeys and pigs until the Day of Resurrection.” [Al-Bukhaari]This hadith confirms that all these sins are equally forbidden. Just as adultery and alcohol are haram, music is also haram in the same way.So, how can a Muslim see music as not being a major sin to avoid?Imaam Abu Haniyfah said: \"Singing (songs, dancing) is among the major sins that a Muslim should avoid quickly.\" A Muslim should be more fearful of potentially facing the punishment of being transformed into monkeys or pigs for such sins, as warned in the following hadith:The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “There will be among my ummah people who will drink alcohol, calling it by another name, and music will be played for them and female singers will sing for them. Allah will cause the earth to swallow them, and He will turn them into monkeys and pigs.” [Ibn Maajah and authenticated by Shaykh Al-Albaaniy]SORRY TO MUSLIMS BECAUSE ALLAH DOES NOT LIKE TAARAB MUSIC OR BONGO FLEVA MUSICShalom,Dr. Max Shimba, a servant of Jesus Christ, the Great God.

    "full_content": "Tuesday, December 20, 2016. Arethe claims that the Quran is straightforward and clear really true?Allah sends down verses and claims that the Quran is not complete and not clear.Allah says that some verses in the Quran—no one knows their meaning except Allah.Dear readers,Today we will look at the confusion that fills the Quran, which many scholars claim is straightforward, while Allah Himself contradicts them and sends down verses saying that the Quran is not straightforward and is not clear.First, let’s start by looking at the verses that say the Quran is clear and its verses are explained as guidance for those who are guided.Surat HUD (11:1)Alif Lam Ra. This is a Book whose verses are set clear, then explained in detail, from One Who is Wise and All-Aware.Surat Al An’am (6:114)Shall I seek a judge other than Allah, while He it is who has sent down to you the Book explained in detail? Those unto whom We gave the Book know that it is revealed from your Lord in truth, so be not you of the doubters.Surat An-Nahl (16:89)And (warn of) the Day when We will raise up from every nation a witness against them from amongst themselves; and We will bring you as a witness against these. And We have sent down to you the Book explaining everything, a guidance, mercy, and glad tidings for Muslims.The above verses claim that the Quran is clear and its verses are explained in detail. This means that, when reading the Quran, you should not have questions or find confusion in the verses revealed by Allah.BUT THESE CLAIMS CONTRADICT THE CONFUSION FOUND IN THE FOLLOWING VERSE, WHICH CLAIMS THAT THERE ARE VERSES IN THE QURAN WHOSE MEANING IS KNOWN ONLY TO ALLAHLet’s read that verse:Surat Al Imran (3:7)He it is Who has sent down to you the Book; in it are verses that are precise—they are the foundation of the Book—and others ambiguous. As for those in whose hearts is deviation, they follow what is ambiguous of it, seeking discord and seeking its interpretation. And no one knows its interpretation except Allah. But those firm in knowledge say, \"We believe in it. All [of it] is from our Lord.\" And none will be reminded except those of understanding.Dear brothers and sisters, this is another disaster in Islam. In Surat Al Imran, which was revealed in Medina, Allah says:i. Within the Quran there are “muhkam” (precise) verses whose meaning is clear;ii. There are also allegorical verses which those who follow seek discord and search for their meaning;iii. There are verses whose meaning no one knows except Allah.Friends, this Surat 3:7 contradicts Surat HUD 11:1, Surat Al An’am 6:114, and Surat An-Nahl 16:89, which claim that the verses of the Quran are clear and explained in detail.So, which should Muslims follow?What do Muslims believe in this Quran that contradicts itself and is not clear?Why does Allah contradict Himself in these verses above?Or was the problem Muhammad, who could neither read nor write and failed to memorize Gabriel’s instructions?Furthermore, why did Allah reveal verses whose meaning only He knows?How do these verses benefit a Muslim?What benefit do Muslims get when reading these verses, knowing that their meaning is known only to Allah?Finally, I’d like to understand: how do Muslims know that the verses they read are the ones they are supposed to understand, knowing that Allah set a trap by saying there are verses in the Quran whose meaning only Allah knows?Perhaps this is why Muslims fight among themselves, like ISIS, Sunni vs Shia, etc.Maybe that’s why the Quran needs the help of Sahih Hadith and the Sunnah of Muhammad.This is another disaster in the religion of Allah.Why did Allah reveal verses that only He understands?Welcome to Jesus, the living One, who brought us the Holy Spirit as our Guide.John 16:13-15But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide you into all the truth. He will not speak on His own; He will speak only what He hears, and He will tell you what is yet to come. He will glorify me because it is from me that he will receive what he will make known to you. All that belongs to the Father is mine. That is why I said the Spirit will receive from me what he will make known to you.John 16:26But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you.1 John 2:27As for you, the anointing you received from him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about all things and as that anointing is real, not counterfeit—just as it has taught you, remain in him.Dear readers, Jesus has already made it clear that if you follow Him, you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit, and that same Holy Spirit will live within us and will teach us all things.Come to Jesus.God bless you all.Max Shimba Ministries@February 9, 2015http://www.maxshimbaministries.org/…/kumbe-quran-imejaa-sha…",

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteTuesday, December 20, 2016IntroductionThis is a grave matter within the nation of Muhammad. Christians have often wondered: Where did sorcery originate, and who was its author? Today, the Quran responds, declaring that sorcery was created and revealed by Allah. Consequently, Muslims are considered the primary practitioners of sorcery. You may think that I, Max Shimba, am unjustly accusing Muslims, but let us reason together.It is important to clarify that idolatry is an evil practice that leads to destruction. Consulting sorcerers and diviners is a manifestation of unbelief and idolatry. Let us examine the evidence from the Quran.Qur’anic EvidenceSurat Taha 20:73\"Indeed, we have believed in our Lord that He may forgive us our sins and the magic to which you compelled us. And Allah is the best and most enduring.\"According to the translation and commentary by Sheikh Ali Muhsin Al-Barwani, this verse asserts that Allah compelled the people to practice sorcery. This, indeed, is a tragedy, my brethren. One must ask: Since when has God become a sorcerer? What benefit is there in the sorcery revealed by Allah to Muslims?Another interpretation of Surat Taha 20:73 by Sheikh Ali Muhsin states:\"For indeed, we stand firm in faith, believing in our true Lord, so that He may absolve our past sins and forgive us for engaging in the sorcery you compelled us to learn and perform! And our Lord is superior in recompense and His sovereignty endures more than yours.\"From these interpretations, the following points emerge:Muslims are compelled to learn sorcery.Muslims are compelled to practice sorcery.Therefore, it is evident from the Quran that Allah revealed sorcery and compelled Muslims to both learn and practice it.A Pastoral WarningI advise Christians with Muslim friends to exercise caution, for your friend may be compelled by Allah to practice sorcery against you.Analysis of Quran 2:102I now quote Quran 2:102 and its commentary from two renowned scholars—Sheikh Abdullah Saleh Al-Farsy and Sheikh Ali Muhsin Al-Barwani:Quran 2:102\"And they followed [instead] what the devils had recited during the reign of Solomon. It was not Solomon who disbelieved, but the devils disbelieved, teaching people magic and that which was revealed to the two angels at Babylon, Harut and Marut. But they [i.e., the two angels] do not teach anyone unless they say, 'We are a trial, so do not disbelieve [by practicing magic].' And [yet] they learn from them that by which they cause separation between a man and his wife. But they do not harm anyone through it except by permission of Allah. And the people learn what harms them and does not benefit them. But the Children of Israel certainly knew that whoever purchased the magic would not have in the Hereafter any share. And wretched is that for which they sold themselves, if they only knew.\"Sheikh Abdullah Saleh Al-Farsy’s Commentary:He explains that the devils taught people magic, which was sent down to the two angels Harut and Marut in Babylon. However, these angels did not teach anyone without warning that they were a test from God, and that practicing magic is an act of disbelief. Importantly, the magician cannot harm anyone except by Allah’s permission, and the magician himself suffers the consequences of his practice.Sheikh Ali Muhsin Al-Barwani’s Commentary:He states that the devils attributed their magic to the reign of Solomon, yet Solomon did not disbelieve, but the devils did, teaching people magic and that which was revealed to Harut and Marut. These angels would only teach after warning of the test, and the lessons would cause harm, not benefit. Those who chose this path would have no share in the Hereafter.Relevant Hadith EvidenceAccording toSahih Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 54, Hadith 490, and Volume 7, Book 71, Hadith 658, Prophet Muhammad himself was bewitched and suffered from sorcery. This incident is further discussed in the Tafsir of Sheikh Abdullah Saleh Al-Farsy (pages 977–978).Theological Questions RaisedIf sorcery is disbelief (kufr), what is the relationship between Allah and disbelief that He would reveal sorcery?Was Prophet Muhammad bewitched by Muslim sorcerers or others?Was the sorcery that affected Muhammad the same as that revealed to the angels by Allah, or was it different?Is there any other prophet who was bewitched and affected by sorcery as Muhammad was?Biblical PerspectiveThe Bible is clear regarding sorcerers:1 Samuel 15:23\"For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the Lord, He also has rejected you from being king.\"All sorcerers will enter hell (Gehenna), according to the Bible.Final ExhortationDear reader, accept Jesus Christ, the Living One, and receive eternal life. Religion alone will not save you, for now you understand that it is religion that leads one into sorcery and away from the love of God.May God bless you abundantly.By Dr. Maxwell Shimba,Servant of Jesus Christ,For Max Shimba Ministries OrgMAX SHIMBA MINISTRIES ORG ©2016.

I only follow that which is revealed to me, and I am only a clear warner.”Today, we have evidence from Muhammad himself that he is nothing, and that Islam is not of any value.Sorry to the followers of this so-called unique prophet, as he himself admitted and confessed that he does not know what will happen to him after death. Perhaps this is why he said in the hadith below that all sects will enter Hellfire. So, Muhammad will enter Hellfire. So, Muslims will enter Hellfire.Hadith:“The Jews split into seventy-one sects, and the Christians split into seventy-two sects, and my Ummah will split into seventy-three sects. All of them will enter Hellfire…”[Ahmad, Abu Dawood, at-Tirmidhi, and ad-Daarimi]As the evidence says above that all sects will enter Hellfire, now, which is the sect that will not enter Hellfire?Shalom,Dr. Maxwell ShimbaServant of Jesus ChristShimba Theological InstituteTheological and Scholarly Expansion1.Context of Surat Al Ah’qaaf 9Surat Al Ah’qaaf 46:9 states:Say, “I am not a new thing among the Messengers, nor do I know what will be done with me or with you. I only follow that which is revealed to me; I am but a clear warner.”Islamic InterpretationClassical Islamic Scholarsgenerally interpret this verse as a statement of Muhammad’s humility and his role as a prophet who is strictly bound to the revelations from Allah.Tafsir Ibn Kathir:The verse is interpreted to mean that Muhammad is not different from previous messengers, nor does he claim independent knowledge about the ultimate fate of any individual, including himself, except what has been revealed by Allah.Al-Tabarisimilarly explains that the Prophet is emphasizing that he does not possess divine knowledge of the unseen (al-ghayb), which is a trait reserved for Allah alone.Christian and Critical Academic PerspectiveCritical scholarssee this verse as indicative of theuncertainty and human limitationof Muhammad’s role, contrasting sharply with the claims of some Muslims about his intercessory power or unique status.Christian apologistsoften point to this verse to argue that Muhammad himself expressed uncertainty regarding his salvation, which contradicts the certainty of salvation offered through Jesus Christ in the New Testament (e.g., John 14:6, 1 John 5:13).2.The Hadith on Sectarianism“The Jews split into seventy-one sects, the Christians into seventy-two, and my Ummah will split into seventy-three sects. All of them will be in the Fire except one…”[Sources: Ahmad 8492, Abu Dawood 4597, at-Tirmidhi 2641, ad-Daarimi 2517]Islamic ContextThemajority of Islamic scholarsinterpret this hadith as a warning against division and an encouragement to adhere to the Prophet’s example (Sunnah) and the consensus of the community (Jama'ah).The “one group” that will be saved is interpreted differently across sects: Sunni scholars claim it is the Ahl as-Sunnah wal-Jama'ah, while various other sects (e.g., Shia, Sufis) have their own interpretations.Christian and Academic ReflectionChristian theologians see this as evidence of doctrinal uncertainty within Islam, in contrast to the New Testament's teaching on the assurance of salvation for believers in Christ.Sociologists of religionnote that such hadith reflect early Islamic struggles with internal division, mirroring the splits in Judaism and Christianity, but also serve to legitimize certain interpretations over others.3.Theological ReflectionFrom a Christian PerspectiveSalvation and Assurance:Christianity, especially in the Pauline and Johannine tradition, affirms that believers can be assured of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ (John 3:16, Ephesians 2:8-9). This stands in contrast with the ambiguity presented in Muhammad’s admission in the Qur’an and the hadith regarding the fate of his followers.Finality of Revelation:The Christian doctrine maintains that the fullness of God’s revelation and salvation is in Christ, who not only declares but guarantees eternal life (John 14:6, 1 John 5:11-13).From an Islamic PerspectiveDivine Sovereignty:Islam teaches that ultimate judgment belongs to Allah alone. Even prophets are not exempt from divine scrutiny, and ultimate knowledge of each soul’s destiny rests with God (Qur’an 31:34).Humility of Prophets:Muhammad’s statement is seen as a sign of prophetic humility and submission to Allah’s will.Academic SpectrumComparative Religion:Scholars recognize that both Islam and Christianity have traditions about division and “saved” communities, but they handle assurance of salvation differently. Where Christianity (especially Protestant traditions) leans toward assurance, Islam underscores the necessity of hope and fear, leaving final judgment to God.Sectarianism:Both religions experienced early and enduring divisions, yet both preserved canonical traditions emphasizing unity and orthodoxy.ConclusionThe statement in Qur’an 46:9 and the hadith about sectarian division invite deep theological reflection on authority, certainty, and salvation. While Islamic tradition sees these verses as emphasizing God’s ultimate authority and the necessity of following revelation, critical and Christian perspectives see in them a lack of assurance that only the Gospel of Christ fulfills.The crucial question remains:Which path truly leads to salvation and certainty in the life to come?For Christians, the answer is found in Christ alone, the only one who guarantees salvation and eternal life. For Muslims, hope is placed in God’s mercy, but the door remains open and uncertain.Shalom,Dr. Maxwell ShimbaServant of Jesus ChristShimba Theological Institute",

The sun, moon, and the five retrograde stars revolve in the depths of the waves of the sea. Thus is the word of God (as it means): “Each one swims in a circle.” “Circle” is a circular course in the depths of that sea.’ (al-Tabari, Volume 1, p. 235)Comments from the early Muslims:They said that the sun actually goes to a place of rest at night, and that the sun and moon actually “float” in a sea of water in the sky.Shalom,Dr. Maxwell Shimba, servant of Jesus Christ.",

What or who is the source?Without wasting time, let's begin reading Muslim books.IF MUHAMMAD WAS BORN WITH SATAN, PLAYED WITH BY SATAN, WHY DO YOU FOLLOW HIM?HIS BIRTH,Abu Huraira (r.a) narrated that \"Prophet Muhammad (s.a.w) had Satan from the time he was born.\" (Fat'hul Baary Vol. 6 Pg. 389).From the proof we read above, we have learned that Muhammad was born with the power of demons, and that is a very bad beginning since we have no verse or hadith that says Muhammad was freed from these demons when he was given prophecy by a strange creature.Surprisingly, Muhammad was given prophecy by a strange creature that choked him until he struggled and saw stars. Read the proof below.AFTER LEAVING THE CAVE, MUHAMMAD CONFESSES THE FOLLOWING,So the Prophet was frightened, returned to his wife, told her, and immediately a high fever struck him. He wanted to be covered with clothes, trembling severely, and he was scared, saying, \"I fear for myself, being played with by demons, ruining my mind and deceiving me.\" (The Life of the Prophet Muhammad, pg. 17, written by Sheikh A. Farsy).You have read for yourself and understood that the act of Muhammad being choked until he struggled in this way surely did not come from the God of Adam, Abraham, Moses, and other Prophets of the Bible. There is not a single verse in the Holy Bible that says His prophets were choked by angels; instead, we read that all the prophets in the Bible were given prophethood by God Himself and not by a strange creature who gave Muhammad prophethood at night in a cave.MUHAMMAD BEING BEWITCHED,Aisha, the wife of the Prophet, said, \"A Jew named Labiid bin Al'answan bewitched the Prophet Muhammad, and sometimes the Prophet would become confused and start calling out aimlessly.\" (Sahih Muslim Vol. 4 Pg. 38-39)DOES IT MEAN THAT GOD COULD NOT FIND SOMEONE ELSE TO SEND EXCEPT MUHAMMAD WHO WAS PLAYED WITH BY DEMONS?THIS IS A GREAT TRAGEDY FOR MUSLIMS, BECAUSE NOW WE KNOW THAT MUHAMMAD WAS NOT ONLY BORN WITH DEMONS BUT WAS ALSO ADDED TO BY BEING BEWITCHED.Although there is no verse or hadith that says Muhammad was freed from demons, it is not wrong to acknowledge that Muhammad died with demons in his heart, and therefore his end is hellfire.The tragedy continued later, even the writer of the Quran was possessed by demons.My friends, why don't Muslims read their own books?DID THE WRITER OF THE QURAN HAVE A DEMON?READ:The first person to learn reading and writing in the city of Mecca was Mr. Harb bin Umayya, the grandfather of Mr. Muawiya. He learned from the people of Yemen and then taught those who wanted to learn in Mecca.When the Prophet received prophethood, there were only six people in Mecca who knew how to write. Four of them entered Islam and became the scribes of \"Wahyi\" (Quranic verses). These people were Sayyidna Abubakar, Sayyidna Umar, Sayyidna Uthman, and Sayyidna Ali. (The Life of the Prophet Muhammad, pg. 8, by Sheikh A. Farsy)SAYYIDNA ABUBAKAR,Abubakar said, \"Surely I have a demon that visits me from time to time, so whenever it comes to me, avoid me.\" (Tabaqatul Kubra, Vol. 3 Pg. 212)NOW, IF THE \"QURAN\" WAS WRITTEN BY A PERSON WHO HAD A DEMON, WHY SHOULD WE NOT ACCEPT THAT THESE ARE VERSES FROM SATAN?Dear reader, I urge you to be careful with Islam because there is nothing good there except demons everywhere. From Muhammad, the Quran, to their Allah, all have confirmed that Satan is in their hearts.So why follow Satan when the Great God exists and loves you?JESUS IS THE ONLY WAY TO SALVATION. ALLAH IS NOT THE WAY. MUHAMMAD IS NOT THE WAY. THE QURAN IS NOT THE WAY.Jesus is the only way to salvation because He alone can pay the penalty for our sins (Romans 6:23). No other religion teaches the depth and seriousness of sin and its consequences. No other religion pays the penalty for sin except Jesus alone. No other \"religious founder\" had God become human (John 1:1, 14) - the only way to pay the debt. Jesus had to be God so He could pay our debt. Jesus had to become human so He could die. Salvation is found through faith in Jesus Christ! “Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved” (Acts 4:12).Have you made a decision for Christ based on what you have read here?Make sure you understand the meaning of salvation.1 John 5:13 tells us, \"I have written these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know that you have eternal life.\" God wants us to understand the meaning of salvation. God wants us to have confidence in knowing for sure that we are saved. Let's briefly go over the key aspects of salvation:(a) We have all sinned. We have all done things that are displeasing to God (Romans 3:23).(b) Because of our sins, we deserve to be punished by being separated from God forever (Romans 6:23).(c) Jesus died on the cross for our sins (Romans 5:8; 2 Corinthians 5:21). Jesus died in our place, taking the punishment that we deserved. His resurrection proved that Jesus' death was sufficient to pay for our sins.(d) God offers forgiveness and salvation to all who believe in Jesus – trusting His death as the payment for our sins (John 3:16; Romans 5:1; Romans 8:1).Those are the details of salvation! If you have placed your faith in Jesus as your Savior, you are saved! All your sins are forgiven, and God promises never to leave you or forsake you (Romans 8:38; Matthew 28:20). Remember, your salvation is secure in Jesus Christ (John 10:28-29). If you believe in Jesus alone as your Savior, you can be confident that you will spend eternity with God in heaven!God bless you all,I am Dr. Max Shimba, a servant of Jesus Christ, the GREAT GODFor Max Shimba Ministries Org,MAX SHIMBA MINISTRIES ORG ©2016.

    "full_content": "Tuesday, November 29, 2016Muhammad’s Insult and Curse Against an Orphan: An Interfaith Perspective on Ethical SpeechIntroductionReligious texts and traditions play a pivotal role in shaping the moral and ethical outlook of their adherents. The teachings of both Islam and Christianity strongly emphasize compassion, kindness, and the sanctity of speech—particularly toward the vulnerable in society, such as orphans. However, historical and scriptural records sometimes reveal instances where even revered figures are portrayed in ways that challenge contemporary ethical expectations. One such instance is recorded in Islamic sources, where the Prophet Muhammad is said to have insulted and cursed an orphan child. This episode invites critical reflection not only on the figure of Muhammad but also on the ethical standards upheld by the world’s major religions.The Incident as Reported in Islamic TraditionTheSahih Muslimcollection, regarded as one of the most authoritative compilations of Hadith in Sunni Islam, records an event in which the Prophet Muhammad insulted and cursed an orphan who was in the care of Umm Sulaim, the mother of Anas ibn Malik (Sahih Muslim, Book 32, Hadith 6297). The implications of this narration are significant, given the high esteem in which orphans are generally held within the Qur’anic and Prophetic traditions, and the explicit warnings against mistreating them (Qur’an 93:9–10).The Universal Prohibition of Abusive SpeechIslamic PerspectiveIt is noteworthy that the ethical teachings of Islam strongly prohibit the use of abusive or insulting language. The Prophet Muhammad himself is reported to have stated:“Indeed, a true believer is neither a slanderer, nor one who curses others, nor is he indecent or foul-mouthed.”(Musnad Ahmad, Volume 1, Page 416, Hadith Number 3948)This hadith underscores the foundational Islamic virtue of speaking kindly and refraining from verbal abuse, cursing, or slander. The Qur’an itself commands believers to “speak to people good words” (Qur’an 2:83), and repeatedly extols those who restrain their anger and forgive others (Qur’an 3:134).Christian PerspectiveChristian ethics similarly maintain a high standard for speech and interpersonal conduct. The Apostle Paul, addressing the church in Ephesus, instructs:“Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, clamor, and evil speaking be put away from you, with all malice.”(Ephesians 4:31, NKJV)This call is echoed throughout the New Testament, as followers of Christ are admonished to build others up through their words (Ephesians 4:29) and to imitate the humility and gentleness of Christ himself (Philippians 2:5).The Consequences of Abusive Speech: Divine JudgmentBoth traditions warn of divine judgment for those who persist in abusive language and conduct.Islamic WarningsDespite the troubling hadith in Sahih Muslim, the wider corpus of Islamic teachings presents a consistent warning against cursing and slander. The Prophet Muhammad is often depicted as embodying patience and mercy, especially toward children and orphans. Muslims are instructed to follow these ethical standards, with the understanding that God is both Just and Merciful, and that “whoever does an atom’s weight of evil will see it” (Qur’an 99:8).Christian TeachingsThe Apostle Paul is unequivocal in his warnings regarding the eternal consequences of unrepentant sin, including verbal abuse:“Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers [abusive talkers], nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.”(1 Corinthians 6:9–10, ESV)This stern admonition underscores that verbal abuse—categorized here as “revilers” or those who insult—can disqualify a person from inheriting the Kingdom of God if not repented of.Ethical and Interfaith ReflectionsThe incident recorded in Sahih Muslim raises important questions about the application of religious teachings and the moral accountability of religious leaders. Both Islamic and Christian traditions agree: insults, curses, and abusive language are antithetical to authentic faith. The episode serves as a reminder for all believers to scrutinize their own speech, attitudes, and actions—especially towards the marginalized and vulnerable, such as orphans.In interfaith dialogue, these common ethical imperatives can serve as a foundation for mutual respect and moral accountability. As religious communities, we must uphold and promote the values of kindness, respect, and compassion in both word and deed.Conclusion and BenedictionLet us be reminded that knowledge is to be shared with respect and humility. The teachings of the great faith traditions converge on the principle that our words have the power to bless or to harm, to build up or to destroy. May we all strive to embody the highest ideals of our faiths, treating every human being with dignity and love.May God bless you all.Dr. Max Shimba,Servant of Jesus Christ, the Great God (cf.

    "full_content": "Tuesday, November 29, 2016Insults Among Muslims: A Sacred Ritual According to the Late Muhammad?An Academic and Theological CommentaryMax Shimba Ministries OrgIntroductionThis commentary seeks to address the phenomenon of verbal abuse and the use of insults within certain religious communities, focusing specifically on the Islamic tradition as referenced in hadith literature. The analysis draws upon both Islamic sources and Christian perspectives, with the aim of fostering an informed and respectful discussion on the matter. The commentary concludes with recommendations for a Christian response, grounded in the teachings of the Gospel.Insults in Islamic TraditionIt is not uncommon for Christians to encounter derogatory remarks or insults from some Muslims concerning matters of faith. To better understand this phenomenon, we turn to primary Islamic sources.Abu Huraira (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said:“Whoever is given to insulting others, indeed Satan has whispered into his mouth.”(Fat'hul Baari, Volume 10, Page 176)This narration clearly indicates that, within the Islamic tradition, the act of insulting others is regarded as the result of satanic influence. According to this hadith, those who insult others are viewed as being under the sway of Satan, who uses their mouths as instruments for his own purposes.Additional Islamic ReferencesFurther examination of Islamic sources reveals additional references to Satan's influence in the daily lives of believers. For example, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is reported to have said:“Satan comes to one of you during prayer and blows (whispers) into his posterior, causing the person to think that he has passed wind, even though he has not. In such a case, he should not leave his prayer unless he hears a sound or perceives an odor.”(Kitabu cha Mkweli Mwamiu, Volumes 1–2, Hadith No. 74, p. 42)This narration underscores the belief that Satan is not only involved in provoking insults but also actively seeks to distract and mislead believers during their acts of worship. There are additional mentions in Islamic tradition suggesting that Satan may reside in the nostrils of Muslims or otherwise seek to disturb their bodily functions during prayer.The Christian ResponseFrom a Christian theological standpoint, the occurrence of insults and verbal abuse—interpreted here as evidence of spiritual bondage—should not surprise believers. Instead, it is viewed as a call to respond with evangelistic zeal and intercessory concern. Christians are urged not to retaliate, but rather to persist in sharing the message of the Gospel (Injil) with those engaged in such behaviors, in the hope that they may awaken spiritually and become liberated from what is perceived as satanic influence.Thus, the Christian response is characterized not by animosity or surprise, but by a sense of mission and compassion. The ultimate aim is transformation—bringing those considered spiritually lost into the freedom and grace offered through the Gospel of Jesus Christ.Implications and Christian DutyIn light of the aforementioned Islamic references, this commentary concludes that Christians bear a significant responsibility to present the Gospel to Muslims, whom the author describes as being under spiritual bondage due to these influences. The hope expressed is that, through receiving the Gospel, such individuals may be delivered from negative spiritual influences and cease to be \"instruments\" or \"playthings\" of Satan.ConclusionWhile this reflection is admittedly polemical in its approach, its purpose is to highlight what are perceived as spiritual dynamics at play in certain interreligious encounters. The Christian is therefore encouraged to approach such situations not with hostility, but with a sense of spiritual mission, seeking the transformation and liberation of those believed to be lost, through the power of the Gospel.Author's NoteThe above is a scholarly translation and contextual arrangement of the original Swahili text. The content reflects the theological and polemical position of the author and should be approached with sensitivity and an appreciation for the principles of interfaith dialogue.

They resort to insults because their mouths are filled with the words of Satan. Satan expands his rear and leaves flatulence in their mouths, making them insult without shame. This evidence is stated by Muhammad himself, the prophet of the Muslims.MUSLIMS HAVE BEEN INFLUENCED BY SATAN IN THEIR MOUTHS:Abu Huraira (r.a) narrated that: The Prophet (s.a.w) said, \"Anyone who insults, it is because Satan has influenced his mouth.\" (Fat'hul Baary Vol. 10, Pg. 176)Therefore, our fellow Muslims are under the influence of Satan. We should not be too surprised by this but rather continue to preach the Gospel to them, so they may awaken and stop being influenced by Satan in their mouths, as Satan has a strong hold on them. Besides influencing their mouths, Satan also settles in their nostrils.SATAN SLEEPS IN THE NOSTRILS OF MUSLIMS:Abu Huraira (r.a) narrated that the Prophet (s.a.w) said, “When one of you wakes up from sleep, let him wash his nose by putting water in it and then blowing it out three times, because Satan has spent the night in the upper part of his nose.” (Bukhari, Hadith No. 516, Vol. 4)BUT SATAN DOES NOT JUST INFLUENCE THEIR MOUTHS AND SLEEP IN THEIR NOSTRILS; he also enjoys playing games by blowing on the buttocks of Muslims.The Prophet (s.a.w) said, “Satan comes to one of you in prayer and blows on your buttocks, making you think that you have released wind when you did not. If you experience this, do not leave your prayer unless you hear a sound or smell something.” (THE BOOK OF SINCERE MUSLIMS, VOL. 1-2 HADITH NO. 74, PG. 42)Therefore, we Christians have a great responsibility to deliver the Gospel to these slaves of Satan, the Muslims, so they can stop being influenced by Satan in their mouths, stop being his beds, and stop being used as his playthings through their buttocks.MUHAMMAD INSULTS AND CURSES AN ORPHANProphet Muhammad insulted and cursed an orphan who was with Umm Sulaim (the mother of Anas). (Sahih Muslim, Book 032, Number 6297)SHARE KNOWLEDGE WITHOUT INSULTS!Remember, all religions prohibit insults!ISLAM:Muhammad said: \"A true believer does not accuse others, nor curse others, nor use vulgar language.\" {Musnadu Ahmad Vol. 1 Pg. 416, Hadith No. 3948}CHRISTIANITY:(Ephesians 4:31) - \"Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, clamor, and evil speaking be put away from you, with all malice.\"THERE IS JUDGMENT FOR THOSE WHO INSULT!(1 Corinthians 6:9-10) - \"Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor sodomites, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God.\"God bless you all.I am Dr. Max Shimba, a servant of Jesus Christ, the GREAT GODFor Max Shimba Ministries Org,MAX SHIMBA MINISTRIES ORG ©2016.

    "full_content": "Dear reader:Some Muslims claim that the Quran contains scientific truths about the movements of the sun, moon, (and sometimes planets). I would like to examine this issue, and we will explore various aspects before drawing a conclusion. However, the fundamental point is: unless a Muslim interprets these verses metaphorically, these verses do not confirm or prove the scientific accuracy of the Quran.Surah 36:37-40 states, “And a sign for them is the night: We withdraw therefrom the day, and behold, they are plunged in darkness; 38 And the sun runs its course for a period determined for it; that is the decree of (Him), the Exalted in Might, the All-Knowing. 39 And the moon – We have measured for it mansions (to traverse) till it returns like the old (and withered) lower part of a date-stalk. 40 It is not permitted for the sun to catch up to the moon, nor can the night outstrip the day: each (just) swims along in (its own) orbit (according to law).” (Yusuf Ali’s translation, first edition) [Words in brackets are in the brackets in the translation.]Some Muslims say that “the sun runs its course for a period determined” and the word “orbit” is placed at the end. However, we cannot say much about the “orbit” of the sun because Yusuf Ali’s translation has a reference (note 17) at the bottom of the page related to this word saying “course, path.” Also, Yusuf Ali's revised edition says “resting place” instead of “period.”How Some Muslims Interpret the Quran Freely?The Sufi websitehttp://www.sufi.co.za/modern_science_and_islam.htmgoes to the extent of saying:\"All these objects, the earth, the moon, and all the planets at all times move in their orbits (or axes) in floating\" (Ansari).It adds the words \"(all these are planets)\" and \"(or their axes)\" in brackets, because they are not in the Arabic text. Let’s leave this as a misinterpretation and ask, \"What does Surah 36:37-40 really teach?\" It could be one of these three things:Orbits of the Sun and Moon: The Quran teaches that the sun and moon travel continuously on their orbits around the earth for a fixed period.Swimming to a Resting Place: The sun swims through the clouds during the day, heads to its resting place at night, and returns to its place where it was the previous morning. Similarly, the moon swims on its path.Metaphors: Like the previous part, but this is meant as a description of how things appear, not how they actually are.Let’s Go Back to the ArabicOrbit/Path: Yusuf Ali explains the Arabic word in question in reference 3983 at the bottom of page 1326. He says, “Mustaqarr may mean: (1) a period determined or a term appointed, as in vi. 67, or (2) a resting place or a place of repose; or (3) a dwelling place, as in ii. 36. I think the first meaning is the best here; but other commentators prefer the second. In that case, the comparison would be to the sun running a race while it appears to us, and resting during the night to prepare for the renewal of the race the next day. Its resting together with the other side of the world appears to us as a period of rest.”Moving/Swimming/Orbiting: yasbahuna can mean to hasten, although its more direct meaning is to swim.Swim/Orbit: Renowned Islamic commentator Ibn Taymiyyah (died in 1328 AD) wrote, “The sun, stars, and planets are round (istidaaratul-aflaak) – as is the statement of the astronomers and mathematicians (ahlul-hay’ah wal-hisab)..... [The word] falak [in Arabic] means something round” (Majmu’ul-Fatawa volume 6, pp. 566-567).It’s Not a “Scientific Miracle” That the Sun and Moon Are “Falak” Becausea) The word for ‘the earth revolving around the sun’ in Arabic is not falak but mahrek.b) The word falak did not originate in the Quran; it was a borrowed word from a foreign language.One person contributed the following: “The origin [of Arabic -- falaka] … from an ancient Semitic root we find [Akkadian -- pilakku]; [Hebrew -- pelek]; [Arabic -- falkatun], all meaning a rapidly moving circle, and another different origin [of Arabic -- falakun]; [Ethiopian -- falaka] meaning the other half of the sky. Therefore, etymologists have traditionally sought to relate [the Arabic word -- falkun] to this root, thinking that it was called so due to its circular shape.”Also, the word falak was used by the Arabs before Muhammad’s birth to mean the floating of the sun, stars, and planets on the “round celestial dome.” People living before and during Muhammad's time believed that the universe followed an Aristotelian/Ptolemaic model where the earth was at the center surrounded by seven circular domes (spheres). The sun, stars, and planets were believed to move in these circles, or the circles themselves were thought to move in a single path. Since the Quran mentions that there are seven heavens, it shows Muhammad’s view of the “astronomical system” resembled the Ptolemaic and Aristotelian model, which was believed to be true in that historical period.My Opinion (For Now):Although the Arabic word is not completely clear, these words do not describe anything that people before Muhammad’s birth had not already said.However, if we assume that Muhammad and his early followers did not understand the Quran (a safe assumption), and that the scientific views of the Quran are accurate, we have two ways to reach an appropriate conclusion. First, what did the early Muslims say about this, and second, what does the rest of the Quran say?What Did Muhammad and Early Muslims Say About the Sun?Where would you go to find the correct meaning of the Quran? Zamakhshari? al-Tabari? Baidawi? If you were an early Muslim, you could go to Muhammad himself! Hear how Muhammad explained, according to Bukhari and al-Tabari.\"Abu Dhar reported: The Prophet asked me at sunset, 'Do you know where the sun goes (at sunset)?' I replied, 'Allah and His Apostle know best.' He said, 'It goes (i.e., travels) till it prostrates itself underneath the Throne and takes the permission to rise again, and it is permitted and then (the time will come when) it will be about to prostrate itself but its prostration will not be accepted...' \"Bukhari volume 4 book 54 chapter 4 number 441 page 283.Another translation of the same Bukhari passage says: **\"Abu Dharr Ghifari (ra) narrated: Once Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) asked me, 'Abu Dharr do you know where the sun sets after setting?' I replied, 'I don't know, only Allah and His Prophet can tell better.' Then Prophet (SA) replied, 'After setting, the sun remains prostrated under the Aro’sh (Allah's throne) and waits for Allah's order to rise again in the east. The day will come when the sun will not be allowed to rise again and Qiyamah (the Day of Judgment) will come upon the earth.'\"**Al-Tabari volume 1 page 231 states, \"I asked the Messenger of God [Muhammad] 'Where does [the sun] set?' He replied: 'It sets in the heaven and then rises from heaven to heaven until it rises from the highest heaven, the seventh heaven. Finally, when it is beneath the Throne, it falls prostrate and the angels in charge of it prostrate with it. Then the sun says, My Lord, where do you command me to rise, where I set or where I rose? He continued. This is (meant by) the word of God: 'And the sun runs on to a resting place for him [this is] the decree of [Him] the Exalted in Might, the All-Knowing' while it is held under the Throne - 'that is the decree of the All-Mighty, the All-Knowing' - the Lord of his Kingdom, the Lord who 'knows' His creatures. He continued, Gabriel brings a garment from the Throne’s light to the sun according to the measure of hours and days. It is longer in summer and shorter in winter and of medium length in spring and fall. [The styles of spring, fall, and winter!] He continued, the sun wears this garment, as one of you wears his garment. Then it is free to circulate in the firmament of heaven until it rises from its rising place. ... The same way is followed by the moon during its rising ... But Gabriel brings the garment from the light of the feet. This is the meaning of the word of God, 'He made the sun a shining light and the moon a light.'\"The sun and the moon are Allah's signs.Abu Dawud volume 1 book 2 number 1173 page 304; Sunan Nasa’i volume 2 number 1462, 1464 page 272; volume 2 number 1465, 1466 page 273; volume 2 number 1475 page 278; volume 2 number 1477 page 280; volume 2 number 1481 page 283; volume 2 number 1485-1486 page 286-287; volume 2 number 1488-1489 page 287, 289; volume 2 number 1500 page 297; volume 2 number 1502 page 299; volume 2 number 1505 page 300; volume 2 number 1506 page 301.Dhu al-Qarnaiyn [Zul Qarnain] \"saw the sun setting in a spring of muddy water.\"al-Tabari volume 5 pages 173-174 (See Surah 18:82-97).Al-Tabari volume 1 page 234 also states that the sun sets in a spring of mud. The phrase \"muddy spring\" is hami’ah, meaning dark mud, but hamiyah is a similar word meaning hot.(See reference 442 below page 234).**\" [Muhammad] continued. When the sun rises, it rises on a chariot (drawn by horses) from one of those springs accompanied by 360 angels .... When God wishes to test the sun and moon, to show His servants a sign and thereby command them to stop disobeying Him and start obeying Him, the sun suddenly collapses from its chariot and falls into the depth of the sea, which is circular. When God wishes to increase the significance of the sign to terrify His servants more, the entire sun falls, and none of it remains in its chariot. This is a complete solar eclipse, during which the day turns to night and stars appear.\" al-Tabari volume 1 page 236.What Do Muhammad and Early Muslims Tell Us About the Heavens?The Prophet [Muhammad] said: ‘Ali, there are five stars: Jupiter (al-birjis), Saturn (zuhal), Mercury (utarid), Mars (Bahram), and Venus (al-zuhrah). These five stars rise and run like the sun and moon and compete with them. All other stars are suspended from the heavens like lamps hung in mosques...\"al-Tabari volume 1 pages 235-236.\"God created a sea three fasrakh (18 kilometers) from the heavens. The waves are controlled, standing in the air by God's command. Not a single drop spills. All seas do not move, but the sea runs with the speed of an arrow. It is left to travel in the air in equilibrium, as if it were a rope pulled in a region between east and west. The sun, moon, and stars revolve in the depth of the waves of the sea. This is what the word of God means: ‘Each one swims in a circle.’ ‘Circle’ is the course of the chariot drawn by horses in the depth of the sea.\"al-Tabari volume 1 page 235.Opinions of Early Muslims:The sun actually goes to a resting place at night, and the sun and moon \"swim\" actually in the sea of water in the sky.What Do Other Parts of the Quran Say?Understand that verse numbers vary in different editions of the Quran. The following verse numbers are from (the revised edition of) Yusuf ‘Ali. I have corrected the use of capital letters.Surah 20:53“He Who has made for you the earth like a carpet spread out”Surah 50:7“And the earth - We have spread it out4946, and set thereon mountains standing firm …”Yusuf Ali's note 4946 at the bottom of the page says, \"Compare xiii. 3; and xv. 19 and note 1955. The earth is round, but it looks flat like a vast expanse of land, like a carpet held firmly by the weight of the mountains.\" So whether you believe that this verse claims the earth is flat or not, Yusuf Ali says this verse states that the earth appears as a flat carpet.Surah 67:15“It is He who has made the earth manageable5571 for you...” Other translations use the word \"smooth.\" Yusuf Ali's note 5571 at the bottom of the page says, \"Zalul is used in ii.71 for a trained and manageable animal: here it is used to describe the earth, and I have translated it as ‘manageable’….”Surah 71:15“‘Do you not see how Allah has created the seven heavens one above another ‘And made the moon a light in their midst, and made the sun a lamp.’” Even if taken as metaphorical, there is nothing here suggesting modern astronomical teachings.Surah 71:19“‘And Allah has made the earth for you like a carpet (spread out),5718…” Yusuf Ali’s note 5718 at the bottom of the page says, \"compare xx 53.Surah 78:6-7“Have We [Allah] not made the earth as a wide expanse5890, and the mountains as pegs?” Yusuf Ali’s note 5890 at the bottom of the page says, \"See note 2038 to xvi. 15. Compare also xiii. 3 and xv. 19. A wide expanse like a carpet, on which mountains are placed as pegs ….\"Zul-Karnain in Surah 18 and AstronomySurah 18:85-86\"He [Zul-Qarnain] followed a path, until, when he reached the setting of the sun, he found it set in a spring of black muddy (or hot) water: near it he found a people: We [Allah] said: 'O Zul-Qarnain! (thou hast authority) either to punish them or to treat them with kindness.'\" The word \"murky\" is also translated as \"black water\" and \"muddy.\" The phrase \"spring of ... water\" is also translated as \"spring.\" M. H. Shakir translates it as \"black sea.\"Surah 18:89-90\"Then he [Zul-Qarnain] followed another path, until, when he came to the rising of the sun, he found it rising on a people for whom We had provided no shelter from the sun.\"Islamic commentators differ on who exactly Zul-Qarnain (the man with two horns) was. Some think he was Alexander the Great, others think he was Cyrus the Persian, and still others think he was a Yemeni king. However, it does not matter. Whatever the case, Zul-Qarnain was able to go to the actual place where the sun sets. This fact confirms the Quranic view that the earth has a flat shape. More importantly, he went to the place where the sun sets and found it setting in a muddy, murky spring.If you ask astronomers if the sun sets in a muddy spring, they will tell you \"no.\"Conclusion: The Quran teaches the following:The earth is flat, spread out like a carpet, and held down flat by pegs that are mountains.The earth has its own orbit set for a period during the day, then sets in a muddy, murky spring at night and goes to Allah’s throne.The sun later rises from a particular place.Except for the five retrograde planets, stars are hung like lamps.Muhammad taught the early Muslims this as literal truth, not as a metaphor or analogy.The Purpose of Stars and Meteors\"The lowest heaven is adorned with lamps [stars], and 'We have made such lamps as missiles to drive away the evil ones, and have prepared for them the punishment of the blazing Fire.'”Surah 67:5.\"The creation of these stars is for three purposes, namely, to adorn the sky, as missiles to hit the devils, and as signs to guide travelers. Therefore, if anyone tries to seek any other interpretation, he is mistaken and is wasting his efforts...\"Bukhari volume 4 book 54 chapter 3 before number 421 page 282.Sometimes meteors are thrown at devils who try to listen to heavenly secrets. Sahih Muslim volume 1 book 4 number 902 and note 674 below page 243.Meteors should strike the bad angels before they can spread what they heard. Ibn-i-Majah volume 1 book 1 number 194 page 110.Meteors attack jinn (genies) Sahih Muslim volume 4 book 24 number 5538 page 1210.Stars guard against the devil. al-Tabari volume 1, page 223.Muhammad Splits the Moon in Two\"The pagans requested the Prophet to show them a miracle, so he showed them the moon split into two halves.\"Bukhari volume 4 book 56 chapter 26 and number 831, page 533.\"Ibn 'Abbas reported: The moon was split into two halves during the lifetime of the Prophet.\"Bukhari volume 4 book 56 chapter 26 and number 832, page 534.The splitting of the moon. Bukhari volume 6 book 60 chapter 225 and number 290, page 273 and note 1 below page 273; volume 6 book 60 chapter 287 and number 387-391, pages 365-366; volume 6 book 60 chapter 261 and number 345, 349, page 331; Bukhari volume 6 book 60 chapter 265 and number 368-370, pages 331, 336.\"The splitting of the moon Sahih Muslim volume 4 book 37 number 6721, 6724-6730, pages 1467-1468.\"Surah 54:1 states, \"The Hour (of Judgment) is nigh, and the moon is cleft asunder.\"(revised edition of Yusuf ‘Ali).Note that the splitting into two means the moon was split in half, and the verb used here is in the past tense. We have no records of any other people in the world, including their neighbors in Egypt, Syria, or Persia, who saw the moon split in two. The Quran and hadith do not explain how the moon could return to one piece again.Yusuf ‘Ali, in reference note 5128 at the bottom of the page, says, \"Three explanations are offered in the Mufradat, and perhaps all three are applicable here: (1) that the moon appeared cleft asunder in the valley of Mecca in the presence of the Prophet, his Companions, and some Unbelievers; (2) that the past tense in Prophetic vision indicates the future, the cleaving asunder of the moon being a Sign of the coming Judgment; and (3) that the phrase is metaphorical, meaning that the matter has become plainly clear as the moon. The first cleaving was witnessed by the Unbelievers, as is evident from verse 2. The second cleaving will be the breaking up of the solar system at the New Creation: Compare lxxv. 8-9.\"Contradictory Examples in the Quran?Let's leave the previous verses and look at other verses in the Quran that some Muslims believe support modern astronomical principles. To be fair, here are the verses they use, along with their responses.Surah 7:54\"...He brings the night as a covering over the day, each seeking the other in rapid succession...\"Response: It is true that night and day follow each other, but this does not say anything about science or astronomy that the ancients did not already know.Surah 13:2a and Surah 31:10say that Allah raised the heavens without any pillars that you can see.\"Response: Although not all ancient people believed the heavens were held up by pillars, this simply states that God did not use any visible pillars.Surah 13:2b\"...And subjected the sun and the moon! Each one runs (its course) for a period appointed\"Response: That the sun and moon have regular courses was known even to ancient people.Surah 21:30\"Do not the Unbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were joined together (as one unit of Creation) before We [Allah] clove them asunder?\" Some Muslims see this as a foreshadowing of the Big Bang theory of creation.Response: The ancient Egyptians, Aryan Hindus, and others believed the heavens and the earth were joined together before being separated. Simply saying that the heavens and the earth were together (as halves) is akin to ancient myths and not the Big Bang theory of creation.Surah 21:33\"It is He who created the Night and the Day, and the sun and the moon: all (the celestial bodies) swim along, each in its rounded course.\" Yusuf Ali's note 2695 at the bottom of the page says, \"I have indicated, contrary to many Commentators, the metaphor of swimming implied in the original words...\"Response: The word for orbit in Arabic is not used here, and \"swimming\" does not necessarily suggest modern astronomical principles. The Quran mentions the sun and moon, not planets and stars, so it's incorrect to put (the sun, moon, stars, and planets) in brackets in the translation. The Quran does not say that anything moves in its own orbit in space except for the sun, moon, and the five retrograde planets (planets).Surah 21:104\"The Day that We roll up the heavens like a scroll rolled up for books (completed).\"Response: It's unclear how this is supposed to foreshadow modern astronomy, but Muhammad’s first wife understood that he heard the gospel from a Christian, and the Bible, in Revelation 6:14 and Isaiah 34:4, contains similar imagery. However, Christians generally do not attempt to align modern scientific principles with Revelation 6:14.Surah 22:65\"...He holds back the sky from falling upon the earth except by His leave...\" Yusuf Ali's note 2847 at the bottom of the page says the word samaa can mean (1) anything above, (2) the root, roof, (3) sky, heavens, (4) clouds or rain. He prefers the last meaning, though most authorities incline to interpret it as \"sky.\"Response: Therefore, while most authorities interpret the word to mean \"sky,\" it still aligns with the view of a flat earth. Thus, while we cannot definitively say this verse affirms a flat earth view, the unclear Arabic does not support the claim of modern scientific accuracy.Surah 25:61-62\"Blessed is He who placed the constellations in the heavens, and placed therein a Lamp and a Moon giving light. And it is He who made the night and the day to follow each other.\"Response: Calling the sun a lamp does not confirm modern scientific views. That night and day follow each other was known even to ancient people.Surah 27:88\"...the mountains that you see and think are firmly fixed will pass away like clouds...\"Response: The preceding verse mentions the final trumpet, so this context is about end times, not today.Surah 29:44says that the creation of the heavens and the earth is a sign for those who believe.Response: The creation of the heavens and the earth showing God's majesty is also taught in Psalm 8:1, 3, 5; Psalm 19:1-6. Muhammad knew about the Psalms (zubur) of David, so this is not new.Surah 31:29, Surah 35:13, Surah 36:37, and Surah 39:5all say that Allah merges the night into the day and the day into the night. They also say that the sun and moon each run their courses for a term appointed. Surah 55:5 also says that the sun and moon run on fixed courses.Response: Nothing here indicates modern astronomical knowledge. These were things even ancient people understood and observed. Simply stating truths already known to people does not confirm a book's scientific accuracy. However, repeating widely known facts does not establish that the Quran predicted modern scientific understanding.Surah 51:47,48\"With power and skill did We construct the Firmament: for it is We Who create the vastness of space.\" (Yusuf Ali). Other translations say \"as a canopy.\"Response: Simply saying that God spread out the heavens does not confirm the Big Bang theory. This concept is also mentioned in the Bible, Isaiah 42:5. But Christians do not use this to claim the Bible predicted the Big Bang theory.Surah 55:33mentions the bounds of the earth which humans and jinn (genies) cannot pass without permission.Response: The bounds of the earth do not provide modern geographic knowledge but may reflect mythical barriers or obstacles preventing travel to certain parts of the world. Similarly, the bounds of the heavens do not have much significance, except that Muhammad and Jewish traditions talk about seven heavens.Surah 71:15-16\"Do you not see how Allah created the seven heavens one above another, And made the moon a light in their midst, and made the sun a lamp?\" Some Muslims claim this means the seven layers of Earth's atmosphere (troposphere, stratosphere, etc.) are the seven heavens.Response: Apart from the similarity to Jewish traditions, calling the moon a light and the sun a lamp does not indicate modern scientific understanding. Additionally, if the seven heavens are the seven layers of the Earth's atmosphere, it would be incorrect to say the sun, moon, and stars are in the heavens.As an additional thought, although the Bible does not mention seven heavens, several Jewish traditions related to the Bible but not part of the canonical scriptures (Apocrypha) mention seven heavens: 2 Enoch 20:1; Martyrdom and Ascension of Isaiah 7:8; 9:1,6; 10:17; The Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs chapter 3.3. And 3 Baruch 11:1 mentions five heavens, though it does not say they are the only ones. So, even if it were a scientific miracle that Muhammad mentioned seven heavens, it would be an even greater miracle that older books also mentioned seven heavens.Surah 86:1-3\"By the sky and the Night-Comer; And what will explain to you what the Night-Comer is? It is the star of piercing brightness. (Just as Allah Almighty controls every star in their flock, in the same way) there is a guardian angel over every soul.\" (Malik)Some Muslims claim this teaches that the sun is a star.Response: Notice two things: a) the sun is not mentioned here, and b) all words in parentheses are additions in the English translation; they are not in the original Arabic text!Yusuf Ali's (revised) translation is more accurate here. \"By the sky6067 and the Night-Comer6068 (therein); And what will explain to you what the Night-Comer is? - (It is) the star of piercing brightness; - There is no soul but has a guardian over it.6069\"Yusuf Ali's note 606 at the bottom of the page says, \"…‘The star of piercing brightness’ is understood by some to be the planet Saturn, by others to be Sirius, or Pleids [Pleiades] or meteors. I think it is best to understand ‘Star’ in the general sense, as stars shine every night in the year, and their piercing brightness is more noticeable in a dark night.\"Some Interpretations Are Contrary to This World!Here are other Islamic interpretations recorded athttp://debate.org.uk/topics/history/interprt.htm. This site also has other good information.\"For instance, Muhammad Hanafi al-Banna discovered references to airplanes (Surah 17:1), artificial satellites (Surah 41:53), interplanetary travel (Surah 55:33), and the hydrogen bomb (Surah 74:33-38) (Jansen 1980:48).Thus, it was not surprising when people like Muhammad Kamil Daww wrote that the miracle of the 'scientific' statements in the Quran was greater than the miracle of inimitable eloquence. This demonstrated the truthfulness of Muhammad and, hence, the correctness of all statements in the Quran.Today, the most well-known person propagating the scientific interpretation is the French doctor Maurice Bucaille. In his book, \"The Bible, The Qur'an and Science,\" he tried to show how the Bible is unscientific while elevating the Quran using the same criterion.\"But Some Muslims Were More ReasonableIt is worth noting that some Muslims do not believe these interpretations. Some see these verses as merely describing what can be easily observed in the sky.Muhammad said: \"Refrain from speaking about me except for things that you know. Anyone who deliberately fabricates lies about me should prepare their place in hellfire. And anyone who interprets the Quran according to their own opinion should prepare their place in hellfire.\"Tirmiz EE, Tefsir 1, (2951) (contributed).\"Yes, We cast the truth against falsehood, and it destroys its brain, and behold, falsehood perishes! Ah! Woe to you for the (false) things you ascribe (to Us).\"Surah 21:19.If anyone deliberately fabricates lies about Muhammad, their place will be in hellfire.Abu Dawud volume 3 chapter 1372 book 19 number 3643, page 1036. Also Bukhari volume 2 book 23 chapter 33 number 378, pages 212-213.\"...And whoever says anything deliberately false against me [Muhammad], certainly their place will be in the (hell) Fire.\"Bukhari volume 8 book 73 chapter 109 number 217, pages 139-140.False testimony is equal to claiming that Allah has partners.Ibn-i-Majah volume 3 book 13 number 2372, page 414.Opinions of Muslims and Their ResponsesThe Quran anticipated modern science: The sun and the moon are in orbits and rotate on their axis (Surah 21:33; 36:27-40). The Quran also teaches the Big Bang theory of creation (Surah 21:30; Surah 51:47,48). The Arabic word falak means \"orbit.\" Astronomers tell us that the sun orbits around the center of our galaxy approximately every 250 million years. The Arabic word yasbahuna (derived from sabaha) means to revolve in its orbit.1Response: These are wishful interpretations for two reasons.The words are not clear: falak is an Arabic word meaning path, to continue on its course, and yasbahuna can mean to hasten, though its direct meaning is to swim.Muhammad clearly told us what it meant, and it means the sun and moon travel over the earth, riding a chariot in the sky.Again, there are two sources of what Muhammad said.\"God created a sea three fasrakh (18 kilometers) from the heavens. The waves are controlled, standing in the air by God's command. Not a single drop spills. All seas do not move, but the sea runs with the speed of an arrow. It is left to travel in the air in equilibrium, as if it were a rope pulled in a region between east and west. The sun, moon, and stars revolve in the depth of the waves of the sea. This is what the word of God means: ‘Each one swims in a circle.’ ‘Circle’ is the course of the chariot drawn by horses in the depth of the sea.\"al-Tabari volume 1 page 235.Abu Dhar reported: The Prophet asked me at sunset, 'Do you know where the sun goes (at sunset)?' I replied, 'Allah and His Apostle know best.' He said, 'It goes (i.e., travels) till it prostrates itself underneath the Throne and takes the permission to rise again, and it is permitted and then (the time will come when) it will be about to prostrate itself but its prostration will not be accepted...’”Bukhari volume 4 book 54 chapter 4 number 441 page 283. Sahih Muslim volume 1 book 1 chapter 73 numbers 297-300 pages 95-96 also provides detailed accounts of Muhammad’s conversation with Abu Dharr.The Quran describes the orbit of the sun near the center of our galaxy2Response: The sun does not have its own orbit in our galaxy. If the Quran was trying to teach modern science, it should have said that the sun, moon, earth, and retrograde stars (planets) revolve together in one orbit.Again, we know exactly what Muhammad meant because he told us, as recorded in Bukhari volume 4 book 54 chapter 4 number 441 page 283 and al-Tabari volume 1 page 235.The resting place of the sun means it shines on the other side of the earthAgain, we know exactly what Muhammad meant because he told us as recorded in Bukhari volume 4 book 54 chapter 4 number 441 page 283 and al-Tabari volume 1 page 235.The resting place of the sun means the complete destruction of the sun4Response: Any ordinary person reading this in any language would think it refers to periodic cycles, not complete destruction.Metaphorical language: The sun, moon, and stars are used as signs. These verses were not meant to support or deny modern science but were poetic descriptions, merely saying that Allah was involved with things that people could see.5Response: This view might be reasonable if it weren’t for the words Bukhari and al-Tabari wrote Muhammad said. If Bukhari and al-Tabari were wrong about this, then what criteria can we use to say they were right about anything?ConclusionSome Muslims (not all) attempt to use these verses to prove the scientific accuracy of the Quran. Unless you can find fault with this analysis, it would be intellectually dishonest to try to claim that this proves the scientific accuracy of the Quran. The truth is that some of these verses contradict what we know through modern science, perhaps unless you interpret them as poetic and metaphorical language. However, Bukhari and al-Tabari show that these verses were understood literally. The sun and moon swim in the sky over the earth.However, the most important thing in the world is not what you know but Who you know. What matters is not people’s theories but whether you follow what the true God has revealed. Every astronomical view until the nineteenth century had errors. Who is to say that in the future people will not say the same thing about our scientific view? The only way we can know the truth is through what God has revealed to us. We hope that God will reveal to us what we need to know and that He will preserve the meaning of His revelation.Bibliography: Translations of the QuranArberry, Arthur J. The Koran Interpreted.

    "full_content": "Sunday, October 16, 2016Controversy: The Noah of the Quran is Different from the Noah of the BibleDear Reader,Muslims often assert that the Quran is a comprehensive book that explains everything and is self-sufficient, claiming it is a revelation from Almighty God, while criticizing the Bible as not being from God. I will present two verses from the Bible and then two verses from the Quran, followed by a question.WHEN DID THE FLOOD OCCUR ACCORDING TO THE BIBLE?Genesis 7:6\"Noah was six hundred years old when the floodwaters were on the earth.\"The Bible, which is claimed not to be from God, states that Noah was six hundred (600) years old when the flood occurred. It also explains the years of Noah after the flood.Genesis 9:28\"And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.\"HOW OLD WAS NOAH WHEN HE DIED?Genesis 9:29\"So all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years; and he died.\"We are told by the Bible that Noah lived three hundred and fifty (350) years after the flood, and he died at the age of nine hundred and fifty (950) years. This is the total number of years Noah lived. Now let's turn to the Quran and then ask a question.WHEN DID THE FLOOD OCCUR ACCORDING TO THE QURAN?Quran 29:14-1514. \"And indeed We sent Noah to his people, and he stayed among them a thousand years less fifty years; so the flood overtook them while they were wrongdoers.\"15. \"But We saved him and the companions of the ship, and We made it a sign for the worlds.\"THE COMPLETE DISCUSSION:The Bible says that the flood occurred when Noah was 600 years old. The Quran says that the flood occurred when Noah was 950 years old, which corresponds to the age at which Noah died according to the Bible. The Bible says that Noah lived 350 years after the flood and died at the age of 950 years, which matches the age at which the flood occurred according to the Quran.QUESTIONS:According to the Quran, Noah was 950 years old when the flood came, while the Bible says he was 600 years old when the flood came and died at the age of 950. How many years did Noah live after the flood according to the 950 years mentioned at the time of the flood in the Quran?Or did he die in the same year of the flood, being 950 years old as stated in the Quran at the time of the flood?Note:Answers should be based solely on the Quran, the book claimed to be from God.

He was put to death in the body but made alive in the spirit. 19 After being made alive, he went and made proclamation to the imprisoned spirits.\"The Word of God says thatHis body was put to death, but His spirit was made alive. Therefore, we need not be surprised, because we understand that it was onlyHis bodythat died, butHis spirit did not die.Scripture teaches us thatGOD IS SPIRIT; hence, the one who was killed was only thebody, butHis spirit remained alive.1 Timothy 6:15–16\"Which God will bring about in his own time—God, the blessed and only Ruler, the King of kings and Lord of lords, who alone is immortal and who lives in unapproachable light, whom no one has seen or can see. To him be honor and might forever. Amen.\"The divine nature of Goddid not changewhen the “WORD” became flesh (John 1:1, 14). Instead, theWord united with humanity(Colossians 2:9). Therefore, thedivinity of Jesus Christ was neither corrupted nor changed. Moreover, Jesus was not just a man who had God within him or merely someone doing the work of God—absolutely not. Jesus isGod in the fleshand thesecond person of the Holy Trinity.The Bible tells us inHebrews 1:3:\"The Son is the radiance of God’s glory and the exact representation of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful word. After he had provided purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty in heaven.\"Therefore, thetwo natures of Jesus Christcannot beconfused or mixed(Eutychianism), nor can they bemerged into one single nature(Monophysitism). Thesetwo naturesare distinct and independent, and yet at the same time, they are united in the person of Jesus. This union is known as theHypostatic Union.FURTHER EVIDENCE OF THE TWO NATURES OF JESUSThe doctrine of theHypostatic Unioninvolves what theologians call thecommunicatio idiomatum(Latin for \"communication of properties\"). This doctrine teaches that thedivine and human attributesof Jesus are both fully present in theperson of Jesus Christ. This means thatthe human Jesushad the right to say,“He had glory with God the Father before the world began” (John 17:5),He claimed to have come from Heaven (John 3:13),And that He is present everywhere—omnipresent(Matthew 28:20).All of these claims aredivine attributes, and Jesus fully possessed them.One of the greatest mistakesnon-Christiansmake is failing to understand thatJesus had two natures. For instance, theJehovah’s Witnessesview Jesus only as ahuman being, denying His divine attributes. They often focus only on the verses that describe the humanity of Jesus while rejecting those that testify to His deity.On the other hand,Christian Scientistsmake the opposite mistake: they emphasize Jesus’ divinity andneglectHis humanity.There are many other verses thattestify to the deity of Jesus, including:John 10:30–33John 20:28Colossians 2:9Philippians 2:5–8Hebrews 1:6–82 Peter 1:1To understand Jesus properly, every teaching about Himmust address bothHis divine and human natures.These two natures are essential to who He is.That’s why inLuke 2:52, it says:\"And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.\"Yet, at the same time, He wasomniscient(all-knowing), as seen inJohn 21:17.Jesus is the Word of God who became flesh/human(John 1:1, 14).God bless you all.It is I,Dr. Maxwell Shimba,Servant of Jesus ChristFor Max Shimba Ministries OrgMAX SHIMBA MINISTRIES ORG ©2016.

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Servant of Jesus ChristDate:Monday, September 26, 2016Abstract:This article presents a biblical argument affirming that Jesus Christ is the ultimate and final Judge of all humanity. According to Scripture, Jesus will judge not only Christians but also Muslims, their prophet Muhammad, the jinn (supernatural beings in Islamic theology), and even Allah – who, from a Christian theological perspective, is not the true God. The message is a clarion call to all people, especially Muslims, to acknowledge Jesus Christ as Lord and Judge and to submit to His authority before the day of judgment.Introduction:One of the most critical questions of eschatology is:Who will judge the world?The Bible provides a clear and unambiguous answer:Jesus Christ is the appointed Judge of all humanity. This includes every man, woman, and spiritual being — Muslims, Muhammad, all jinns, and any being presumed divine by human traditions, including Allah as portrayed in Islamic theology.Biblical Evidence:Psalm 58:11“Then people will say, ‘Surely the righteous still are rewarded; surely there is a God who judges the earth.’”This passage affirms that God actively judges the earth, pointing toward divine justice through a personal Judge.Revelation 18:8“Therefore in one day her plagues will overtake her: death, mourning and famine. She will be consumed by fire, for mighty is the Lord God who judges her.”This verse confirms that judgment will come suddenly by the hand of the Lord who has been given authority to judge.John 5:22“Moreover, the Father judges no one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son.”Jesus Himself affirms that God the Father has delegated all judgment to Him, the Son — removing all ambiguity about who the final Judge will be.Matthew 25:31–32“When the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the angels with Him, He will sit on His glorious throne. All the nations will be gathered before Him, and He will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.”This passage reveals that Jesus, referred to as the “Son of Man,” will preside as Judge over all nations and people.Acts 10:42“He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that He is the one whom God appointed as judge of the living and the dead.”The Apostle Peter testifies to Jesus’ divine appointment as Judge over both the living and the dead.Romans 2:16“This will take place on the day when God judges people’s secrets through Jesus Christ, as my gospel declares.”The apostle Paul teaches that all human secrets will be judged through Jesus Christ, not any other deity or prophet.2 Timothy 4:1“In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and the dead, and in view of His appearing and His kingdom, I give you this charge.”Paul again affirms Jesus Christ’s role in judging all humanity.Conclusion:According to the consistent witness of Scripture,Jesus Christ alone is the appointed Judge of all creation— not Muhammad, not any prophet, not the jinn, and certainly not Allah as defined in Islamic doctrine. The Judge is Jesus, the Son of God, to whom all power and authority in heaven and on earth have been given.Therefore, the question to every reader, especially to Muslims, is:Why not accept Jesus now, before the Day of Judgment arrives?The one who will judge your soul is not Muhammad nor Allah — it isJesus Christ.Come to Jesus TodayHe is not just a prophet — He is your Savior, Lord, and Judge.Sincerely,Dr. Maxwell ShimbaServant of Jesus ChristShimba Theological Institute",

    "full_content": "Thursday, September 22, 2016This is one of the common questions asked by followers of Muhammad to Christians—and today I will provide the answer here.This question would only make sense if asked about a mere creature. For instance, if we said a certain man died, it would then be reasonable to ask, “While he was dead, who was taking care of his family?” That’s because such a question applies to human limitations—since a human being cannot be in more than one place at the same time.BUT GOD IS NOT A MAN! HE IS ALL-POWERFUL—ESPECIALLY THE GOD OF ABRAHAM, ISAAC, AND JACOB!First:This question is itself proof that the Allah worshipped by Muslims is not the Almighty God and lacks divine attributes. But before I offer the full answer, let me ask Muslims a question:HOW DOES ALLAH RUN THE WORLD IF HE HAS NEVER BEEN HERE ON EARTH?One attribute of God, which Allah lacks, isbeing present everywhere at once (omnipresence). This omnipresence is a divine attribute belonging to God alone. So, when Muslims ask how Jesus managed to run the world after dying, they expose their misunderstanding of God’s nature. Jesus Himself answers this in the Gospel of Matthew as follows:Matthew 18:20says:“For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I with them.”The attribute of being present everywhere at the same time is uniquely divine, yet Jesus claims it as His own. As seen in the verse above, wherever two or three gather in His name, He is present with them—regardless of where they are in the world. Whether they’re in Johannesburg, Cape Town, or Texas—Jesus is there. That’s the beauty of Jesus—He is God!Let’s continue to see what Scripture says about this inPsalm 139:Psalm 139:7–107 Where can I go from your Spirit? Where can I flee from your presence?8 If I go up to the heavens, you are there; if I make my bed in the depths, you are there.9 If I rise on the wings of the dawn, if I settle on the far side of the sea,10 even there your hand will guide me, your right hand will hold me fast.Here we see King David acknowledging that God is everywhere—you cannot escape His presence. It’s shameful that a Muslim would ask, “If Jesus died, who was managing the world?” Honestly, how can a rational person ask such a childish, earthly question? How can one compare God's capacity with that of a fragile human being? This is why I often sayAllah cannot possibly be the Almighty God, because his followers lack a divine understanding of what it means for God to be present everywhere.NOW, let me ask Muslims again: HOW DOES ALLAH MANAGE THE WORLD IF HE HAS NEVER BEEN ON EARTH?Answer me using scripture—not insults.Today, I’ve briefly explained thatJesus is omnipresent—He is present everywhere, regardless of your country or location. If you call upon Him, He answers and helps. To understand Jesus better, read the articlehttp://www.maxshimbaministries.org/…/asilia-mbili-ya-yesu-k…for further insights. Jesus isnot just a prophetas Muslims claim;He is far more—He is God!See more: http://www.maxshimbaministries.org/…/uthibitisho-10-kuwa-ye…When Jesus died, or when He was outside the human body,He was still God, becauseGod is Spirit and does not die. What died was the human body—not the Spirit, which continued to work. That’s why Jesus said, “Where two or three are gathered in my name, I am there.”But you’ll still find Muslims asking absurd questions like, “If Jesus is God, when He died, who was watching over the world?”Again, this question only makes sense when talking about a creature. If a human being dies, it’s reasonable to ask who is now taking care of his family. That’s because we’re talking about human limitations—but God is not bound by those limitations.HE IS GOD—HE CAN DO ALL THINGS—ESPECIALLY THE GOD OF ABRAHAM, ISAAC, AND JACOB!JESUS IS GOD—NOW AND FOREVER!HALLELUJAH!Reflect.

    "full_content": "A Critical Theological and Historical AnalysisBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIntroductionThe claim that Islam predates Muhammad and has been the original faith since Adam is central to Islamic theology. Islamic orthodoxy posits a universalist view: all prophets were Muslims, all past revelations are part of the continuum of Islam, and thus, Islam is as old as humanity itself.1Yet, this claim merits rigorous examination against the backdrop of ancient textual evidence, religious self-identification, and historical consciousness.This paper critically examines whether Islam, as a religious identity and doctrinal system, existed before Muhammad. Special emphasis is placed on primary sources, historical method, and direct engagement with major Islamic apologetic arguments.The Islamic Universalist ClaimThe Core AssertionMuslim theologians assert that \"Islam\" is not limited to the system established by Muhammad, but is instead the primordial faith of all genuine prophets and their followers.2The Quran itself declares:\"Indeed, the religion in the sight of Allah is Islam.\"(Quran 3:19)And regarding Abraham:\"He was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but a true Muslim (hanifan musliman), and was not of the polytheists.\"(Quran 3:67)Based on such verses, Muslims believe that Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, and Jesus all preached \"Islam\" and were \"Muslims.\"3Apologetic ArgumentIslamic apologeticsoften claims:The message of submission (Islam) is universal and found in earlier revelations.Practices such as ritual purity, prostration, and fasting are evidence of continuity between Islam and previous faiths.The Torah and Gospel were originally Islamic, though later corrupted.Methodological FrameworkCriteria for AnalysisPrimary Sources: Only documents demonstrably written before Muhammad (i.e., before the 7th century CE) will be considered.Terminological Evidence: Explicit use of \"Islam\" (الإسلام) or \"Muslim\" (مسلم) as religious identity.Doctrinal Substance: Beyond practices, doctrinal and theological content must reflect Islam as later defined.1. Textual Silence on \"Islam\" and \"Muslim\" Prior to MuhammadA. Hebrew Bible / Old TestamentNowhere in the Hebrew Bible do we find the term \"Islam\" or \"Muslim.\" Abraham is called the \"friend of God\" (Isaiah 41:8), a recipient of the covenant (Genesis 17), and the progenitor of Israel—not a \"Muslim.\" The central theme is covenant, not submission.4Even in post-exilic literature (e.g., Daniel, Ezra), the concept of \"Islam\" as later articulated is absent.B. New TestamentJesus and his followers never identify as \"Muslims\" or claim to follow a religion called \"Islam.\" Early Christians referred to themselves as members of \"the Way\" (Acts 9:2; 19:9, 23), and later as \"Christians\" (Acts 11:26). Paul explicitly refers to himself as a \"servant of Christ Jesus\" (Romans 1:1), not as a \"Muslim.\"5C. Second Temple and Greco-Roman LiteratureNo usage of \"Islam\" or \"Muslim\" is found in the Dead Sea Scrolls, Philo of Alexandria, Josephus, or any pre-Islamic Arabian inscriptions.6Jewish and Christian sects of the period—Essenes, Pharisees, Sadducees, Nazarenes, Ebionites—had well-defined self-identities, none of which included the terms or concepts later associated with Islam.2. The Argument from Shared PracticesIslamic apologetics often points to shared ritual practices—ablution, prostration, fasting—as evidence of pre-Islamic Islam. However, this argument is fundamentally flawed:Ablution: Ritual washing is central to Levitical law (see Leviticus 15), as well as to ancient Egyptian and Zoroastrian practice.7It does not define a religious identity.Prostration: Prostration is an ancient gesture of worship seen in Daniel 6:10 (Jewish), Matthew 26:39 (Christian), and in Hindu and Buddhist traditions.Fasting: Fasting predates Islam by centuries and is prominent in Judaism (Leviticus 16:29-31; Esther 4:16) and Christianity (Matthew 6:16-18).These practices are not unique to Islam, nor do they imply Islamic self-identity. Religious universals cannot serve as evidence for a specific faith.3. Doctrinal and Theological DistinctionsA. JudaismThe center of Jewish theology iscovenant(ברית,berit) and Torah obedience, not universal submission.8God is known as Yahweh, not Allah; the Shema (Deuteronomy 6:4) is the core confession, not the Shahada.B. ChristianityChristian faith revolves around theincarnation, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christand thenew covenant(Luke 22:20). Early Christians confessed \"Jesus is Lord\" (Romans 10:9), not \"there is no god but Allah, Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.\"C. IslamIslam, as established by Muhammad, is defined by the Five Pillars, the Quran, and the Sunnah. The doctrine oftawhid(absolute monotheism) and the prophethood of Muhammad are non-negotiable tenets unknown to previous revelations.94. Historical and Archaeological EvidenceNo archaeological inscription, manuscript, or papyrus prior to the 7th century contains reference to \"Islam\" as a religious system or to its followers as \"Muslims.\"10Pre-Islamic Arabia: Inscriptions reference gods like Hubal, Al-Lat, Al-Uzza, and Manat—not Allah in a monotheistic Islamic sense.11Christian and Jewish Writings: Non-Islamic sources do not recognize Islam or Muslims prior to Muhammad.5. Islamic Apologetics: Critical EngagementA. Retrojection and ReinterpretationIslamic polemics often retroject later concepts into ancient texts. For instance, calling Abraham a \"Muslim\" or claiming \"Islam\" means generic submission. However, historical-critical scholarship rejects such anachronisms, as self-identity in ancient texts is contextually bound.12B. Alleged Corruption of Previous ScripturesMuslim apologists assert that Jews and Christians corrupted their scriptures, hence the absence of explicit references to Islam.13However, textual criticism and manuscript evidence (Dead Sea Scrolls, Codex Sinaiticus, etc.) demonstrate remarkable fidelity in the transmission of biblical texts long before the advent of Islam.14There is no textual gap where \"Islam\" was erased or altered.C. \"Hanif\" and Primordial MonotheismThe termhanifin the Quran refers to pre-Islamic monotheists, often linked to Abraham. Yet, outside the Quran, there is no evidence that such a community called itself \"Muslim\" or that their faith matched Islam doctrinally or ritually.156. Summary Table: Key Figures and Self-IdentityFigureSelf-DesignationFaith/PracticePre-Islamic SourceAdamMan, created beingCovenant, not \"Islam\"Genesis 1–5AbrahamHebrew, Friend of GodCovenant, circumcisionGenesis 12–25MosesProphet of YahwehTorah obedienceExodus–DeuteronomyDavidKing, PsalmistCovenant, worship of YahwehSamuel, PsalmsJesusMessiah, Son of GodGospel, love, new covenantGospels, PaulNone referred to their faith as \"Islam\" or themselves as \"Muslim\" by any credible pre-Islamic text.ConclusionThe proposition that Islam, as a religious identity, existed prior to Muhammad is not supported by historical, textual, or archaeological evidence. All available sources point to Islam as adistinct, post-7th-century religious phenomenon.No use of the term \"Islam\" or \"Muslim\"in any pre-Islamic scripture.Shared ritualsare universal, not uniquely Islamic.Doctrinal substanceof pre-Muhammad faiths is distinct from later Islamic teaching.It is, therefore, both academically and theologically sound to affirm thatIslam is a man-made religion that began with Muhammad, not a timeless faith existing since Adam.To argue otherwise is to engage in retrospective reinterpretation, unsupported by the historical record.References and FootnotesFor Max Shimba Ministries OrgSeptember 02, 2016Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Shimba Theological InstituteIf you wish to include an annotated bibliography or interact further with Islamic polemical responses (for example, in dialogue form or debate context), let me know!FootnotesSee: Seyyed Hossein Nasr,Islam: Religion, History, and Civilization(HarperOne, 2003), pp. 17–19.↩W.

However, there exists a theological contradiction in that Muslims permit the consumption of camel meat and even camel urine and milk, despite these being explicitly prohibited in the Torah.The Torah’s Prohibition on the CamelInLeviticus 11:4, which outlines the dietary laws given by Yahweh (Jehovah) to Moses, the camel is classified as an unclean animal:“Nevertheless, among those that chew the cud or have divided hooves you are not to eat the camel, because it chews the cud but does not have a divided hoof; it is unclean for you.” (Leviticus 11:4)This biblical directive clearly declares the camel to be unclean and thus forbidden for consumption. If, as Islam claims, Allah is the same God who revealed the Torah to Moses, then why does Islam contradict this divine command by allowing Muslims to consume camel products?Contradictions in Islamic PracticeMuslims often highlight the prohibition of pork as a sign of religious purity. Yet, many consume animals such as camels, lizards, and hyenas—some of which are also considered unclean or detestable in Jewish law. The consumption of camel meat, in particular, contradicts the Torah.Further compounding this theological issue is the Islamic allowance—encouraged even by the Prophet Muhammad—for drinking camel urine and milk. Such practices would be considered an abomination according to the Torah’s purity laws.Hadith Evidence Supporting the Use of Camel Urine and MilkAccording to authentic hadiths, Muhammad permitted and even prescribed the drinking of camel milk and urine for medicinal purposes:Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 7, Book 71, Numbers 589 & 590 (pp. 398–399)Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 7, Book 71, Number 623 (p. 418)Ibn Majah, Volume 5, Book 31, Number 3503 (p. 38):\"Indeed, in the urine of camels there is healing.\"Sunan al-Nasa’i, Volume 1, Hadiths 308–309 (pp. 255–256)Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 52, Number 261 (p. 162)In one incident, Muhammad instructed a group of individuals to follow his camel herder and drink from the camels’ milk and urine as a cure. When some of them later rebelled and killed the herder, Muhammad ordered their hands and feet be cut off and their eyes gouged out—punishments that raise further ethical and theological questions.Scholarly Critique and Theological QuestionsThis raises an important question: if the Torah, believed by both Jews and Christians to be divinely inspired, prohibits the consumption of camels, how can Islam, which claims continuity with previous revelations, justify such a practice? If Muhammad and Allah permit what God once declared unclean, are they not violating the eternal law revealed to Moses?This is not a small matter. It calls into question the consistency and integrity of the Islamic claim to be a continuation of the Abrahamic tradition. It also raises significant doubts about the compatibility between the revelations of Moses and those attributed to Muhammad.ConclusionIn conclusion, the consumption of camel meat, urine, and milk—endorsed in Islam and by Muhammad himself—stands in direct opposition to the commandments in Leviticus. This contradiction exposes a major theological rift between the Judeo-Christian scriptures and Islamic teachings.We invite every seeker of truth to come to the living Jesus Christ—our eternal high priest and savior—who fulfills, not abolishes, the law of Moses.May God bless you all.In His Service,Dr. Maxwell ShimbaMax Shimba Ministries Org ©2016.

There is a profound difference between Muhammad and Jesus: Muhammad is dead, but Jesus lives today and will live forever and ever.Prophet Muhammad was born around 570 CE in the city of Mecca and died at the age of approximately 62 on June 8, 632, in Medina, present-day Saudi Arabia, where his tomb remains. In summary, Muhammad died, was buried, and his remains are still in his grave today.In contrast, Jesus was born around four years before the common era. He died on the cross around the age of 30 in Jerusalem. His body was placed in a tomb, but its current location is irrelevant, because God raised Him from the dead after three days! Forty days later, God took Him up to heaven, where He sits at the right hand of God on the throne.Jesus is alive today and will never die again! This is the fundamental difference between Muhammad and Jesus. Muhammad is dead, but Jesus lives today, eternally and forever.The Apostle John recounts:“When I saw Him (Jesus), I fell at His feet as though dead. But He laid His right hand on me and said, ‘Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last, and the Living One. I was dead, and now look, I am alive forever and ever! And I hold the keys of death and Hades.’” (Revelation 1:17-18)Here, Jesus claims that He is the First and the Last, implying that no one will come after Him. Therefore, the Islamic claim that Muhammad is the last prophet is erroneous, because no one comes after Jesus. He is the Alpha and the Omega—the Unique One.Comparing Jesus and Christianity with Muhammad and IslamJesus / ChristianityMuhammad / IslamJesus’ birth and life were foretold by over 300 prophecies.Muhammad’s birth was not prophesied by any scriptures.Jesus’ birth was miraculous, as even the Qur’an affirms.Muhammad was born like any ordinary man.According to Hebrews 4:15, Jesus “was tempted in every way, just as we are—yet was without sin.” He lived a sinless life.Muhammad was a sinner like all other humans. He lied, deceived, broke promises, and engaged in sexual immorality. The Qur’an never claims Muhammad was sinless.Jesus performed miracles, which were recognized even by his Jewish opponents (although they accused him of doing so by Satan’s power). These miracles affirmed his divine claims.Muhammad did not perform miracles, except for his claim of receiving the Qur’an as a revelation. There is little to substantiate this claim outside of his own words.Jesus is God.Muhammad was an ordinary man.Jesus lived out his teachings, exemplifying his doctrine in his own life, especially love.Muhammad preached and taught, but often failed to live up to his own teachings.Jesus committed no evil acts.Muhammad engaged in violence, killed his enemies, raided caravans, and plundered Bedouin tribes, taking spoils of war.Jesus never used violence to persuade anyone to follow his teachings. He said, for example, in John 7:17, “Anyone who chooses to do the will of God will find out whether my teaching comes from God or whether I speak on my own.”Muhammad often used violence to force people to become Muslims. Even the Qur’an speaks of violence against unbelievers.Jesus taught his disciples about love and truth. Nowhere in the Gospels did he instruct his followers to harm, kill, or rob anyone.Muhammad taught his followers to kill and rob in his name.Jesus was pure in thought, word, and deed.Muhammad had up to twenty wives and concubines, the youngest being nine years old.Jesus died for the sins of others.Muhammad died for his own sins, as any other human being.Jesus died for us.Muhammad killed others for his own benefit.Jesus foretold his own death and resurrection.Muhammad died suddenly and unexpectedly, with little preparation for his followers.Jesus rose from the dead, witnessed by many throughout the Bible. Paul writes in 1 Corinthians 15:6, “Then he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep.”Muhammad’s body decayed and remains in his tomb. Though there are later legends of Muhammad’s ascension, neither the Qur’an nor early Islamic traditions affirm this.Jesus never contradicted himself.Muhammad frequently changed his statements, sometimes praising Jews, other times condemning them. In the so-called “Satanic Verses” (later removed from the Qur’an), Muhammad momentarily affirmed the worship of Allah’s three daughters, then retracted it, becoming even more vehement against Christian claims about the Son of God.The Bible versus the Qur’anThe Bible consists of 66 books, written by about 40 different authors over several millennia. These writers came from every walk of life, from kings like David and Solomon to simple shepherds like Amos. Despite their vast differences in time, culture, and status, the Bible presents a unified message—God’s character, and what is right and wrong, is consistently clear throughout. Among these 66 books, there are hundreds of prophecies, including about 300 specifically concerning Jesus, which were fulfilled in detail in his life. There are also prophecies about Israel and neighboring nations such as Assyria, Babylon, and Persia, many of which have come to pass.All this serves as strong evidence of the Bible’s divine origin. As it says, “…for prophecy never had its origin in the human will, but prophets, though human, spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.” (2 Peter 1:21) Without the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, it is difficult to imagine how these diverse books could fit together so seamlessly, like pieces of a puzzle.The Qur’an, on the other hand, was written by one man over his lifetime. It contains no specific prophecies that can be verified. While it sometimes claims to affirm the Bible, it often contradicts or rejects key elements of the biblical narrative.www.maxshimbaministries.org",

    "full_content": "Friday, August 26, 2016IntroductionMuslims are often quick to tell others that God allowed the Bible to be corrupted. Their underlying claim is that the Qur’an, as it exists today, is a reliable word of God, unlike the Bible. While the Bible indeed has many variant manuscripts with minor differences, the evidence for doctrinal corruption is weak. In contrast, the Qur’an itself demonstrates significant evidence of alteration, according to sources such as Ubayy, abrogated verses, ‘Uthman’s recension, and other problems. However, perhaps the greatest doctrinal difference brought forth by Muslims themselves concerns the so-called “Daughters of Allah.”SummaryThe Christian websiteAnswering Islamstates:“One of the most embarrassing events in Muhammad’s life occurred when Satan inserted his words into Muhammad’s mouth, and Muhammad spoke Satan’s words as if they were from God. This incident has been recorded in Islamic literature by several early Muslim authors and is mentioned in both the Hadith and the Qur’an. Later Muslims, ashamed that their self-declared prophet spoke the words of Satan, have tried to deny that this event happened. Many excuses and denials have been made by these later Muslims to cover up the grave sin of Muhammad.”It is important to note that the event of the “Satanic Verses” is not a fabrication by non-Muslims. It is recorded in the oldest available Islamic sources, contemporary with Muhammad’s lifetime. No one should think this is a tale invented by critics of Islam; it is found directly in early Islamic records.This is one of the most controversial subjects within Islam. Satan caused Muhammad to utter his (Satan’s) words as if they were from God.What Did the Qur’an Say Originally?Surah An-Najm (The Star), Surah 53:19-20states:“Have you considered al-Lat and al-‘Uzza, and another, the third (goddess), Manat?”Allah was already famous in Arabia before Islam, known as a deity with three daughters: al-Lat, al-Uzza, and Manat (note that “al-” means “the” in Arabic). Four early biographers of Muhammad wrote that these verses were originally followed by:“These are the exalted cranes (intercessors) whose intercession is to be hoped for.”Interpretation:The Daughters of Allah were believed to be celestial beings who could intercede on behalf of others. The “exalted cranes” was a metaphor for them. Alternate translations for “to be hoped for” (“turtaja”) include “whose intercession is approved” (“turtada”). (From Alfred Guillaume’s translation ofThe Life of Muhammadby Ibn Ishaq, p.166.)Later, this passage was removed and replaced with:“Is the male for you and the female for Him? That, then, is an unjust division.” (Surah 53:21-22 today)Interpretation:Those who believed Allah had three daughters were unjust to Allah, preferring sons for themselves while attributing only daughters to Allah.These are the so-called “Satanic Verses.” In modern times, Salman Rushdie used this phrase in the title of his fictional novel, but this writing does not discuss the contemporary controversy. For the original Satanic Verses, how can any fair-minded person, Muslim or not, determine which verses were present originally? The remainder of this article provides direct and indirect evidence that the Satanic Verses were indeed present, as well as nine Islamic objections.The Four Early Biographers of Muhammad: Direct EvidenceWhile not everything early Muslims said about Muhammad is necessarily true, Islamic scholars generally accept things attributed to Muhammad that are confirmed by at least three sources. We know the Satanic Verses did not originate from non-Muslim sources but from four distinct early Muslim biographers. Notably, three of these authors wrote before the major Sunni hadith collections.1.Al-Wahidi/Waqidi(d. 207/823 CE) –Asbab al-Nuzul“One day, the chiefs of Mecca gathered beside the Ka‘bah and discussed their city’s affairs; Muhammad appeared and sat near them in a friendly manner, beginning to recite Surah 53. When he reached the verses: ‘Have you considered al-Lat, al-Uzza, and Manat, the third, the other?’ the devil suggested words of reconciliation he had long desired, placing in his mouth words eagerly awaited from God: ‘These are the exalted cranes, whose intercession is to be hoped for.’ The Quraysh rejoiced at this acceptance of their deities, and as Muhammad concluded the Surah, the entire gathering prostrated together. That evening Gabriel visited him and, after Muhammad recited the Surah, said, ‘What have you done? You recited to the people what I did not bring to you!’ Muhammad was grieved…”2.Ibn Sa‘d(d. 230/845 CE) –Kitab al-Tabaqat al-KabirIbn Sa‘d, familiar with al-Wahidi’s work, was himself a biographer and author of a 15-volume history.3.Ibn Ishaq(d. 145/767 or 151/773 CE) –Sirat Rasul Allah“[The emigrants] remained in [Ethiopia] until they heard that the people of Mecca had accepted Islam. This was because Surah An-Najm had been revealed and recited by Muhammad. A believer and a polytheist listened in silence as he said: ‘Have you considered al-Lat and al-‘Uzza?’ All listened intently; when believers heard the ‘satanic suggestion,’ some reverted to idolatry, saying: ‘By Allah, we will serve them so they may bring us closer to Allah.’ Satan taught these two verses to all idolaters, who grasped them easily. This distressed the Prophet until Gabriel visited and complained…” (Transmission chain: Yazid bin Ziyad → Muhammad bin Ishaq → Salama → Ibn Hamid → Ibn Ishaq)4.Ibn Jarir al-Tabari(d. 923 CE) –History of the Prophets and Kings, vol. 6, pp. 108-110“When the Messenger of God saw his people turning away, he wished in his heart for a revelation that would reconcile them. Upon reaching: ‘Have you considered al-Lat and al-Uzza, and Manat, the third, the other?’ Satan interjected, because of his inner deliberations, the words: ‘These are the exalted cranes whose intercession is to be hoped for.’ The Quraysh rejoiced, believing their gods were affirmed, and the Muslims, trusting their Prophet, did not doubt him. Later Gabriel came and said: ‘Muhammad, what have you done? You recited to the people what I did not bring to you…’”Other Early Islamic Scholars Who Mentioned This EventAbu Ma’shar of Khorasan (787–885 CE)Ibn Abi HatimIbn al-MundhirIbn Hajar al-Asqalani (773–852 CE)Ibn MardawayhMusa ibn ‘UqbaZamakhshari’s commentary on Surah 22:52 (1070–1143 CE)(Sources:The Book of the Major Classes, translated by S. Moinul ‘Haq)Indirect Evidence from the Qur’an and HadithSahih al-Bukhari(d. 870 CE) records that when Muhammad recited Surah An-Najm, both pagans and Muslims prostrated (vol. 3, book 19, nos. 173 & 176; vol. 6, book 60, nos. 385–386; Abu Dawud vol. 1, book 2, chapter 481, no. 1401). Pagans are not known to have prostrated for any other Qur’anic recitation. Why this one, unless the recitation included affirmation of their deities?Surah 22:52says:“We did not send before you any messenger or prophet except that when he desired, Satan threw [some suggestion] into his desire; but Allah abolishes that which Satan throws in, then Allah makes precise His verses.”Surah 17:73–75states:“They almost lured you away from what We have revealed to you, so that you would invent something else against Us; then they would have taken you as a friend. And if We had not strengthened you, you would almost have inclined to them a little. Then We would have made you taste double punishment in life and double after death. Then you would not find for yourself against Us a helper.”Note:Although some claim that Surah 17:73–75 was revealed during the “Isra and Mi’raj,” both Tabari and Ibn Sa’d state it was revealed around the time of the Satanic Verses. Muslims even have a specific word for satanic whispering, “waswas,” echoing this concept.Nine Common Muslim Objections and Scholarly ResponsesObjection 1:Only eleven early authorities mention the Satanic Verses; others, such as Imam Muslim, Abu Dawud, al-Nasai, Ahmad ibn Hanbal, and Ibn Hisham, do not.Response:Many hadiths are not found in every collection. For example, Bukhari contains long hadiths absent from Muslim. Ibn Hisham, who used Ibn Ishaq’s work, omitted the Satanic Verses section because he considered it problematic. If he was too embarrassed to include it, this omission is not proof of its non-occurrence.Objection 2:The alleged Satanic Verses do not fit with the rest of Surah 53.Response:The current text replaced the original, and parts of a surah were sometimes revealed at different times. We do not know if the entirety of Surah 53, post verse 22, was written at once. Verses 51–53 seem out of place, as they address Muhammad personally.Objection 3:Surah 53:19–21 may have been revealed before the verses about Satanic whisperings.Response:Tabari and Ibn Sa’d say they were revealed simultaneously with Surah 17:73–75. Exact timings are uncertain, but even if revealed earlier, this does not negate the content. If Muslims trust the Qur’an, including Surah 17:73–75 and 22:52, they must accept that Satan can insert words into revelation.Objection 4:The Satanic Verses contradict monotheism, which Muhammad consistently taught.Response:Muhammad is not shown to have been perfectly consistent. Bukhari (vol. 4, book 54, no. 490; vol. 8, book 53, no. 400) records he was bewitched for a time. These biographers were still Muslims, indicating that people followed Muhammad even if he erred.Objection 5:Many verses state that Muhammad could not speak falsely, so this story is incompatible.Response:The claim is that Satan, not Muhammad, produced the false verses. The Qur’an’s preservation does not preclude temporary satanic interference that is later corrected by God. Also, abrogation (nasikh) is a Qur’anic principle, with some verses lost after being abrogated (cf. Sahih Muslim vol. 1, book 244, no. 1433). Thus, the Qur’an’s textual preservation is debated.Objection 6:Tabari may have been an unreliable collector of reports.Response:Even if so, three other biographers wrote about the event, two before Tabari. Dismissing all as unreliable is not tenable. Tabari was not uncritical; for example, he expressed doubts about some reports from people of the Torah (Woman in the Qur’an, Tradition, and Their Interpretation, Barbara Freye Stowasser, p. 28).Objection 7:The strongest hadiths do not mention this story explicitly.Response:Bukhari (vol. 3, book 19, nos. 173, 176; vol. 6, book 60, nos. 385–386) and Abu Dawud (vol. 1, book 2, no. 1401) document the unusual prostration at the recitation of Surah 53. This strongly suggests something unique occurred.Objection 8:Shaykh al-Albani criticized the isnad (chain of transmission) for these reports.Response:According toAnswering Islam, al-Albani has been shown to contradict himself on isnad criticism. SeeAl-Albani Unveiledby Sayf ad-Din Ahmed Ibn Muhammad Amirul Islam for many examples.Objection 9:Non-Muslims bring up this story to attack Muhammad and Islam.Response:The event was not invented by non-Muslims but recorded by early Muslims. Ignoring criticism merely because it opposes one’s views is not the path of truth. Christians are called to expose false prophets out of love, desiring Muslims to turn from error and find salvation in the true Jesus Christ.Where Do We Go from Here?Muslims themselves are not unanimous on whether Satan’s words entered the Qur’an.Option 1:If Muhammad did speak as a prophet concerning the intercession of Allah’s daughters, he was a false prophet for that time.Option 2:If Muhammad never uttered the Satanic Verses, all four early biographers must have conspired in error. Some people may choose to follow something even if they believe their leader spoke Satan’s words.Either way, Islam teaches that Allah allowed his word to be substantially altered and allowed even sincere followers to be led astray. The Qur’an (Surah 43:44–45) claims all previous prophets shared the same message, and Surah 41:43 claims nothing was sent to Muhammad that was not previously sent to other prophets. Thus, either:a) Allah allowed his prior revelations to be corrupted, orb) The Qur’an is itself a corrupted message.In both cases, Islam concedes that Allah cannot be trusted to preserve his word against substantial doctrinal change.Trust in GodThe Almighty God is able to preserve His message. People should trust in God more.Trust that God has preserved His word.Surah 5:46–48 states that Jesus confirmed the Torah in his time, and that God gave the Scriptures to Jews and Christians, which could be used to discern truth even during Muhammad’s life. Surah 3:48 and 5:110–111 show Jesus had both the Torah and the Gospel. Jesus’ disciples were inspired. The Bible says, “The word of God endures forever” (Isaiah 59:21; 40:8; Psalm 119:89). God’s word was never corrupted in the past and has been preserved without major error to this day (Isaiah 55:11; 1 Peter 1:23–25; Psalm 119:89, 91, 144, 160).Trust that God desires you to know the truth and come to Him.God does not wish for anyone to perish (Ezekiel 18:23, 32; 2 Peter 3:9). All are called to believe the Gospel of Jesus Christ (2 Thessalonians 1:8).Do not put your trust in mortal men. “Do not be wise in your own eyes” (Proverbs 3:7). Instead, “Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make your paths straight” (Proverbs 3:5–6). Do you believe God can direct your ways if you acknowledge Him?Trust in Jesus: He came from God, and God’s message is preserved. Jesus is not a thief or a robber (John 10:8–10). Believe that Jesus gave His life as a ransom (Matthew 20:28), as a sin offering (Romans 8:3), by the blood He shed on the cross (Hebrews 10:19).Believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved(Acts 16:31). “…‘Whoever believes in him will not be put to shame’” (Romans 10:11). So trust God and believe He leads faithfully. He did not allow His word to be corrupted, so the Bible can be trusted. Give your life to Jesus, and He will give you peace and joy.www.MuslimHope.comwww.maxshimbaministries.orgAugust 26, 2016",

A companion of Muhammad, Amr bin Al-Aas, once asked the Prophet of Allah (peace be upon him):“O Prophet of Allah, which of your wives do you love the most?”The Prophet Muhammad replied, “Aisha.”As we read above, Muhammad loved Aisha more than all his other wives.However:Aisha, the daughter of Abu Bakr, was discovered engaging in sexual relations with Safwan bin al-Muattal.It is narrated by Ibn Hisham and by Ibn Ishaq that Aisha was caught in adultery (“zina”) with Safwan ibn al-Muattal, one of the companions of Muhammad. This event, commonly referred to as the “Safwan Incident,” took place in Medina. News of the incident spread throughout the city, prompting the Prophet of Allah to send Aisha back to her parents’ home.Ali, who was Muhammad’s cousin and the husband of his daughter Fatimah, reportedly advised Muhammad to divorce Aisha to conceal the great shame caused by the accusation of adultery.This is a highly sensitive secret among Muslims, and there is a reluctance to acknowledge that Aisha committed adultery with Safwan ibn al-Muattal, leading Muhammad to return her to her parents.If Aisha was so dearly loved by Muhammad above all his other wives, why did she decide to commit adultery with Safwan ibn al-Muattal?This was a great calamity for Muhammad and the Muslim community.Perhaps this explains why Aisha refused to bear children with Muhammad—or perhaps it was due to Muhammad’s own misconduct, including his alleged sexual relations with his female slaves (see:Islam Watch article).The Muslims of Medina, led by Abdullah bin Ubai, publicly declared that Lady Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her) had committed adultery with Safwan. When the Prophet (peace be upon him) heard these accusations, he summoned his companions to consult with them on what action to take, and some advised him to divorce her. The Prophet visited Aisha and told her:“If you are not guilty, then surely Allah will acquit you; but if you are, then seek forgiveness from your Lord.”Aisha wept and asked her parents for forgiveness for the adultery she allegedly committed with Safwan, but her parents had nothing to say in her defense.References:Ibn Sa’d,Al-Tabaqat al-Kubra, Vol. 8 (Arabic)Ibn Hisham,Sira al-Nabawiyya(Arabic)Dr. Sami Alrabaa,Karen in Saudi ArabiaSahih al-Bukhari, Chapter of Washing, narrated by Anas (Arabic)Al-Lulu wa Al-Marjan fima ittafaqa alayhi al-shaykhan: Muslim and Bukhari, Hadith No. 168; 173 (Arabic)Questions for Reflection:Why did Aisha refuse to have children with Muhammad, the Prophet of Allah, especially knowing that Muhammad loved her so dearly?How do these incidents influence our understanding of Islamic history and the character of its central figures?With all due respect to all Muslims, it is evident that this religion is filled with many oddities and contradictions.Source:www.maxshimbaministries.orgPosted on August 26, 2016For further academic discussion, these accounts should be critically examined in light of classical Islamic sources, modern scholarship, and the historical context in which they were written.",

Therefore, Jesus was not a Muslim.JESUS DID NOT WORSHIP ALLAHJesus never prayed to or worshipped \"Allah,\" but according to the Bible, Jesus prayed to His Father, John 17:1 These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee: The Quran and Islam acknowledge that Allah is not the Father, and there is not a single verse that calls Allah Father. Jesus was not a Muslim.JESUS DID NOT PRAY FACING MECCAJesus never prostrated himself facing Mecca, a requirement in praying to or worshipping \"ALLAH.\" Quran 2:149. Whencesoever thou comest forth turn thy face toward the Inviolable Place of Worship; and wheresoever ye may be (O Muslims) turn your faces toward it (when ye pray) so that men may have no argument against you save such of them as do injustice - Fear them not, but fear Me! - and so that I may complete My grace upon you, and that ye may be guided. 150. Whencesoever ye cometh forth turn your face toward the Inviolable Place of Worship. And wheresoever ye may be (O Muslims) turn your faces toward it so that people shall have no accusation against you, except such of them as do wrong; fear them not, but fear Me; and that I may complete My favor upon you, and that ye may be guided aright.Now let's read about how Jesus prayed in the Bible. Where did He look while praying?Jesus prayed looking up to Heaven. Read: Mark 6:41 And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all.In the above verse, we have evidence that Jesus looked up to Heaven where His Father is, and not towards Mecca.JESUS DID NOT TEACH ABOUT THE KAABAJesus never mentioned or taught His disciples about the \"KAABA,\" which is done by Muslims and was taught by Muhammad, the prophet of Allah.JESUS DID NOT FAST DURING RAMADANJesus did not fast during Ramadan, which is part of Islam to fast during Ramadan every year. Quran 2:183, O ye who believe! Fasting is prescribed to you, as it was prescribed to those before you, that ye may (learn) self-restraint.There is not a single part in the Bible where we read that Jesus commanded His followers to fast every year, but we read that in Matthew 6:16-18: Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. 17 But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face; 18 That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.JESUS DID NOT ENGAGE IN JIHADJesus did not engage in Jihad as every Muslim is commanded to engage in Jihad. Quran 2:216. Warfare is ordained for you, though it is hateful unto you; but it may happen that ye hate a thing which is good for you, and it may happen that ye love a thing which is bad for you. Allah knoweth, ye know not.But Jesus said the following about fighting: John 18:36 Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.In the above verse, Jesus teaches us that His Kingdom is not of this world but Heaven, so He cannot engage in Jihad as Allah commands Muslims. Jesus was not a Muslim, and He did not engage in Jihad.JESUS SAID TO LOVE YOUR ENEMIES, WHILE ALLAH SAYS HATE CHRISTIANS AND JEWSJesus did not hate those who opposed Him, but He loved them and prayed for them, contrary to Allah's commands to Muslims. Read Matthew 5:44 But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you.Now let's see how Allah shows hatred towards His followers. Quran 5:51. O ye who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians for friends. They are friends one to another. He among you who taketh them for friends is (one) of them. Lo! Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk.JESUS DID NOT TEACH TO STONE ADULTERERSJesus did not stone people to death, nor did He teach that adulterers should be stoned, as is taught in the Islamic religion. Read John 8:6 This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not. 7 So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.But in Islam, we read about Muhammad ordering the stoning of an adulterer: Volume 2, Book 23, Number 413: Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar:A Jew brought to the Prophet two men who had committed sodomy with each other. The Prophet ordered both of them to be killed near the place of offering the funeral prayers beside the mosque.Therefore, Jesus was not a Muslim, and He did not stone adulterers, but we read about Muhammad stoning people and teaching the stoning of adulterers in Islam.JESUS DID NOT TEACH PEOPLE TO PERFORM ABLUTION BEFORE PRAYINGJesus did not follow the ritual of washing or performing ablution before praying, as Muslims do every day. Read about Jesus in Matthew 15:2-11. But Allah practices the rituals of washing and ablution before worshipping Him. Quran 5:6. O ye who believe! When ye prepare for prayer, wash your faces, and your hands (and arms) to the elbows; Rub your heads (with water); and (wash) your feet to the ankles. If ye are in a state of ceremonial impurity, bathe your whole body. But if ye are ill, or on a journey, or one of you cometh from offices of nature, or ye have been in contact with women, and ye find no water, then take for yourselves clean sand or earth, and rub therewith your faces and hands, Allah doth not wish to place you in a difficulty, but to make you clean, and to complete His favor to you, that ye may be grateful.Jesus did not perform ablution before praying to His Father as in Islam. Jesus was not a Muslim.JESUS NEVER USED THE TERMS \"SAW\" OR \"PBUH\"Jesus never told people to write abbreviations like \"SAW\" and \"PBUH\" after mentioning their names, unlike Allah and His Prophet, who teach to say so in Islam after mentioning the names of Prophets and Messengers.Dear readers, today we have read about Jesus and His character and teachings, all of which contradict the laws and customs of Islam.It is my hope that this publication will help you understand that Jesus did not follow Islamic customs and did not worship Allah.God bless you allIn His ServiceI am Max Shimba, a servant of Jesus ChristCopyright © Max Shimba Ministries 2013www.maxshimbaministries.orgJuly 23, 2016",

    "full_content": "I REFUSE TO BE A MUSLIM BECAUSE ALLAH WILL ENTER HELL LIKE CREATURES OF SINBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaMax Shimba Ministries Org – Tuesday, May 24, 2016IntroductionIn today’s world, there are numerous paths of hope being preached. Eternal joy and Heaven are spoken of everywhere. Yet despite this universal yearning, religions, philosophies, and ideologies diverge greatly in their interpretations of eternal hope. Each tradition claims to hold the truth, believing itself to be the sure foundation of salvation.Among these divergent beliefs is the Islamic doctrine as articulated in the Quran. Specifically,Surat Maryam 19:71–72declares:“There is not one of you but will pass over it [Hell]; this is with your Lord a decree which must be accomplished. Then We shall save those who used to fear Allah and were dutiful to Him, and We shall leave the wrongdoers therein, humbled to their knees.”This Quranic passage implies thatevery person, including Muslims, is alreadypredestinedto enter Hell. This is claimed to be Allah’s irrevocable judgment, although a promise of eventual salvation is offered to the God-fearing. But this raises a critical theological and moral question:Is this doctrine truly credible or divinely just?The Quran’s Position on Hell and Divine JudgmentThe Quran further supports this idea inSurah Ghafir (40:60):“And your Lord said: Call upon Me, I will respond to you. Verily! Those who scorn My worship, they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!”It is alarming that Allah, the supreme being in Islam, states not only that people will be condemned to Hell but that even those who call upon Him can fall into Hell’s torment due to arrogance or misdeeds. If this decree is universal and binding, then all Muslims are effectively doomed from the outset—even while professing to follow Allah.This forms one of the theological inconsistencies that makes it difficult for me, as a Christian, to embrace a religion whose god has alreadydecreed Hellas the default destiny for all his followers, only to later \"rescue\" some from within the fire.Does Allah Literally Enter Hell?Beyond predestining Muslims for Hell, certain Islamic traditions contain even more startling assertions. InSahih al-Bukhari, Volume 6, Book 60, Hadith 371, it is reported:Narrated Anas: The Prophet (ﷺ) said, “People will be thrown into Hell (Jahannam), and it will keep asking, ‘Are there any more (to come)?’ until the Lord of the worlds places His Foot over it. Then it will say, ‘Enough! Enough!’”This hadith implies thatAllah Himself will physically place His Foot into Hellto stop it from demanding more souls. This anthropomorphic portrayal of God raises troubling questions. If Hell remains unfilled until Allah steps into it, where in the Quran or Hadith is it stated that Allah later removes His Foot or exits Hell? This further challenges Islamic notions of transcendence and divine separation from sin and punishment.The Biblical Contrast: No Entry to Heaven Through HellThe Christian Scriptures paint a wholly different picture of final judgment. InLuke 16:24, the parable of the rich man and Lazarus illustrates the finality of one’s eternal destination:“So he called to him, ‘Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire.’”This text emphasizes thatthere is a fixed chasmbetween Hell and Heaven. No one traverses from the torment of Hell into the joy of Heaven. Unlike the Quran, which implies a temporary punishment followed by salvation,the Bible teaches that judgment is final and irreversible.Furthermore,Proverbs 16:25warns:“There is a way that seems right to a man, but in the end it leads to death.”This confirms that not all spiritual paths lead to life. Some, even though seemingly moral or religious, end in destruction. In this light, the Islamic path, which begins with the assurance of Hell, contradicts the Christian doctrine of immediate redemption through faith in Christ.The Christian Way: Jesus Christ as the Only Path to Eternal LifeWhy, then, should I, as a Christian, adopt a religion whose divine system begins by condemning its followers to Hell? The Bible gives a better way—a Living Way—in the person of Jesus Christ. InJohn 14:5–6, Thomas said:“Lord, we don’t know where you are going, so how can we know the way?”Jesus answered, “I am the Way and the Truth and the Life. No one comes to the Father except through me.”In the Christian worldview,Jesus is not just a prophet, but the exclusive mediator of salvation.He is the Way—not through fire, but through grace.2 Corinthians 4:3–4further clarifies that many have been spiritually blinded by the \"god of this age\" (Satan), preventing them from seeing the light of the Gospel:“Even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing. The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers...”The second step, after recognizing that Jesus is the Way, the Truth, and the Life, is tobelieve in Him and confess Him:“If you declare with your mouth, ‘Jesus is Lord,’ and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.” – Romans 10:9–10It is through such faith and confession that one receiveslegal redemption—taking our share in Christ's atoning work on the Cross.Final Appeal: Choose Life Through ChristMany people know of Jesus, and may even speak His name, but have not surrendered their lives to Him. They remain in religious traditions that do not lead to salvation.Matthew 10:32–33reminds us:“Whoever acknowledges me before others, I will also acknowledge before my Father in heaven. But whoever disowns me before others, I will disown before my Father in heaven.”Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is indeed the onlyWay, Truth, and Life. There is no salvation outside of Him. When you believe in Jesus and obey His Word, you receive peace, eternal life, and joy—not only in this world, but also in the world to come.ConclusionThese are a few of the many reasons why Ireject Islam. It is a system that already condemns its followers to Hell by divine decree. On the other hand,Jesus Christ offers eternal life freely to all who believe in Him. I encourage you to come to Jesus Christ today.“Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts.” – Hebrews 3:15Dr. Maxwell ShimbaServant of Jesus ChristMax Shimba Ministries Org",

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba | Shimba Ministries InternationalOriginally Published: Sunday, May 22, 2016AbstractThis essay presents a theological critique of gender inequality in the Islamic vision of paradise as depicted in the Qur'an. The author contrasts the Christian vision of salvation through Jesus Christ—characterized by equality, dignity, and spiritual unity across genders—with the Qur'anic depiction of paradise, which appears to favor men and marginalize women, especially those of African descent. The central argument is posed in the form of three theological questions directed at African Muslim women, aiming to stimulate scripturally grounded dialogue and invite reconsideration of the claims made in Islamic eschatology regarding gender.Introduction: The Promise of Christ vs. the Rewards of IslamBefore presenting my theological inquiry, I wish to share the promises of Jesus Christ—who lived over 570 years before the Prophet Muhammad—as they relate to gender equality and the afterlife. Jesus Christ spoke of a kingdom not built upon earthly desires or human hierarchies, but one where men and women are equal inheritors of divine glory:Luke 20:34-36Jesus replied, “The people of this age marry and are given in marriage. But those who are considered worthy of taking part in the age to come and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage, and they can no longer die; for they are like the angels. They are God’s children, since they are children of the resurrection.”The teaching of Jesus emphasizes agenderless equalityin the Kingdom of God, where marital status is irrelevant and all are like angels. Jesus offers a future where both men and women are considered co-heirs of the divine promise, regardless of race or status.Galatians 3:27-29For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.In this Kingdom—one of righteousness and justice—none are prioritized based on gender. Even the patriarchs of the faith, such as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, await the company of both men and women who have trusted in Christ:Matthew 8:11“I say to you that many will come from the east and the west, and will take their places at the feast with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.”Those who practiced unrighteousness, regardless of status or religious affiliation, will be cast out, for Christ demands holiness:Luke 13:27-29“I don’t know you or where you come from. Away from me, all you evildoers!” There will be weeping there, and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but you yourselves thrown out.People will come from east and west and north and south, and will take their places at the feast in the kingdom of God.The Qur’anic Description of Paradise: A Male-Centric VisionLet us now consider the Islamic depiction of paradise, as revealed by Muhammad in the Qur’an. Below are selected passages from the Qur’an that outline the rewards promised primarily tomalebelievers.Surah Ar-Rahman 55:56“In them (Gardens) will be maidens with restrained glances, whom no man or jinn has ever touched.”Here, paradise offers virginal women—never touched by man or jinn—as companions to male believers. These women are not earthly women, not those who have lived, suffered, or borne children. This implicitly excludes the average African Muslim woman who may have been married, widowed, or abused.Surah At-Tur 52:20“Reclining on thrones lined up, We will marry them to fair women with wide, lovely eyes.”Surah As-Saffat 37:48–49“And with them will be companions with beautiful, big, and lustrous eyes, like preserved pearls.”These descriptions suggest that:Only specific types of women—fair-skinned and with large eyes—will populate paradise.These women have not been touched by men or jinn.These women are createdfor men; there is no reciprocal promise to believing women.In these verses, there is no mention of African women—especially not women with African features—or any promise that women themselves will receive partners created for their pleasure.Three Theological Questions for African Muslim WomenBased on these Qur’anic promises, I pose three scripturally focused questions to my Muslim sisters, especially those of African heritage:Is there any verse in the Qur’an that specifically promises thatyou—as African Muslim women—will be married in paradise?Is there any verse that promises thatyouwill receive male partners who have never touched women or jinn?Is there any verse that promises thatyouwill be transformed to have large eyes like goblets or resemble preserved eggs, so that you may be equally glorified like the fair maidens promised to men?If the answer to all these questions is “No,” then I humbly and without hostility invite you to examine the teachings of Jesus Christ, who offers an eternal kingdom without gender bias, without racial discrimination, and without favoritism. In His kingdom,men and women are co-heirs, andall who believe in Him—regardless of background—shall be saved.Conclusion: The Invitation to Christ's Egalitarian KingdomThe vision of paradise in the Christian gospel is not rooted in carnal desire, nor does it elevate one gender over another. It is a Kingdom based on faith, love, and holiness—a Kingdom where neither African women nor any other people group is forgotten or marginalized.“Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.”—Matthew 5:8This message is not shared out of antagonism, but out of sincere love for truth and justice. Therefore, I kindly ask Muslim scholars and believers alike: please respond not with emotion, but withevidencefrom the Qur’an—if it exists.Until then, I affirm with peace:Come to Jesus, who welcomes all.Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Ministries InternationalMay 22, 2016Watakabahu.",

    "full_content": "Muhammad’s “Satanic Portion” and the Four Surgeries: A Critical AnalysisIntroductionThe biography (Sīra) and hadith literature regarding the life of Muhammad, the founder of Islam, contain a remarkable narrative that is rarely discussed in mainstream Islamic apologetics. The narrative asserts that Muhammad underwent multiple “surgeries” by the angel Jibril (Gabriel), during which a portion described as the “share of Satan” was removed from his heart. This account, referenced in authoritative Islamic sources, raises significant theological and philosophical questions about the nature of prophethood and the concept of sinlessness (ismah) in Islam.The Four Surgeries in the Life of MuhammadAccording to the traditional sources, the Prophet Muhammad was subjected to the removal of the “share of Satan” onfour separate occasions:At the age of threeAt the age of tenAt the age of fortyAt the age of forty-three, prior to the event of Isra’ and Mi’raj (the Night Journey and Ascension)Primary Source: The Hadith of Anas bin MalikA narration from Anas bin Malik reports:“The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) was playing with other boys when the Angel Jibril (Gabriel) came to him, took him, laid him down, split open his chest, and removed his heart. He then extracted a portion of clotted blood and said, ‘This is the share of Satan in you.’ He washed (the heart) in a golden vessel filled with Zamzam water, then returned it to its place and sealed it up.”(Reference: Sahih Muslim, Vol. 1, p. 147, Hadith No. 713)Theological Questions Arising from the NarrativeThis account raises severalcritical questions:1.How did Satan’s portion enter Muhammad’s heart?The narrative presupposes that a portion belonging to Satan resided in Muhammad’s heart, thus necessitating a surgical intervention by Gabriel. This contradicts the Islamic doctrine of the innate purity (fitrah) of prophets.2.Since when can Satan be expelled or cleansed by washing with water?The notion that the influence of Satan can be physically removed by washing with Zamzam water anthropomorphizes Satan and suggests a material impurity, which is inconsistent with both Islamic and Christian demonology.Comparative Analysis: Jesus and MuhammadIn a hadith reported by Abu Huraira, Muhammad said:“Every human being is touched by Satan at birth. Satan touches the side of every child of Adam as he is born, except for Mary and her son (Jesus). Satan attempted to touch them but found a veil [preventing him].”(Referenced in Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim)This contrast is significant. According to the hadith,Jesus (Isa ibn Maryam)is uniquely exempt from Satan’s touch, while even Muhammad himself was not spared. This raises a fundamental question for Muslim readers:If Jesus was never touched by Satan, and Muhammad needed four supernatural surgeries to remove Satan’s share, should not Jesus be recognized as superior in purity and spiritual status?ConclusionThe hadith regarding Muhammad’s “satanic portion” and its removal by Gabriel introduces serious theological difficulties regarding the Islamic view of prophetic purity and the nature of evil. The peculiar idea of “washing” Satan with Zamzam water diminishes the spiritual gravity of the struggle against evil, reducing it to a physical or ritual act.For those seeking a prophet untouched by Satan, as even the Islamic tradition concedes, it is Jesus Christ alone who fits that description.With respect,Max Shimba, servant of Jesus ChristFor Dr. Maxwell Shimba Ministries OrgMAX SHIMBA MINISTRIES ORG ©2016.

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell Shimba, Servant of Jesus ChristMax Shimba Ministries Org ©2016. All Rights ReservedPublished: Sunday, May 1, 2016IntroductionThis article seeks to explore a theological dilemma rooted in Islamic scripture, namely, the Quranic assertion that Allah cannot have a son without engaging in a marital relationship. We will investigate this claim using direct references from the Quran and analyze the internal inconsistencies it presents when compared to natural processes and Biblical narratives. The theological critique offered herein aims to provoke deep reflection on the Islamic understanding of divine capacity and limitation.Quranic Assertion: A Limitation on Divine Power?We begin with a verse from the Quran,Surat Al-Anʿām (6:101), which was revealed in Mecca. It reads:“He is the Originator of the heavens and the earth. How can He have a son when He does not have a consort (wife)? He created all things and He is, of all things, Knowing.”— (Qur'an 6:101)This verse explicitly questions the possibility of Allah having a son in the absence of a wife, implying a biological limitation that applies to him as a deity. Herein lies the theological dilemma: how can a being who claims to be theCreator of all thingsbe limited by the need for a spouse to produce offspring?If Allah is indeed omnipotent and the creator of all natural processes, including reproduction, then logically he should transcend such biological limitations. By asserting that he cannot have a son without a wife, the verse indirectly attributes to Allah the limitations of created beings—an argument that undermines the concept of divine omnipotence.Natural Phenomena That Contradict the ClaimLet us examine nature, which Allah claims to have created, and assess whether reproduction necessarily requires two counterparts. We find thatcertain trees can reproduce without mating, and in human biology,cells divide through a process called mitosis, which does not require a male or female counterpart.Mitosis is asexual reproduction occurring in four stages:Prophase, Metaphase, Anaphase, and Telophase.This process leads to the creation of new cells without the union of two distinct entities. (See:NCBI - Mitosis and Cell Cycle;Genetics Home Reference - Cell Division)If Allah claims to have created these systems that function without the need for sexual union, it is theologically inconsistent for him to require a wife to have a son. This contradiction challenges the core claim of Allah’s omnipotence.The Virgin Birth of Mary as a Case StudyThe story of Mary (Maryam) and the virgin birth of Jesus (Isa) in the Quran further complicates the issue. According toSurat Aal Imran (3:45, 47):“When the angels said: O Mary, indeed Allah gives you good tidings of a Word from Him, whose name will be the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary — distinguished in this world and the Hereafter and among those brought near to Allah.”(3:45)“She said: My Lord, how will I have a child when no man has touched me? He said: Thus it is — Allah creates what He wills. When He decrees a matter, He only says to it, ‘Be,’ and it is.”(3:47)In this passage, Allah claims that He can create without the need for human agency, simply by commanding,“Be!”(Kun fa-yakūn). If this is truly the case, thenwhy does Allah in Surat Al-Anʿām 6:101 deny the possibility of having a son unless He has a consort?This internal contradiction in the Quranic narrative is both theological and logical. Mary is granted the divine power to conceive without intercourse, yet Allah cannot have a son unless he has a wife. If Allah gave Mary the ability, why could He not apply that same creative power to Himself?The Quran’s Own Confession of InferiorityFurthermore,Surat Al-Lail (92:1–3)presents an even more concerning theological implication:“By the night when it covers, by the day when it appears, and by He who created the male and the female…”— (Qur'an 92:1–3)This verse raises a significant question: Who is being referenced as the one who created male and female? If Allah is swearing by the one who created male and female, is he referring to himself or another being?Swearing by a higher authority or creator would implysubordination, which is incompatible with divinity. A true God does not swear by another creator, for He is the Creator. Therefore, this passage may inadvertently indicate that Allah is not the true originator of life — a severe theological error in Islamic doctrine.Theological Questions That EmergeThe above analysis invites several crucial theological inquiries:If Allah is the Creator of all things, why does he claim incapacity to have a son without a wife?How is it that Mary can have a son without a man, but Allah cannot have a son without a woman?If Allah gave Mary that divine ability, why could He not grant it to Himself?Why does Allah swear by someone else who created male and female if He is supposedly the sole Creator?These inconsistencies reveal a profound theological weakness in the Quranic representation of Allah’s nature and power.ConclusionIn conclusion, the Quran portrays Allah as a deity bound by human-like biological constraints, which is incompatible with the notion of absolute divine omnipotence. If Allah cannot have a son without a consort, and yet enables Mary to conceive without a husband, this not only exposes an inconsistency but also undermines his claimed sovereignty.True divinity, as revealed in the person of Jesus Christ, transcends all natural and biological limits. Jesus was born of a virgin, not through sexual union, but by the power of the Holy Spirit — the true manifestation of divine omnipotence.May God bless you as you seek the truth.— Dr. Maxwell Shimba,Servant of Jesus ChristMax Shimba Ministries Org",

THEREFORE, ALLAH, MUHAMMAD, AND HIS RELIGION REPRESENT 666Dear Reader,In this tract, we will learn about theBeastmentioned in the Book of Revelation in the Holy Bible.InRevelation 13:18, a prophecy is made about a beast whose name will number 666. Bible scholars (theologians) have differed in the interpretation of this verse.The primary passage in the Bible that mentions the “mark of the beast” isRevelation 13:15–18. Other references can be found inRevelation 14:9, 11; 15:2; 16:2; 19:20; and 20:4.This mark is used as a seal for the followers of the Antichrist and the false prophet (the spokesperson of the Antichrist). The false prophet (the second beast) is the one who causes people to receive this mark. The mark is specifically placed on the hand or forehead—not a card that someone will carry.Before openly declaring who this “beast” with the number “666” is, let me first clarify two key points: First, know that the book of Revelation is a prophetic book.The Beast – Revelation 13:1–18Everything is identified by its characteristics and actions. A name alone cannot verify a person or thing, as names are often shared or changed. Therefore, in this article, I will not waste time researching names as those theologically bankrupt scholars do. Instead, I will interpret the characteristics mentioned in Revelation so that every reader with a calm mind can discern for themselves who this beast is.Let us first understand where this beast gets such great power. As is known, the world is currently under the dominion of Satan (see John 12:31, 16:11; 1 John 5:19, etc.). Therefore, the beast has been given authority by Satan, the “Dragon” (see Revelation 13:1–10, 12:7–9). Thus, this \"Beast\" is Satan's agent on earth. He will use all means—force, persuasion, etc.—to cause humanity to rebel against Almighty God and obey his master (Satan).Characteristics of the BeastHe will be praised, obeyed, and feared by all the people of the earth.“…The whole world was astonished and followed the beast. People worshiped the dragon because he had given authority to the beast, and they also worshiped the beast and asked, ‘Who is like the beast? Who can wage war against it?’” (Revelation 13:3–4)Leaders of nations (presidents, kings, sultans, etc.) will rely on him and give him their power and authority.They will govern according to the will of the “beast.” Therefore, they will be agents of the beast in their own countries—and thus, also agents of the “Dragon” (Satan).“…The ten horns you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but who for one hour will receive authority as kings along with the beast. They have one purpose and will give their power and authority to the beast.” (Revelation 17:12–13)ALLAH APPOINTS A PROPHET “BEAST”Surat An-Naml 27:82–“And when the Word is fulfilled against them, We shall bring out from the earth a beast to them, which will speak to them because mankind did not believe with assurance in Our signs.”Allah says He will send a Beast who will speak to the people.The Quran is the number 666. Let me show you how 666 is embedded within the Quran.First, understand that the number SIX is a fixed number in mathematics. It is the only number that when you add or multiply the first three numbers, you still get 6.1 + 2 + 3 = 61 × 2 × 3 = 6Surah 111contains100 letters, and theGematrical Valueof the Arabic letterQafis100.Surah 111has6 verses. 111 × 6 =666→ The Quran.Surah 6:111→ when multiplied gives you a total of666in the Qaf code table.Muslims say “Allahu Akbar”111 timesin their daily contact prayers.If you add the digits of 666 (6+6+6), you get18, and the number111is composed of 100 + 10 + 1.Now consider this:Surah18has111 verses, and 18 × 111 =1998→ 666 × 3.(Reference:http://freerepublic.com/focus/f-chat/1971221/posts)THE SECRET HAS BEEN REVEALED! WE NOW KNOW THAT ALLAH IS THE ONE WHO WILL BRING THE ANTICHRIST (666), AND ALLAH CONFIRMS IN SURAT AN-NAML THAT HE HAS ALREADY APPOINTED A PROPHET WHO IS A BEAST, AND THAT THIS PROPHET RECITES MUHAMMAD’S QURAN.If indeed the Quran is the word of Allah and He sent it down, then today we know that Allah is not only the one who will bring the Antichrist, but thatAllah and Muhammad themselves are the Antichrist.Why do Muslims say:\"Islam will dominate the world\"?Why did Allah create a Beast and appoint it as a Prophet?Surely, there is a great mystery in Islam, which stands against Christ.Come to Jesus, who is theOnly Way to Heaven.God bless you all.—I am Max Shimba, servant of Jesus ChristFor Max Shimba Ministries Org©2016 MAX SHIMBA MINISTRIES ORG.

However, that claim is contradicted by several verses in the Quran.“When we heard the guidance, we believed in it; and whoever believes in his Lord will not fear any loss or being burdened with the sins (of another).” (Quran 72:13)The Quran says that one who believes in the Almighty God should not fear being burdened with the sins of another.But, are there people who can bear the sins of others?Read Quran Surah An-Nahl (16), verse 25:“There are those who mislead others so that they will bear the burdens of those they misled on the Day of Judgment, and also carry their own burdens. Surely, evil is the load they carry!”Allah, through the Quran, tells all Muslims that this burden of sin they carry is extremely evil and they have been misled to bear it until the Day of Judgment.NOW, if carrying sin on the Day of Judgment is extremely evil, where can we offload that burden?READ Psalm 55:22“Cast your burden on the LORD, and He shall sustain you; He shall never permit the righteous to be moved.”THE BIBLE RESPONDS TO MUSLIMS, telling them to cast their burden on the LORD. That’s why all Christians have realized this truth.CONTINUE READING John 13:13“You call Me Teacher and Lord, and you say well, for so I am.”Jesus says,\"You call me Teacher and Lord, and you say well.\"Now continue reading:Jeremiah 10:10“But the LORD is the true God; He is the living God and the everlasting King. At His wrath the earth will tremble, and the nations shall not be able to endure His indignation.”Jeremiah 10:10 responds to Muslims thatthis LORD is the true God.Now Muslims wonder how Jesus can be God and still die on the cross. Let us continue:Quran 55:29“All that are in the heavens and the earth ask of Him. Every day He is (engaged) in some affair.”The Quran itself responds clearly thateverything in heaven and on earth asks from Him.Dear Muslim, are you still wondering?Now look at what happened and what was fulfilled on the cross:READ 1 Peter 3:18–19“For Christ also suffered once for sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive by the Spirit, by whom also He went and preached to the spirits in prison.”The Word of God saysHis body was put to death but His spirit was made alive.Now there is no longer room for confusion because what was killed was onlyHis body, butHis spirit was not killed.Scripture saysGod is Spirit, so what was put to death was just His body—His Spirit was made alive.1 Timothy 6:15–16“...He who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings and Lord of lords, who alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen or can see, to whom be honor and everlasting power. Amen.”Now we see that Jesus made a good confession.READ verse 13 of 1 Timothy 6:“I urge you in the sight of God who gives life to all things, and before Christ Jesus who witnessed the good confession before Pontius Pilate...”For further evidence, read:Luke 18:31Then He took the twelve aside and said to them, “Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of Man will be accomplished.”BUT, our Muslim brothers saythe cross is the symbol of Satan. Let's begin with:Quran 7:16“Satan said: Because You have put me in error, I will sit in wait for them on Your Straight Path.”SATAN TELLS ALLAH: “Because You led me astray, I will surely lie in wait for them onYour Straight Path.”SATAN SWEARS TO STAND ON THE STRAIGHT PATH OF ALLAH.Now what is thisStraight Path of Allahwhere Satan swore to sit?Quran 6:126“And this (Quran) is the Straight Path of your Lord. We have detailed the verses for people who take heed.”So,SATAN IS SITTING ON THE STRAIGHT PATH, which isISLAM, as shown inQuran 7:16.Because Satan has taken his seat on the Straight Path, it meansSatan has a religion, or do you disagree?MUHAMMAD CONVERTS SATAN TO ISLAMAccording to the book“The Origin of the Jinn”, page 20, it says:“It is unfortunate that Adam and Eve did not make efforts to enable Satan and his offspring to ask forgiveness from Allah. It was only the Prophet Muhammad who converted Satan to Islam.”This is not surprising, because we already read in Surah Al-An'am thatSatan resides on the Straight Path of Allah. And that Straight Path isIslam, Quran 6:126:“And this religion of Islam is the Straight Path of your Lord.”Dear brethren, once again we’ve learned thatSatan is the leader of the religion of Islam.Satan is the one who sits on the Straight Path and has become a Muslim, as we read inThe Origin of the Jinn, page 20.This is yet another disaster in the religion of Allah, where we now understand thatSatan sits on the Straight Path and was converted to Islam by Muhammad.God bless you abundantly.I am Max Shimba, a servant of Jesus Christ,For Max Shimba Ministries OrgMAX SHIMBA MINISTRIES ORG ©2016.

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute / Max Shimba MinistriesDate of Original Publication:Monday, April 11, 2016Revised Translation and Theological Analysis (2025 Edition)AbstractThis article offers a theological and legal critique of the demand for Kadhi Courts by some Muslims in Tanzania. It argues, based on Qur’anic exegesis and Islamic jurisprudence, that the institution of the Kadhi Court lacks explicit Qur’anic authorization. Furthermore, it raises constitutional, legal, and human rights concerns about its implementation in a secular state like Tanzania, especially concerning the treatment of women, inter-sectarian disagreements, and judicial standards.IntroductionThe call for Kadhi Courts by some Tanzanian Muslims has sparked considerable debate concerning the legitimacy and compatibility of such courts within the nation's legal and constitutional framework. This paper critically examines the doctrinal basis for Kadhi Courts in Islam, specifically within the Qur'an, and explores the broader socio-political and ethical implications of introducing such institutions.1. Qur’anic Silence on the Kadhi CourtContrary to popular belief among many Muslims advocating for Kadhi Courts, the Qur’andoes not contain a single versethat mandates or even suggests the establishment of such courts. Nowhere in the Qur’an does Allah command Muslims to seek justice specifically through aKadhior a religious judicial system resembling a Kadhi Court.This absence invites important theological reflection:If Allah did not prescribe such courts, why do some Muslims insist on their institutionalization?Is it justifiable to construct a religious judiciary in Allah’s name where the Qur’an remains silent?2. Critical Questions on the Legitimacy and Function of the Kadhi CourtA. Who Appoints the Chief Kadhi and Kadhis?Where in the Qur’an is the appointment of a Chief Kadhi or subordinate Kadhis outlined? Who possesses the divine authority to make such appointments?No verse exists which grants any person or institution the power to appoint a Chief Kadhi.B. What Are the Qualifications for a Kadhi?The Qur’an does not define any qualifications—educational, moral, legal, or religious—for someone to serve as a Kadhi.Where are the verses outlining the academic or spiritual requirements for such an office?C. Legal Training and Secular Law ConflictsMost individuals appointed to Kadhi positions lack training in secular legal principles, including the Evidence Act and the Civil Procedure Act. What legal framework will these untrained officers use to ensure justice? And more importantly, how will their decisions align with the Tanzanian Constitution?D. Sunni and Shia DivisionsTanzania is home to both Sunni and Shia Muslims. Since these sects differ significantly in theology and jurisprudence, how will the system address the following:Will Kadhis be appointed from both sects?Will there be two different Kadhi Courts?How will inter-sectarian disputes be resolved?E. Gender Discrimination and Legal InjusticeThe application of Islamic family law, which heavily influences Kadhi Court decisions, raises grave concerns about gender equity. For instance:Marriage and Divorce:Only men are granted the unilateral right to initiate divorce (ṭalāq), per Surah 2:228–232 and Surah 65:1–7.Inheritance and Testimony:Women receive half the inheritance of men (Surah 4:11), and the testimony of two women is equal to one man’s (Surah 2:282).Domestic Discipline:Men are permitted to “strike” their wives lightly (Surah 4:34).Such injunctions are not only incompatible with modern constitutional law but also violate international standards on gender equality.3. Constitutional and Ethical IncompatibilityThe proposed Kadhi Courts pose a serious threat to the secular and democratic values enshrined in the Tanzanian Constitution. These courts:Violate the principle ofequal protection under the law.Institutionalizereligious discrimination, as they cater only to Muslims.Underminejudicial impartiality, replacing legal expertise with religious interpretation.Open the door toparallel legal systems, risking legal fragmentation and community division.How then will Muslims balance allegiance to national law with adherence to a religious court that contradicts both the Constitution and the fundamental rights it protects?4. Theological Warning: Inventing for Allah What He Did Not CommandEstablishing the Kadhi Court in Allah’s name, without His explicit command, is theologically dangerous. The Qur’an itself warns against attributing to Allah what He did not say:“Do not say about what your tongues describe falsely: ‘This is lawful, and this is unlawful,’ so as to fabricate lies against Allah. Indeed, those who fabricate lies against Allah will never prosper.”—Surah An-Nahl (16:116)Why do Muslims feel the need to “assist” Allah by introducing structures He never prescribed? To invent a court system in His name, when He is self-sufficient and almighty, is not only baseless—it is a form of theological innovation (bid‘ah), a grave sin in Islamic doctrine.5. Christian Invitation: True Freedom through ChristIn contrast to the legalistic systems of Islamic jurisprudence, Christianity offersfreedom from the bondage of the law through the grace of Jesus Christ. The Bible teaches:“For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.”—2 Corinthians 5:21And again:“For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so also by one Man’s obedience many will be made righteous.”—Romans 5:19The Mosaic law, much like Shariah, couldreveal sin but could not redeem from it. It is only through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ that true righteousness and spiritual transformation are made possible.“For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and death.”—Romans 8:2ConclusionThe proposal to institutionalize Kadhi Courts in Tanzania lacksQur’anic mandate, posesconstitutional dangers, and is fraught withtheological and ethical inconsistencies. As such, it must be rejected not only on legal grounds but on spiritual grounds as well.Instead of returning to legalism and religious stratification, Muslims are invited to embrace the grace and freedom found in Jesus Christ, who alone offers the righteousness of God apart from the law.Endnote“And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whoever believes in Him may have eternal life.”—John 3:14-15Come to Christ and be set free—not only from sin but from legal systems that can never save.© Max Shimba Ministries 2013Translated and Expanded by Max Shimba Ministries Org, 2025All rights reserved.",

Al-Hasan saw no harm in an owner kissing or fondling his slave girl with desire.**Ibn ‘Umar said, ‘If a slave girl eligible for sexual relations is gifted to another man, or sold, or freed, her former master must not have intercourse with her until she has had one menstrual period, to ensure she is not pregnant. This is not necessary for virgins.’‘Ata said, ‘There is no harm in fondling a pregnant slave girl with desire without intercourse. Allah said: \"Except with their wives or those their right hands possess—for (then) they are not to be blamed.\"’\"Footnote: “Pregnant and by someone else, not the current owner.”–Bukhari, Volume 3, Book 34 (The Book of Sales), Chapter 113 after Hadith 436, p.239-240.\"Abu Sa’id Al-Khudri said that while he was with the Prophet of Allah, he asked him, ‘O Messenger of Allah! We acquire captive women as part of our war booty and we are interested in their price. What is your view on coitus interruptus?’The Prophet replied, ‘Do you really do that? It is better for you not to do it. No soul that Allah has decreed to exist will fail to exist.’\"–Bukhari, Volume 3, Book 34 (The Book of Sales), Chapter 111, Hadith 432, p.237.\"Ibn Muhairiz narrated: I entered the mosque and saw Abu Sa’id Al-Khudri and sat beside him. I asked him about Al-‘Azl (i.e., coitus interruptus). Abu Sa’id said, ‘We went with the Messenger of Allah on the campaign of Banu Al-Mustaliq, and we captured some Arab women and we desired them, and celibacy became hard on us. We wanted to engage in coitus interruptus. So we asked the Prophet, and he said, ‘It is better not to do that, because if a soul is destined to exist, it will exist until the Day of Resurrection.’\"–Bukhari, Volume 5, Book 59 (The Book of Military Expeditions), Chapter 31, Hadith 459, p.317. This is also stated in Volume 8, Book 77 (The Book of Qadr), Chapter 3, Hadith 600, p.391.In other words, whatever is destined to happen will happen, so do not interfere unnaturally.

    "full_content": "By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute | Max Shimba Ministries Org.April 10, 2016AbstractOne of the most common objections raised against the divinity of Jesus Christ—especially by Muslim apologists and groups such as Jehovah's Witnesses—is the question:\"If Jesus was truly God, then to whom was He praying?\"This inquiry, often posed during interfaith discussions, is grounded in a misunderstanding of the dual nature of Christ and the eternal relationship within the Trinity. This scholarly article aims to address this theological question by exploring the scriptural, historical, and doctrinal foundation of Christ’s divine and human nature and His relationship to the Father.IntroductionIn various religious debates, a recurrent question is raised:When Jesus prayed in the Garden of Gethsemane, who was He praying to?The underlying presumption is that if Jesus is God, then it seems paradoxical for Him to pray. More provocatively, critics ask,Since when does God pray or ask for help?These questions merit a robust, biblically grounded response. To understand why Jesus prayed and to whom, one must first comprehend the Christian doctrine of the Trinity and the dual nature of Jesus Christ.The Eternal Relationship Between the Father and the SonBefore the incarnation—before the Word became flesh—Jesus existed eternally as the Son of God in perfect communion with the Father and the Holy Spirit. The Gospel of John affirms this pre-existence and unity:\"The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do... For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.\"(John 5:19–21)\"...that all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father.\"(John 5:23)Moreover,Isaiah 9:6prophetically declares:“For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given... and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.”This passage affirms both the humanity (\"a child is born\") and the divinity (\"a son is given\") of the Messiah. From eternity past, Jesus existed as theSon in the Godhead—coequal and coeternal with the Father and the Holy Spirit.The Doctrine of the TrinityChristian orthodoxy holds that God isone in essenceandthree in person: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. These are not three gods (tritheism), but one God in three distinct persons. Jesus Himself declared,\"I and the Father are one.\"(John 10:30)This statement does not negate personal distinction within the Godhead but affirms ontological unity. Thus, the Son praying to the Father does not signify inferiority but reflects the eternal relationship of love and purpose within the Trinity.The Dual Nature of Jesus Christ (Hypostatic Union)At the incarnation, the eternal Son took upon Himself full humanity while retaining full divinity. This is known as theHypostatic Union—two natures, divine and human, in one person. AsPhilippians 2:5–11explains:\"Christ Jesus... being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: But made himself of no reputation... and was made in the likeness of men...\"Thus, while on earth, Jesus operated fully as man, experiencing human needs, suffering, and dependence, all while remaining truly God. His prayers were a demonstration of His genuine humanity and His relationship with the Father.Jesus' Prayers as a Human BeingIn His earthly life, Jesus prayed frequently—seeking strength, wisdom, and communion with the Father:Mark 1:35– He rose early to pray in solitude.John 11:41–42– He prayed before raising Lazarus, to glorify the Father.John 17– He interceded for His disciples and all future believers in what is often called theHigh Priestly Prayer.These were not the prayers of a lesser deity but the heartfelt cries of the perfect man, perfectly submitted to the will of the Father.As Hebrews 5:8 states:“Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered.”Gethsemane and the Cross: Obedience to the Father's WillThe Garden of Gethsemane (Matthew 26:36–46) vividly portrays Jesus’ agony before the crucifixion. He prayed:“My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.”(v. 39)This was not a denial of divinity but a deep expression of His human anguish. His obedience in prayer revealed His full submission to the Father’s redemptive plan. It wasGod the Son, in human form, fully obedient even unto death, carrying out the will ofGod the Father.Jesus Is Both the One Who Prays and the One to Whom We PrayJesus prayed to the Father while on earth. At the same time, He is worshiped and prayed to, as seen in:Acts 7:59–“Lord Jesus, receive my spirit,”prayed Stephen.John 20:28– Thomas called Jesus,“My Lord and my God!”These texts confirm the early church’s recognition of Jesus’ divinity. He is both the intercessor and the object of faith and worship.Conclusion: No Contradiction in Christ’s PrayersThere is no theological contradiction in Jesus praying to the Father. His prayers reveal:The eternal communion within the Trinity.His full assumption of human nature, including dependence and suffering.The exemplary model of submission and prayer for all believers.Jesus Christ—fully God and fully man—demonstrated in His life of prayer the essential posture of obedience to God. His prayers were not evidence against His divinity but rather proof of the incarnate Word living in total alignment with the divine plan.For Further StudyThe Two Natures of Christ:Max Shimba Article –“Asilia Mbili za Yesu Kristo”Philippians 2:5–11andHebrews 1:1–3for Christ's divine identityJohn 17for the High Priestly Prayer and divine mission of JesusContact for Questions or DialogueEmail:maxshimbaministries@gmail.comPresented by:Dr. Maxwell ShimbaFor:Max Shimba Ministries Org.© 2015–2016, All Rights Reserved",

This assertion, according to Islamic apologetics, implies that Muhammad was prophesied in the Christian Bible. However, a close and contextual reading of the relevant biblical texts, especially in the Gospel of John, clearly demonstrates that the Spirit of Truth refers not to Muhammad or any angelic being, but to the Holy Spirit—God Himself.Muslim Claim: Who is the Spirit of Truth?Many Muslims often ask:Who is the Spirit of Truth that Jesus promised in John 16:12–14?When questioned, they claim that the Spirit of Truth refers either to Muhammad or to the angel Jibril. However, such interpretations fall apart under scriptural scrutiny.John 16:13 (KJV)says:\"Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.\"In the context of John chapters 14–16, Jesus is clearly speaking to His disciples shortly before His crucifixion, referring to the Holy Spirit, whom He will sendafterHis ascension. The Spirit of Truth is identified as divine, active within the lives of the disciples, and present within them—not as a future prophet or angel who comes 600 years later.Scriptural Evidences from the Gospel of JohnBelow are15 scriptural evidencesfrom the Gospel of John proving thatMuhammad is not the Spirit of TruthandJibril is not the Holy Spirit.1.John 1:32\"And John bore record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him [Jesus].\"The Holy Spirit descended upon Jesus at His baptism in visible form. Muhammad neither descended from heaven like a dove nor was present at Jesus' baptism. Moreover, Muhammad came over six centuries later and was never seen by John the Baptist.2.John 1:33\"And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, 'Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.'\"John the Baptist testifies that Jesus is the one who baptizeswiththe Holy Spirit. Muhammad never baptized anyone, and certainly not with the Holy Spirit.3.John 3:5\"Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.\"No one can enter God's Kingdom unless they are born of the Spirit. Muhammad does not impart the Holy Spirit, nor does he bring spiritual rebirth.4.John 3:6\"That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.\"Muhammad was born of the flesh, and never claimed to be born of the Spirit. In contrast, the Holy Spirit is the one who begets spiritual life.5.John 3:8\"The wind bloweth where it listeth... so is every one that is born of the Spirit.\"The Spirit is likened to the wind—unpredictable and sovereign. Muhammad was a man confined to a specific time, place, and culture. He does not fit this spiritual description.6.John 3:34\"For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.\"Jesus received the fullness of the Spirit without measure. Muhammad, however, claimed revelations from Jibril (not the Spirit Himself) and did not claim to have divine omniscience or omnipotence.7.John 4:24\"God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.\"God is Spirit—not Muhammad, not Jibril. The Holy Spirit is a divine person, not a mortal prophet or a created angel.8.John 6:63\"It is the Spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.\"Only the Spirit gives life. Muhammad does not and cannot give eternal life. Jesus' words are Spirit and life, a divine quality absent in Muhammad’s teachings.9.John 7:39\"But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.\"This verse refers to the future indwelling of the Holy Spirit for all believers in Jesus. It does not refer to Muhammad, who was never promised to believers in Christ.10.John 14:16–18“And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you forever;Even the Spirit of truth... ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.”Jesus refers to a Person who will dwell within believers—not someone who would come 600 years later to deliver external messages. Muhammad never dwelled in the hearts of the disciples.11.John 14:26\"But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.\"Jesus identifies the Comforter as theHoly Spirit. Not a man. Not Muhammad. The Holy Spirit comes in Jesus’ name, not his own.12.John 15:26\"But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth... he shall testify of me.\"The Spirit testifies of Christ. Muhammad denied the divine sonship of Jesus and did not bear witness to Him. Therefore, he disqualifies himself as the Spirit of Truth.13.John 16:13\"Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth... and he will shew you things to come.\"The Spirit was to come shortly after Christ’s ascension, guiding the apostles directly—not centuries later to a different audience, in a different language, and denying Christ’s deity.14.John 16:15\"All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you.\"The Spirit reveals the things of Christ. Muhammad never claimed to be indwelt by Christ, nor did he teach from Christ’s authority or glorify Him.15.John 20:21–22\"Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you.And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost.\"Jesus gave the Holy Spirit to His disciples directly—not through Muhammad, who was not born until centuries later. This marks the clear fulfillment of Jesus' promise.Conclusion: The Spirit of Truth is Not Muhammad or JibrilThrough careful exegesis of the Gospel of John, we conclude decisively and biblically:Muhammad is notthe Spirit of Truth.Jibril is notthe Holy Spirit.TheHoly Spirit is God—the Third Person of the Trinity, promised by Jesus, given to His disciples at Pentecost, and continuing to dwell in believers today.Jesus did not leave His disciples to wait 600 years for a mortal man to deliver final truth. He gave them the Holy Spirit—immediately,eternally, andpersonally.In His Service,Dr. Maxwell ShimbaFounder, Max Shimba MinistriesShimba Theological Institute© Max Shimba Ministries 2016.

They then claim that Muhammad is the true messenger because he came for the whole world. The verse they use to reject Jesus’ universal mission is the one He spoke when conversing with the Canaanite woman (i.e., a non-Jew), who was pleading with Jesus to heal her daughter.It is written:He answered, “I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.” (Matthew 15:26).God is a God of order and perfect timing. That is why He did not create everyone at once. He started with one man, and from that man, we all came. Likewise, He began by revealing Himself to only one nation on earth. From there, salvation would spread to all nations. It is an evident truth that, apart from Israel, all other societies in the world were originally idol worshippers (i.e., worshippers of demons). Only Israel began with the true God.That is why the Lord Jesus, when speaking with the Samaritan woman at the well, told her:“You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews.” (John 4:22).Salvation is from the Jews because no other nation on earth knew the true God—all had pagan religions—whether Europeans, Africans, Indians, Arabs, etc. That is the truth.To say that Jesus did not come for all nations is no different than saying, “Since God only created Adam and Eve, He is not the God of my family because He did not create me the same way He created Adam.”Jesus once spoke to His disciples and said:“This is what is written: The Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day, and repentance for the forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.” (Luke 24:46-47).Do you see that the Gospel was to begin in Jerusalem? And do you also see that He says all nations will be preached to in His name? Are all nations limited to Israel only?The Canaanite woman came at the wrong time. That was the time for preaching the Gospel to Israel first before it could go to the rest of the world.Below is further evidence from the words of the Lord Jesus Himself confirming that He was sent to all nations of the world and that He is the Messiah of God—meaning, the one anointed with the Holy Spirit to redeem the whole world:“But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.” (Acts 1:8).“Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.” (Matthew 28:19).“For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.” (John 3:17).“If anyone hears my words and does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world, but to save the world.” (John 12:47).“I lay down my life for the sheep. I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen. I must bring them also. They too will listen to my voice, and there shall be one flock and one shepherd.” (John 10:15-16).“And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.” (Matthew 24:14).Let me conclude by revisiting some points I have mentioned. God has always had a pattern of beginning with one person.He created one human being, and we all came from him.He revealed Himself to one nation, and we all came to know Him through that.He started with one Son (Jesus), and we are all born again through faith in Him.In the same way, He brought salvation first to one nation—Israel—then it spread outward. That’s why He said to the Samaritan woman at the well: “Salvation is from the Jews.” (John 4:22).This pattern of beginning with one person or place is evidence that those who comfort themselves by saying “all religions are just different paths that all lead to God” are deceiving themselves and wasting both their time and their eternal lives! “Salvation is from the Jews”—meaning FROM JESUS ALONE!Now, because the time for the spread of that salvation had not yet come (since God operates according to seasons and appointed times), He told that Canaanite woman (a non-Jew) that He was sent only to Israel.But when the fullness of time had come—after His death and resurrection—we see Him now sending His apostles to the entire world.And the Bible clearly states:“Therefore, remember that formerly you who are Gentiles by birth and called ‘uncircumcised’ by those who call themselves ‘the circumcision’ (which is done in the body by human hands)—remember that at that time you were separate from Christ, excluded from citizenship in Israel and foreigners to the covenants of the promise, without hope and without God in the world. But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near by the blood of Christ.For he himself is our peace, who has made the two groups one and has destroyed the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility,by setting aside in his flesh the law with its commands and regulations. His purpose was to create in himself one new humanity out of the two, thus making peace,and in one body to reconcile both of them to God through the cross, by which he put to death their hostility.” (Ephesians 2:11–16).MeditateQuestion thingsAsk yourselfTake actionGod bless you greatly.It is I,Dr. Maxwell Shimba, servant of Jesus Christ,For Max Shimba Ministries OrgMAX SHIMBA MINISTRIES ORG ©2016.

    "full_content": "ISLAM DID NOT ORIGINATE FROM GOD: A Critical Inquiry into Islamic Religious LeadershipThursday, April 7, 2016By Dr. Maxwell ShimbaMax Shimba Ministries Org.IntroductionMany Muslims respond defensively when it is stated that Islam is a man-made religion. They often accuse critics of slander and falsehood, while failing to offer concrete scriptural evidence to defend their positions. Today, I pose a critical and theological inquiry directed to Muslims:Where in the Qur'an does Allah command the establishment of religious titles such as Imams, Sheikhs, or Ustaadhs?Theological Challenge to IslamMuslims are invited to present direct verses from the Qur'an that clearly authorize the creation or appointment of religious leaders with the titles ofImam,Sheikh, orUstaadh, along with their qualifications and roles. This call for evidence is not out of hostility but arises from a sincere desire for truth and clarity. If these roles are divinely ordained, as claimed, then surely there must be explicit Qur'anic support for them.To date, no verse has been cited that outlines these positions with clarity and divine authority. Instead, what is often presented isSurah Al-Baqarah 2:124, which reads:“And (remember) when Abraham was tried by his Lord with certain commands, which he fulfilled. He (Allah) said: ‘Indeed I will make you a leader (Imam) for the people.’ Abraham said: ‘And of my descendants?’ [Allah] said: ‘My covenant does not include the wrongdoers.’”This verse, however, refers specifically to Abraham’s divine testing and appointment, not to a systematic, replicable framework for religious leadership within Islam. It does not establish the office of “Imam” as a clerical title or provide qualifications for such an office in Islamic practice.Absence of Clerical Structure in the Qur'anThere is a notable absence of guidance in the Qur'an concerning thecriteria, responsibilities, or divine mandatefor individuals to bear titles likeImam,Sheikh, orUstaadh. If these positions are fundamental to Islamic religious life, as widely practiced, one would expect the Qur'an to offer detailed prescriptions concerning their qualifications, moral character, and appointment procedures.This lack of guidance raises theological and doctrinal concerns about theauthenticityanddivine originof such clerical titles within Islam. Their presence in Islamic societies appears more cultural or traditional rather than scripturally mandated.Contrast with Christian Leadership in the BibleIn contrast, the Bible offerscomprehensive and divinely inspired instructionsregarding church leadership. Scripture clearly identifies offices within the Church and outlines their qualifications:Christ is the head of the Church– the ultimate authority (Ephesians 1:22; 4:15; Colossians 1:18).Church autonomyis affirmed – local churches are self-governing under Christ’s headship (Titus 1:5).Spiritual leadershipis established through two primary offices –elders (bishops/pastors)anddeacons.Biblical Qualifications for Church LeadersBishops/Pastors:1 Timothy 3:1-7provides a detailed list of qualifications, including moral integrity, faithful family life, self-control, hospitality, teaching ability, and spiritual maturity.Deacons:1 Timothy 3:8-13outlines the requirements for deacons, including dignity, honesty, spiritual conviction, and a disciplined life. Their wives must also exhibit honorable character (verse 11).These offices are not cultural inventions butclearly instituted by divine instruction. Other supporting texts includeTitus 1:1–4,Titus 1:5–3:11, andTitus 2:11–15, which further affirm the structure and function of Christian leadership.ConclusionThe glaring lack of explicit Qur'anic guidance on the roles ofImam,Sheikh, orUstaadhsuggests that these areman-made constructs, not divine appointments. They lack scriptural authority and transparency in their origin and function. By contrast,the Bible provides robust, inspired criteria for religious leadership, grounded in divine order and spiritual integrity.I extend an open invitation to all Muslims to examine these truths and consider embracing the Christian faith, where God has clearly revealed His will concerning church leadership and governance. Christianity, unlike Islam, offers a spiritual structure ordained by God, grounded in Scripture, and manifest in the lives of Spirit-filled leaders.May the Lord bless you with wisdom and understanding.Dr. Maxwell ShimbaFounder, Max Shimba Ministries Org.",

Many people mistakenly assume that the God of the Bible, full of love, is the same as Allah of the Qur’an. This, however, is a grave misconception.The God revealed in the Bible is characterized by love and grace, while the Allah of the Qur’an, as we shall demonstrate, promotes hostility, hatred, and division. The Qur’an, which is the central text of Islam, shows that Allah commands his followers to harbor animosity toward Christians and Jews.1. Allah Forbids Friendship with Christians and JewsQur’an, Surah Al-Ma’idah 5:51\"O you who have believed, do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies. They are [in fact] allies of one another. And whoever is an ally to them among you – then indeed, he is [one] of them. Indeed, Allah guides not the wrongdoing people.\"If Allah is the same as Yahweh, the loving God of the Bible, why then does he forbid friendship with people of other faiths?Compare this to the commandment of Jesus Christ:Luke 6:35 (Holy Bible – SNT)\"But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High, because He is kind to the ungrateful and wicked.\"Clearly, the teachings of Jesus and the commands of Allah are diametrically opposed. The God of the Bible teaches us to love even our enemies. Allah promotes hatred.2. Allah Forbids Muslims from Loving Christians – Even Close FamilySurah Al-Mujādilah 58:22\"You will not find a people who believe in Allah and the Last Day having affection for those who oppose Allah and His Messenger, even if they were their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their kindred...\"This verse teaches that Muslims must not love those who do not follow Islam, even if they are family members. Such a position is starkly different from the teachings of the Bible, which emphasizes compassion, mercy, and familial responsibility.3. Allah Orders Muslims Not to Associate with Jews and ChristiansSurah An-Nisa 4:144\"O you who have believed, do not take the disbelievers as allies instead of the believers. Do you wish to offer Allah a clear case against yourselves?\"This kind of command encourages religious segregation and conflict. By contrast, the Bible repeatedly encourages unity, peace, and love for all people.4. Allah Warns Against Trusting Non-MuslimsSurah Al-Imran 3:118\"O you who have believed, do not take those outside your religion as confidants. They will not fail to ruin you; they wish you would have hardship. Hatred has already appeared from their mouths, and what their hearts conceal is greater...\"Again, this verse reflects a deep mistrust and animosity toward non-Muslims, which contradicts the character of God in the Bible who instructs us to walk in love and truth.5. Allah Declares Disbelievers as Open EnemiesSurah An-Nisa 4:101\"And when you travel throughout the land, there is no blame upon you for shortening the prayer [especially] if you fear that those who disbelieve may harm you. Indeed, the disbelievers are ever to you a clear enemy.\"This verse classifies all non-Muslims as enemies, further fueling religious division. Yet the God of the Bible declares:John 10:10-11\"The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I came that they may have life and have it abundantly. I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.\"The Lord Jesus brings life, not death. He heals, unites, and restores. The contrast is undeniable.6. Allah Commands Muslims to Fight and Kill DisbelieversSurah At-Tawbah 9:123\"O you who have believed, fight those adjacent to you of the disbelievers and let them find in you harshness. And know that Allah is with the righteous.\"Violence is normalized and even glorified under this command. Conversely, Jesus taught that\"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God\"(Matthew 5:9).7. Allah Declares Christians and Jews as Enemies Until They ConvertSurah Al-Mumtahanah 60:4\"...We disbelieve in you, and there has appeared between us and you animosity and hatred forever until you believe in Allah alone...\"This eternal hatred is entirely contrary to the heart of God revealed in Christ, who loves unconditionally and calls all people to repentance through grace.Jesus the Giver of Abundant LifeJesus, the Son of God, said:John 10:10\"The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I came that they may have life and have it abundantly.\"Satan's agenda has always been destruction. But Jesus came to bring life in its fullness—restoring, healing, and blessing every area of life: family, business, health, and relationships.If the enemy has stolen or destroyed anything in your life, remember:Jesus came so you may have life—life in abundance.Final ExhortationDear beloved,Do not allow hatred to rule your heart. Choose the path of love, peace, and salvation through Jesus Christ. The character of Allah, as seen in the Qur’an, bears no resemblance to the loving God revealed in the Holy Bible. Allah’s attributes reflect those of Satan—the deceiver, the divider, the destroyer. But Jesus Christ is the Good Shepherd, the Savior, and the Author of Life.If you feel convicted and want to surrender your life to Jesus, reach out to us. We will help you take the most important step in your life.Jesus loves you.In His service,Dr. Maxwell ShimbaServant of the Lord Jesus ChristShimba Theological Institute | Max Shimba Ministries OrgAll rights reserved.

Muhammad Says the Sun Wears a Garment, Which Causes Night DarknessDear reader,I have often said that Allah is not the Creator, but Muslims have been stubborn to accept this and instead begin insulting me. Today, I bring you another piece of evidence that Allah did not create, and Muhammad is a false prophet.What Did Muhammad and the Early Muslims Say About the Sun?Where would you go to find the correct meaning of the Quran? Zamakhshari? al-Tabari? Baidawi? If you were an early Muslim, you could go to Muhammad himself! Listen to how Muhammad explained it, according to Bukhari and al-Tabari:“Abu Dharr reported: The Prophet asked me at sunset, ‘Do you know where the sun goes (at sunset)?’ I replied, ‘Allah and His Messenger know best.’ He said, ‘It goes (i.e., it travels) until it prostrates itself beneath the Throne and seeks permission to rise again. It is then permitted. But a time will come when it will be about to prostrate, and its prostration will not be accepted...’”(Sahih Bukhari, Vol. 4, Book 54, Chapter 4, Hadith No. 441, p.283)Muhammad Says the Sun Prostrates Under Allah's ThroneAnother version of the same Bukhari hadith says:“Abu Dharr al-Ghifari (RA) narrated: One day, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) asked me, ‘Abu Dharr, do you know where the sun goes after it sets?’ I replied, ‘I do not know. Only the Messenger of Allah can explain it best.’ Then the Prophet (SA) answered, ‘After setting, the sun stays in prostration under the Throne (‘Arsh) and waits for Allah’s command to rise again from the east. A day will come when the sun will not be granted permission to rise, and Qiyamah (Judgment Day) will commence upon the earth.’”Muhammad Contradicts and Says the Sun Sets in the SkyMuhammad Says the Sun Wears a Garment/ClothingAccording toal-Tabari Volume 1, p.231, “I asked the Messenger of God [Muhammad], ‘Where does [the sun] set?’ He replied: ‘It sets in the heaven and then ascends from one heaven to another until it reaches the seventh heaven. Eventually, when it is beneath the Throne, it falls down in prostration, and the angels that oversee it also prostrate. Then the sun says, ‘My Lord, where do You command me to rise— from the place where I set or the place I rose from?’”He continued: This is what is meant by God's word:‘And the sun runs on its fixed course for a term (appointed). That is the Decree of the Almighty, the All-Knowing.’(Quran) – that is when the sun is held under the Throne.Then Gabriel brings the sun a garment of radiance taken from the light of the Throne, in proportion to hours and days. The garment is longer during summer and shorter in winter, and average in spring and autumn. [The seasons are said to be due to the garment’s length.]He continued: The sun wears this garment as one of you wears your robe. Then it is released to orbit the heavenly sphere until it rises from where it is commanded. … The same path is followed by the moon when it rises. But Gabriel brings a different garment from the light beneath God's feet. Thus, the meaning of God’s word:‘He made the sun a shining glory and the moon a derived light.’”The Sun and Moon as Signs of AllahSee also:Abu Dawud Vol. 1, Book 2, Hadith 1173, p.304Sunan al-Nasa’i Vol. 2, Hadith 1462–1506 (multiple pages listed)Dhu al-Qarnayn [Zul Qarnain] Witnesses the Sun Setting in a Muddy SpringAccording toal-Tabari Vol. 5, p.173-174(cf. Surah 18:82–97),Dhu al-Qarnayn “witnessed the sun setting in its resting place in a pool of black and foul-smelling mud.”al-Tabari Vol. 1, p.234also states that the sun sets in a muddy spring.The term \"muddy\" is translated from the Arabichami’ah, meaning dark clay or mud. However, a similar wordhamiyahcan also mean a scorching substance. (See footnote 442 on p.234.)“[Muhammad] continued. When the sun rises, it ascends on a chariot (pulled by horses) from one of those springs along with 360 angels…. When God wants to test the sun and moon to show His servants signs and thereby call them to obedience, the sun suddenly falls off its chariot into the depth of the sea, which is circular in shape.When God wants to intensify the warning sign to further frighten His servants, the entire sun falls in, leaving no part remaining on the chariot. This is a total eclipse of the sun, during which daylight is overtaken by darkness and stars appear.”(al-Tabari Vol. 1, p.236)Bibliography: Quran TranslationsArberry, Arthur J.The Koran Interpreted.

    "full_content": "Friday, April 1, 2016THE HERITAGE OF ISLAM FROM PAGAN RELIGIONS(PART ONE)Where did Allah come from?Islam claims that Allah is the same God who dealt with the Jews since the days of Abraham in the Old Testament. But is that really true?Islam began with Muhammad in the 600s AD. What were the beliefs of the Arabs before him? Are there any elements from those beliefs that made their way into Islam? In other words, is Islam free of paganism?Join me in this detailed analysis exploring the origins of Islam so we can discover whether there is any connection between Islam and the paganism that prevailed among Arab communities before the rise of Muhammad.The Origin of AllahHuman societies across the world have long pondered where the universe came from, the meaning of life, and what happens after death. As a result, every society developed a belief in a higher power (or powers) who were to be worshipped and invoked in times of trouble. These deities were known by different names in different communities, and each society developed a special means of communicating with these powers—that is, with their gods.One undeniable truth is this:except for the Jewish people, every other society in the world—whether African, European, Asian, etc.—began with pagan worship. These societies worshipped various gods, often represented by natural objects like mountains, trees, the sun, the moon, giant serpents, statues, and kings. For instance, the Romans had gods like Artemis, Jupiter, Minerva, Atlas. The Greeks had gods like Chronos, Dionysus, Eros, Ares, Apollo, Hermes, Poseidon. Indians had gods like Durga, Ganesha, Garusha, and Brahma.These pagan religions became widespread. Buddhism, for example, is a pagan religion that spread across much of Asia—India, Japan, Sri Lanka, China, etc.Thus, Arab societies, like other human communities, were no different—they too had their pagan worship systems. They worshipped what is known today as the“Star Family”—so called because they anthropomorphized their gods. Themoon was considered a male god, thesun his wife, and together they hadthree daughters:Al-Lat, Al-Uzza, and Manat.That’s why the Qur’an even says:\"Have you considered Al-Lat and Al-‘Uzza, and another, the third (goddess), Manat?\"(Surah 53:19–20)Even Muhammad used to worship these gods before founding Islam. According to Hisham al-Kalbi inKitab al-Asnam (Book of Idols), page 17:“We have been told that the Apostle of Allah once mentioned Al-Uzza saying, ‘I have offered a white sheep to Al-‘Uzza, while I was a follower of the religion of my people.’”His people were the Quraysh.The nameAllahcomes fromal-ilah. “Al” is like the English article “the”; and “ilah” means god. Soal-ilahmeans “the god.” Over time, through linguistic evolution, this was shortened toAllah, just like in Swahili one might say \"ndo ivo\" (meaning “that’s how it is”) instead of “ndiyo hivyo.”So, who wasAllah? He was themoon god, whose wife was the sun and whose daughters were Al-Lat, Al-Uzza, and Manat. These were the chief deities among the many gods worshipped by pre-Islamic Arabs during theJahiliyyah(Age of Ignorance).The nameAllahis masculine—hence the daughter is calledAl-Lat, a feminine version, just as in names likeFrancis(male) andFrancisca(female). The same applies toAllahandAl-Lat—same root, different gender.One tribe that notably worshipped Allah was theQuraysh, the tribe from which Muhammad came. Some people mistakenly believe that the nameAllahonly became known after Muhammad. Others argue that Allah was known since the time of Abraham in the same way He is known today. But if that were true, then how did the Allah of Abraham disappear and get replaced by a pagan moon god?Notably, Muhammad’s father was a pagan, not a Muslim. Some Muslims claim otherwise, but Muhammad himself said the following:Anas reported: A man asked the Messenger of Allah, \"Where is my father?\" He replied, \"In the Fire.\" When the man turned away, the Prophet called him back and said, \"Indeed, my father and your father are in the Fire.\"(Sahih Muslim, Book 001, Number 0398)If Muhammad’s father was a pagan,why was he named \"Abdullah\", meaning“servant of Allah”? That clearly indicates that even pagans in the Jahiliyyah era worshippedAllah, to the extent of naming their children after him—just as Jews named their children in honor of Yahweh:Joshua – Yahweh is salvationJotham – Yahweh is perfectJehoahaz – Yahweh has heldHezekiah – Yahweh strengthensElisha – God is salvationThe answer is clear:Allah was a pagan moon god, also known asHubal, who was worshipped not only by Arabs but across the Middle East. Archaeological evidence abounds showing the worship of the moon, sun, and stars was common throughout that region.Muhammad’s grandfather,Abdul Muttalib, almost sacrificed Muhammad’s fatherAbdullahas an offering toAllah. Instead, he was redeemed by sacrificing 100 camels—at the Kaaba!“An arrow showed that it was ‘Abdullah to be sacrificed. ‘Abdul-Muttalib then took the boy to Al-Ka'bah with a razor to slaughter the boy. Quraysh, his uncles from the Makhzum tribe, and his brother Abu Talib tried to dissuade him. They suggested he summon a female diviner, who ordered divination arrows to be drawn between Abdullah and 10 camels... the number of camels eventually reached one hundred.”(Ibn Hisham 1/151–155; Rahmat-ul-lil’alameen 2/89–90)That’s whyGod in the Bible consistently warned the Israelites not to worship the star family or heavenly hostslike the sun, moon, or stars:Deuteronomy 4:19“And beware not to lift up your eyes to heaven and see the sun and the moon and the stars—all the host of heaven—and be drawn away and worship them…”Deuteronomy 17:2–3“…and has gone and served other gods and worshiped them, or the sun or the moon or any of the heavenly host…”2 Kings 21:3, 5; 23:5Jeremiah 8:2; 19:13Zephaniah 1:5The Year Muhammad Was Born (570 AD)In the same year Muhammad was born,Abrahah al-Ashram, a ruler from Aksum (Ethiopia) stationed in Yemen, sought to destroy the Kaaba. He built a cathedral in Sana’a hoping to rival Mecca’s pagan pilgrimage but failed.So, he marched toward Mecca with a large army and elephants—hence,“The Year of the Elephant.”Quraysh tribes united to defend the Kaaba. Muhammad’s grandfatherAbdul Muttalibsaid:“The Owner of this House is its Defender, and I am sure He will save it from the attack of the adversaries and will not dishonor the servants of His House.”Islamic tradition says birds dropped stones on Abrahah’s army, defeating them. The Qur’an records this inSurah Al-Fil 105:1–5:“Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with the people of the elephant? Did He not make their plot go astray? And He sent against them birds in flocks, striking them with stones of baked clay, and made them like chewed straw.”But this happenedbefore Islam, during apagan era, when the Kaaba was full of pagan idols. Abdul Muttalib didn’t know the Allah of Muhammad.So who was the “Lord” who defended the Kaaba according to Qur’an 105? It could only have been the samepagan god Allahworshipped at that time—not the God of the Bible.ConclusionIf you are a Muslim, ask yourself:Why is themoonso central to your religious calendar?Why must the moon be sighted beforefasting beginsorends?Why is thecrescent moon and starthe main symbol atop every mosque?What is the origin of these symbols?http://maxshimba.blogspot.com/…/urithi-wa-uislamu-kutoka-kw…God bless you all.By permissionI am Dr. Maxwell Shimba, a servant of Jesus Christ,For Max Shimba Ministries Org,©2016.

He responded by saying that it is permissible to hunt hyenas. He asked if it was permissible to eat them, and he responded that eating hyena is halal (permissible).He asked again, \"Did the Prophet of Allah (SAW) permit eating hyenas?\" Jabir replied, \"YES, the Prophet of Allah permitted eating hyenas.\" [Abu Dawud 3801, T 1798, Ibn e Majah 3085, Ahmedl4456]9- Kitabu cha HAJJAs we read above, Muslims are allowed to eat hyena meat. Moreover, Muhammad permitted eating lizard meat.PROPHET MUHAMMAD SAID EATING LIZARD MEAT IS HALALSahih Muslim Book 21, Number 4788:Ibn 'Umar reported that some people were with the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) among his companions, including Sa'd. Then a lizard was brought and placed before the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). A woman among the wives of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, \"It is lizard meat.\" Thereupon the Prophet Muhammad said, \"Eat it, for it is lawful (halal).”Muslims claim eating pork is haram, but they eat hyenas and lizards. They say eating pork is haram, but they consume camels. This is quite contradictory.A question to ponder: If Jehovah, the God of Moses, is the same as Allah of the Muslims, why do Muslims contradict the verse about eating camels?Leviticus 7:4:\"Moreover, these you shall not eat among those that chew the cud or those that have cloven hooves: the camel, because it chews the cud but does not have cloven hooves, is unclean to you.\"Furthermore, Muslims drink camel urine and milk. Is this not breaking the commandment stated in Leviticus 7:4?Abdallah Ibn Umar said that eating camel meat and drinking its milk is HARAM. Yet Muslims continue to eat camel meat and drink its milk and urine. (‘Abdallah Ibn ‘Umar al-Baydawi, Tafsir al-baydawi)MUHAMMAD ALLOWED MUSLIMS TO DRINK CAMEL URINE AND MILK, WHICH IS HARAM IN [LEVITICUS 7:4]Nevertheless, Muhammad instructed some people to follow his shepherd and drink the camel's milk and urine.Bukhari Volume 7, Book 71, Hadith 589, 590, and Volume 7, Book 71, Hadith 623.Muhammad also said that camel urine is a good remedy.Ibn-i-Majah Volume 5, Book 31, Hadith 3503.Some Muslims were told to drink camel urine, but they ended up rebelling and killing the shepherd. Muhammad ordered their hands and feet to be cut off and their eyes to be branded.Sunan Nasa’i Volume 1, Hadith 308-309. See also Bukhari Volume 4, Book 52, Hadith 261.Now, if camels are haram inLeviticus 7:4, why did Muhammad permit Muslims to eat its meat and drink its urine and milk?Why do Muhammad and Allah allow the consumption and drinking of camel meat and urine, which is prohibited in Leviticus?This is a significant contradiction for Muslims and the Prophet Muhammad for breaking God's commandment not to eat the meat of camels, lizards, hyenas, and hares.Welcome to Jesus, the living and great God,God bless you all,In His Service,Max Shimba Ministries Org.MAX SHIMBA MINISTRIES ORG ©2016.

I hear many narrations (Hadiths) from you but I forget them.' Allah's Messenger said, 'Spread your garment.' I did accordingly and then he moved his hands as if scooping something and emptied it into my garment and said, 'Take and wrap this sheet over your body.' I did it and after that I never forgot anything.\" (Bukhari Volume 1, Book 3, Hadith 119). Also found in Bukhari Volume 4, Book 56, Hadith 841; Bukhari Volume 9, Book 23, Hadith 452.\"Abu Huraira narrated: The Prophet said, 'If a fly falls in the vessel of any of you, let him dip all of it (into the vessel) and then throw it away, for in one of its wings there is a disease and in the other there is healing (antidote for the disease).'\" (Bukhari Volume 7, Book 71, Hadith 673).The footnotes explain that modern medicine has found that flies carry pathogens on some parts of their bodies, but they also carry antidotes for these pathogens. This explanation suggests that dipping the fly releases the antidote to counteract the disease.Muhammad Says Drinking Camel Urine Is MedicineUsing Camel Urine as a Cure:According to Muhammad, people are punished in their graves for defiling themselves with urine. (Bukhari Volume 1, Book 4, Hadith 215; Bukhari Volume 1, Book 4, Hadith 217).However, Muhammad instructed some people to follow his shepherd and drink the camel's milk and urine as a remedy. (Bukhari Volume 7, Book 71, Hadith 589, 590 and Volume 7, Book 71, Hadith 623).Muhammad also said that camel urine is a good remedy. (Ibn-i-Majah Volume 5, Book 31, Hadith 3503).Some Muslims were told to drink camel urine and ended up rebelling and killing the shepherd. Muhammad ordered their hands and feet to be cut off and their eyes to be branded. (Sunan Nasa’i Volume 1, Hadith 308-309). See also Bukhari Volume 4, Book 52, Hadith 261.Religious Incantations as a Remedy for Scorpion Stings:Muhammad used incantations to remove the poison from scorpion stings. (Sahih Muslim Volume 3, Book 24, Hadith 5442-5444, 5448).Muhammad and Other Remedies:There is no disease that does not have a cure according to Sahih Muslim Volume 3, Page 1199, 1200.Allah has made a remedy for every disease except old age. (Abu Dawud Volume 3, Hadith 3846).An entire book in Ibn-i-Majah (Volume 5) is dedicated to medicine. It states that every disease except old age has a remedy. (Ibn-i-Majah Volume 5, Hadith 3436, Page 1).Muhammad advised people with pain in their legs to apply henna. (Abu Dawud Volume 3, Hadith 3849).Collyrium (an eye wash) makes the eyes bright and promotes the growth of eyelashes. (Ibn-i-Majah Volume 5, Book 31, Hadith 3497, Page 35).Disclaimer:The footnotes quote a doctor from the Department of Hadith; they did not get a quote from the Department of Medicine or Health.One wing of a fly has a disease and the other has the cure. (Abu Dawud Volume 3, Hadith 3835).If a fly falls into the drink, dip the other wing into the drink. (Ibn-i-Majah Volume 5, Hadith 3504-3505).Muhammad and Clean Water:Regarding health control by removing impure water and waste: When asked about drinking water from a well containing menstrual rags, dead dogs, and stinking things, Muhammad said that water is always pure and is not defiled by anything. (Abu Dawud Volume 1, Chapter 35, Hadith 66-67).Conclusion:These teachings highlight the significant differences in understanding and approach to health and medicine between Islamic traditions and modern science.Today, we have learned something about Islam, which relies more on worldly matters rather than trusting in the living God.Sincerely,Dr. Max Shimba, a servant of Jesus Christ, the Great God.

First, let's look at the clear meaning of Surah 18:85-86, and then we will look at some Muslim explanations and responses to this issue.A Little AstronomyIt may not be widely known that the Abbasid Muslim rulers, Arabs, and Persians made significant advancements in astronomy, naming many stars, and even correcting some of Ptolemy’s astronomical tables. However, the sun is many times larger than the entire Earth, and the Earth orbits around the sun. The sun does not set in a muddy spring.Who is Zul-Qarnain?We have no evidence that Muhammad ever told anyone who Zul-Qarnain actually was. Muslims have four different views.Alexander the Great (of Macedonia): This is the view held by most Muslims. Zul-Qarnain means \"the man with two horns.\" There is a fabricated legend that Alexander the Great was a god and had two ram's horns growing from the sides of his head. Despite the fact that this wasn't true (and it would be problematic to find a helmet that could fit), this legend was known, and many Muslims think that Allah mentioned Alexander in Surah 18 by this name.Cyrus I of Persia: This is another view. His kingdom was essentially a dual kingdom of the Medes and Persians, but there is no evidence that the two horns refer to him.A king of Yemenwho wore a helmet with two ram’s horns, is another view held by some Muslims.An unknown person: This is the fourth view. However, it doesn’t seem very helpful to give an explanation about someone whom the speaker has never heard of.Conclusion: It doesn’t matter who Zul-Qarnain was. If he discovered that the sun sets in a spring of muddy water, and it doesn’t set in a spring of muddy water, then this is false regardless of who Muhammad was talking about.Surah 18 Thoughts and ResponsesIdea 1: The sun sets in a spring of muddy water!For early Muslims, the Quran taught that this actually happens. The early Muslim historian al-Tabari, volume 1, page 234, shows this. Another example is “[Dhu al-Qarnaiyn] saw the setting of the sun in its resting place in a black, muddy spring.” According to al-Tabari volume 5, pages 173-174, Dhu Qarnain [Zul Qarnain] is also found in al-Tabari volume 1, page 371.Another related thing is that the Earth sits on a large fish according to al-Tabari volume 1, page 220 (839-923 CE).Idea 2: The sun appeared to Alexander to set in the lake of Ithaca in MacedoniaThis idea assumes that Zul-Qarnain was Alexander, and that Alexander was a good Muslim. This idea does not fit with the fact that Alexander had a temple built for himself. Additionally, Alexander went to conquer lands northwest of Ithaca, which is modern Albania.Even worse for this idea, Greeks had settlements hundreds of miles west of Ithaca, including in Spain, Sicily, etc., for at least five hundred years before Alexander. Why would a very intelligent Greek think the sun set in a lake in Macedonia when Greek ships were sailing far west of Alexander’s country? Furthermore, Tertullian in \"A Treatise on the Soul\" chapter 49, page 227, says that Aristotle, who lived at the same time, mentions a hero from the island of Sardinia far west of Macedonia but about the same latitude.Idea 3: The “spring of muddy water” is the Atlantic OceanThe Atlantic Ocean is not muddy and not black; it is blue-green. Also, it is not a spring but an ocean. The sun does not set in the ocean. More importantly, Alexander, Cyrus I of Persia, and the kings of Yemen never went to the Atlantic Ocean, and Surah 18:85-86 says Zul Qarnain saw or witnessed this.Any one of these four reasons is enough to dismiss this idea, so why do some Muslims propose this? This shows the lengths they go to in order to show that Surah 18:1-2 is not false. If the Allah of Islam thought this idea was true in the Quran, and Allah knew this idea was false, then this would be a lie. If the Allah of Islam did not know this fact, they would not have the knowledge and certainly not the power to know everything. If these verses did not come from the Allah of Islam, then the Quran would have an obvious error, as it attributes this falsehood to Allah when it was not so. Of course, if the Allah of Islam does not really exist, and the true God is not the author of the Quran, then the Allah of Islam did not lie because he does not exist.Idea 4: The “spring of muddy water” is where Cyrus I looked at the Black SeaEven if Cyrus I went to the eastern shore of the Black Sea, how would the sun appear to set in the Black Sea if he had already passed the eastern shore heading south and east? We have no evidence that Cyrus ever traveled to the region that includes modern Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, etc., east of the Black Sea.A Muslim would have a slightly weaker argument if they said Cyrus saw the sun rising from the Black Sea, as he passed through to Greece, but the Quran talks about the sun setting. However, the Black Sea is not a spring, and everyone from the Egyptians to those far north knew the sun did not set in the Black Sea.Idea 5: The “spring of muddy water” is where Cyrus I looked at the Aegean SeaBut the Persians knew very well the Athenians, Spartans (original Greeks), and other Greeks. The Persians would know that the Greeks were not on the other side of the sun.Idea 6: The “spring of muddy water” is where a king looked at the Red SeaYemenis (Sabaeans/Shebans) were always aware of the Abyssinians (Ethiopians) across the river. If they thought the sun set in the Red Sea, then the Abyssinians would be the people on the other side where the sun was.Idea 7: The “spring of muddy water” is a metaphorIf this was not real but a metaphor for something else, then the Quran failed to explain that it was not real, and the idea would be misleading. Furthermore, no one can say for certain what this metaphor referred to.There is nothing in the Quran that indicates this was not real, and most early Muslims took it as literal truth. Considering that they knew the actual meaning of this from Muhammad’s followers, they were misled by Surah 18.Idea 8: Muhammad was recounting a dreamThis idea does not identify who Zul-Qarnain was. If Muhammad was recounting a dream, the sun could set wherever he wanted it to. Even if it is not clear who this mythical figure saw something totally false, and people believed it to be true, how would that teach us to believe the truth?However, if someone said they saw someone named ‘Ali doing some amazing things, and millions of people believed in him for many centuries, how could that person be a liar if they forgot to tell people that \"it was just my dream, and I did not see Ali doing this with my eyes\"?ConclusionRegardless of who Zul-Qarnain was, the Quran presents this as truth that the sun sets in a spring of muddy water. Even people 1,000 years before Muhammad knew the sun did not set in Spain. This idea was not a metaphor because no early Muslim took it as such or provided an alternative meaning as a metaphor, and all early Muslims believed the Quran was not meant to deceive.List of Quranic CommentariesArberry, Arthur J.

However, upon further reading of the Qur'an, a significant theological contradiction arises—challenging the consistency of this claim.Surah Yunus 10:90–92: Pharaoh’s Supposed ConversionSurah Yunus 10:90–92states:90: “We took the Children of Israel across the sea. Pharaoh and his soldiers pursued them out of transgression and enmity. When he was about to drown, he said,‘I believe that there is no deity except the One in whom the Children of Israel believe, and I am among the Muslims!’91:‘Now? But you disobeyed before and were among the corrupters.’92:‘So today We will preserve your body so that you may be a sign for those after you. And indeed, many among mankind are heedless of Our signs.’This passage clearly portrays Pharaoh as declaring his faith in the God of the Children of Israel and submitting at the moment of death. Many Islamic scholars, includingMuhammad AsadinThe Message of the Qur'an(Dar al-Andalus Limited, Gibraltar, 1993, p. 306, fn. 112), interpret this as Pharaoh becoming a Muslim before his death and being forgiven.The Theological Dilemma: Contradictions in the Qur'anHowever, this interpretation raises profound theological concerns when we compare it with other Qur'anic verses thatseemingly contradictthis account.1. Surah An-Nisa’ 4:17–18: Toba (Repentance) Must Be Timely17: “Verily, repentance with Allah is only for those who do evil in ignorance and then repent soon after. It is they to whom Allah will turn in forgiveness.”18: “But repentance is not accepted from those who continue to do evil deeds until death faces one of them and he says:‘Now I repent.’Nor of those who die as disbelievers; for them We have prepared a painful punishment.”Observation:According to these verses, repentance at the point of death—after a life of knowing rebellion—is not accepted. Pharaoh, who willfully opposed Moses and committed evil knowingly, clearly does not fit the Qur'anic criteria of“those who sin in ignorance”. Hence, the Qur'an itself appears toinvalidate Pharaoh’s deathbed repentance.2. Surah Ghafir 40:83–85: Repentance After Punishment Is Not Accepted83: “When their messengers came to them with clear signs, they arrogantly disbelieved in what they had been given of knowledge...”84: “Then when they saw Our punishment, they said,‘We believe in Allah alone and disbelieve in what we used to associate with Him.’”85: “But their faith was of no benefit to them once they saw Our punishment. Such is Allah’s established way with His servants. And the disbelievers then were utterly lost.”Observation:This passage underscores that faith or repentance after witnessing divine punishment isineffective and unacceptable. Again, this disqualifies Pharaoh’s last-minute submission, as it occurred preciselyafterhe had seen the punishment—the drowning in the sea.Contradiction Within the Qur'an?If, according to Surah Yunus 10:90–92, Pharaoh’s repentance is preserved as a sign, but other verses such as Surah An-Nisa 4:17–18 and Surah Ghafir 40:83–85 state that repentance at the point of death or during punishment is rejected, then the Qur’an seems to be ininternal contradiction. Does Allah forgive those who repent at the brink of death—or not?Moreover, a serious theological paradox arises concerning Muslim funerary practices. Muslims pray for forgiveness for the dead—even though, by Qur’anic logic, the dead have already tasted death and thus, are beyond repentance (as per 4:18). How, then, is forgiveness expected?The Call to Certainty in Jesus ChristAs I continued to study the Qur’an, I encountered numerous such contradictions—raising fundamental doubts about its consistency and divine authorship. Can a God who claims to be all-knowing and wise contradict Himself within His own revelation?In stark contrast, theHoly Bible is clear and consistentin presenting salvation through Jesus Christ. Jesus Himself declared:“I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.”(John 14:6)And the apostles affirmed:“Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved.”(Acts 4:12)An Invitation to Salvation Through ChristDo you want to give your life to Jesus Christ today so He may save you and give you eternal life? Receiving Jesus means acknowledging Him as the only Savior and Lord.Pray This Prayer of Salvation“O Holy God, I come before You. I confess that I am a sinner. Please forgive all my sins. I repent with all my heart. I ask that the blood of Jesus Christ, shed on the cross for me, cleanse me now—spirit, soul, and body. I open my heart. Lord Jesus Christ, I welcome You into my life. Come in by the power of Your Holy Spirit. Be my Lord and Savior now and forever. Make me the person You desire me to be. Thank You for forgiving me and saving me. I surrender to serve You all the days of my life. Satan has no authority over me—In Jesus’ Name. Amen.”If you prayed this prayer sincerely and with faith, then you are now saved, and all your sins are forgiven. The blood of Jesus now covers you.Next Steps After SalvationPray daily and speak with God–(John 15:7)Read the Bible daily–(Acts 17:11)Allow the Holy Spirit to lead your life–(Galatians 5:16–25; Romans 8:14–17)Trust God in all things–(1 Peter 5:7; Zechariah 4:6)Fellowship regularly with other believers–(Hebrews 10:25)Reject sin and live a holy life–(James 4:7–8)Witness to others about your new faith–(Matthew 10:32–33; Romans 1:16)ConclusionCongratulations on your new life in Christ. You are now anew creation. May you walk in His blessings, truth, and power from now on.In Christ’s service,Dr. Max ShimbaServant of Jesus Christ, our Great God and Savior (Titus 2:13)For Max Shimba Ministries OrgMarch 20, 2016©2016 All Rights Reserved",

Read Matthew 22:32, \"...I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? He is not the God of the dead but of the living.\"Mark 12:27, \"He is not the God of the dead but the God of the living.\"The Bible assures us that God is not the God of the dead, unlike the late Muhammad in the Quran, who is prayed for daily by Allah and his angels. Let's read a verse from the Quran:Surah Al-Ahzab 56, \"Indeed, Allah and His angels send blessings upon the Prophet. O you who have believed, ask [ Allah to confer] blessing upon him and ask [ Allah to grant him] peace.\"Muslims are commanded to pray for the deceased Muhammad, who is still in his grave today, awaiting judgment from his Creator, Jesus.Imam Amirul Mu’minin Ali (a) said:\"Visit the graves of the deceased, for they feel joy when you visit them. Ask for whatever you need at the grave of your father and mother after praying for them.\" Al-Akhlaq wa al-Aadab al-Islamiyyah compiled by Hay’at Muhammad al-Amin, Qum.Imam al-Sadiq (a) urges Muslims to visit graves because the dead, through Allah, know when you visit them and feel joy when you do so. Abu Muhammad Zaynu’l ‘Abidin, Manifestations of the All-Merciful:The dead are grateful when you visit their graves, and they feel lonely when you leave.Alseraj.netThe above testimonies confirm that ISLAM is a religion of the dead, and they believe that the deceased, who have decayed and been eaten by termites in their graves, hear them and are present in those graves. But what happens on the first night when a Muslim is buried? Read this astonishing story from an authentic hadith.THE FIRST NIGHT OF A MUSLIM IN THE GRAVE:[Hasan: At-Tirmidhee from Abu Hurairah.]The Prophet of Allah (sallAllahu 'alaihi wa sallam) said, when a deceased person is buried, two angels, one black and the other blue, called Al Munkar and Al Nakeer, come to him. They talk to the deceased and ask, \"What did you say about this man?\" He says what he used to say, \"He is the servant of Allah and His messenger. I testify that there is no deity worthy of worship but Allah, and Muhammad is His servant and messenger.\" The angels then say, \"We knew you would say this,\" and his grave is widened to seventy by seventy cubits, illuminated for him, and they say, \"Sleep.\" He says, \"Let me return to my family to inform them...\"Muhammad said, \"The deceased hears the footsteps of their relatives when they leave the grave...\" [Saheeh: Al-Bukhaaree (2/422), Muslim, Ahmad, Abu Daud, an-Nasaa.ee: from Anas.]Al-Baraa b. 'Azib said, we went to a grave, and we found a man who had not yet been buried, so the Prophet of Allah asked the deceased, \"Do you submit to Allah?\"... [Saheeh: Ahmad, Abu Dawud (3/4735) Ibn Khuzaimah, al-Haakim, al-Baihaqee in 'Shu'ab ul-Imaan', ad-Diyaa: from al-Baraa.]The hadith above confirms that Islam is a RELIGION OF THE DEAD, while the Bible states that God is not the God of the dead but of the living.CONTINUE:The practice of the Prophet (Swalla Allaahu ‘alayhi wa aalihi wa sallam) after burial was to stand by the grave and say, \"Ask Allah for forgiveness for your brother and pray for him to be steadfast, for he is now being questioned.\" (Abu Daawuud).NOW MUSLIMS PRAY FOR THE DEAD WITH QURANThe dead are prayed for in the following manner:The Imam (prayer leader) stands at the head of the deceased if the deceased is a man, as established in the Hadith of Abu Ghaalibi al-Khayyaat, who said:\"I witnessed Anas bin Malik praying for a deceased man, and he stood by his head.\"The Imam also stands by the middle of the body if the deceased is a woman, as established in the Hadith of Samurah bin Jundub, who said:\"I prayed behind the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he prayed for the mother of Ka'ab...he stood by her middle.\"Then, the Imam will say the takbir (saying 'Allah is the Greatest') four or five or nine times, as all these forms have been established from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). However, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) often said the takbir four times.Allah and Muhammad continue to say, \"Pray for forgiveness for the deceased...,\" \"Pray for your brother's forgiveness and ask Allah to make him steadfast, for he is now being questioned.\" [36] as narrated by ‘Uthmaan bin ‘Affaan.This implies that you, as a Muslim, can continue to sin without worry because, upon death, your relatives will pray for your forgiveness. This is a BIG LIE.Praying for the dead encourages sinners to continue sinning, believing that after death, the church will pray for them to enter heaven. Dear friend, I tell you again, SALVATION IS NOW.Luke 16:26 says, \"And besides all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, so that those who want to pass from here to you cannot, nor can those from there pass to us.\" The Bible shows that the dead are either in paradise or in hell.WHAT DOES THE BIBLE SAY ABOUT THE DEAD?God accepts a sinner who repents wholeheartedly and sanctifies himself based on faith alone in the blood of Jesus Christ. He then grants him eternal life. 2 Corinthians 6:2 says, \"(For He says, 'In an acceptable time I have heard you, And in the day of salvation I have helped you.' Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation).\"The Bible tells us that after a person dies, they are taken to heaven or hell based on whether they accepted or rejected Christ as their Savior. For believers, death is leaving the body to be with the Lord (2 Corinthians 5:6-8; Philippians 1:23). For non-believers, death means eternal judgment in hell (Luke 16:22-23).This is where the confusion about what happens after death arises. Revelation 20:11-15 describes those in hell being cast into the lake of fire. Revelation 21 and 22 talk about a new heaven and a new earth. Therefore, it means that until the final resurrection, after death, one remains in a place resembling heaven or hell. The place where a person is to reside permanently will not change, but temporary dwellings will. Sometime after death, believers will be taken to the new heaven and new earth (Revelation 21:1), and non-believers to the lake of fire (Revelation 20:11-15). These are the eternal dwelling places based on whether one believed in Jesus Christ alone for salvation from their sins.Muslims, after death, it is judgment, and there is no praying for the dead's forgiveness. The time to set your life right is now and not to wait for intercessions after death. That is a trap set by Satan in the straight path of Allah.How about you? How prepared are you for death?Life here on earth is uncertain; we may not see tomorrow. Death comes suddenly, and the Bible warns, \"Come now, you who say, 'Today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a city, spend a year there, buy and sell, and make a profit'; whereas you do not know what will happen tomorrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapor that appears for a little time and then vanishes away.\" (James 4:13-14). The Bible also says, \"For He says: 'In an acceptable time I have heard you, And in the day of salvation I have helped you.' Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.\" (2 Corinthians 6:2). Start today, while there is still time, believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God (John 8:24). He is the way, the truth, and the life (John 14:6). Only in the name of Jesus Christ can we be saved (Acts 4:11-12). Repent of all your sins (Acts 17:30-31). Confess that Jesus Christ is the Son of God (Acts 8:37). Be buried with Him in baptism for the remission of your sins (Romans 6:4; Acts 22:16). Then serve Christ in His Church for the rest of your life, and you will be blessed.Today we have learned the difference between DEATH in Islam and Christianity. Muslims believe in praying for the dead's forgiveness, while Christians believe that salvation is now.God bless you.I am Dr. Max Shimba, a servant of Jesus Christ, the Great God.For Max Shimba Ministries Org,MAX SHIMBA MINISTRIES ORG ©2016.

    "full_content": "Wednesday, January 20, 2016JESUS IS GOD ACCORDING TO THE QURAN – KING OF KINGSBelievers of the Islamic faith, through their religious preachers in various religious lectures, have often argued that Jesus Christ is not God on the grounds that God cannot be born.Dear reader, I urge you to follow this lesson carefully so that you may know the truth about the divinity of Jesus Christ in the Quran:Does Jesus possess the unique attributes of God according to the Quran?Let us begin our investigation by reading the Quran and seeing for ourselves whether Jesus is truly God or not.GOD IS KINGThe First Attribute according to the Quran: God is King.The Quran states that one of God’s attributes is “King.” Does Jesus possess this attribute of “King”? Let us read the Quran first.Quran 59:23:He is Allah, besides Whom there is no god, the King, the Holy, the Giver of peace, the Granter of security, Guardian over all, the Mighty, the Compeller, the Supreme; Glory be to Allah from that which they associate (with Him).Now, let us see if Jesus truly has this attribute of King, which is a unique attribute of God according to the Quran.The Holy Bible says the following about Jesus Christ:Revelation 17:14They will make war against the Lamb, but the Lamb will overcome them, because he is Lord of lords and King of kings.In this verse, we read that Jesus is called “King of Kings,” which is an attribute of Almighty God as witnessed in Quran Surah 59:23. Therefore, Allah and the Quran have affirmed that Jesus is God because the Bible confirms that Jesus is the King of Kings in Revelation 17:14.Let us continue with another piece of evidence from the Quran which assures us that Jesus is God.GOD IS HOLYThe Second Attribute according to the Quran: God is Holy.Does Jesus have this attribute of “Holy”? Let us read the Quran first:Quran 59:23He is Allah, besides Whom there is no god, the King, the Holy, the Giver of peace, the Granter of security, Guardian over all, the Mighty, the Compeller, the Supreme; Glory be to Allah from that which they associate (with Him).In the Quran, we have read that one of the attributes of God is “Holy.” Does Jesus have this attribute of holiness?Go to that same Quran,19:19:The angel said, \"Indeed, I am only a messenger of your Lord to give you a pure son\"—Isa (Jesus) son of Mary.That same Quran confirms and answers us that Jesus, known as Isa son of Maryam in the Quran, is the Holy Son. Therefore, this attribute of holiness, which belongs to God alone, we read in the Quran, which was revealed by Allah, that Jesus possesses it. Jesus is called the Holy Son.THE LORD IS ALMIGHTY GODThe Third Attribute according to the Quran: The Lord is Almighty God.Let us open the Quran and read about the Lord:Quran 3:39While he was standing in prayer in the chamber, the angels called to him: \"Allah gives you glad tidings of Yahya (John), confirming (the word) from Allah, noble, chaste, and a prophet among the righteous.\"Quran 39:29Allah presents an example: a slave owned by quarreling partners and another belonging exclusively to one man—are they equal in comparison? Praise be to Allah! But most of them do not know.Quran 39:29 says that Almighty God is Lord, and that is a praiseworthy attribute of God. Furthermore, that same Quran (Quran 3:39) says that Isa son of Maryam is the Word from Allah and is Lord. The Quran answers us that the attribute of Lord, which belongs to God alone, is given to Jesus. Now let us read the Bible for more evidence about Jesus being Lord.Revelation 17:14They will make war against the Lamb, but the Lamb will overcome them, because he is Lord of lords and King of kings.In Revelation, we read that the Lamb, who is Jesus Christ, is called Lord of Lords. Therefore, this attribute of “Lord,” which is exclusively God’s, we read in the Quran, which was revealed by Allah, that Jesus is Lord and has acquired it. Likewise, in the Holy Bible, we have read that Jesus is called Lord, which is an exclusive attribute of God according to the Quran.Today I have answered the question of Muslims: Is Jesus God? The Quran and Allah both affirm that Jesus is God because Jesus possesses all the attributes and/or honors of God.In His service,Dr. Maxwell ShimbaCopyright © Max Shimba Ministries 2013",

This act of faith brings spiritual life and physical health to the believer where it was lacking. Remember, many who were healed of their physical ailments were also healed in their souls.So, why did Allah's command to Jibril to pray for the healing of His Prophet Muhammad from an illness caused by eating poison not work?Thus, healing is not performed by any person but by God. Even specialist doctors do not heal; they only provide treatment. The healer is God. Only the servants of God act as a bridge or instrument to bring about the healing released by the Lord to the needy person.LET'S NOW READ ABOUT ALLAH AND JIBRIL IN THEIR ATTEMPT TO HEAL MUHAMMAD:Ibn Sa'd, Page 265:Aisha, the wife of the Prophet Muhammad, used to say, \"When the Prophet of Allah was ill, Jibril would pray for Muhammad to Allah by saying these words: 'In the name of Allah, may He heal you from every illness and pain and from all those who are evil against you and those who wish you harm. You will be healed.'\"Did the name of Allah heal Muhammad? Let's read the Sahih hadith as brought by Al Bukhari:MUHAMMAD'S RESPONSE AFTER BEING PRAYED FOR HEALING BY ALLAH/JIBRIL:Bukhari's Hadith 5.713:Narrated by 'Aisha:The Prophet Muhammad, when he was ill and taken by death, used to say, \"O Aisha, I still feel severe pain from the poisoned food I ate at Khaibar, and now I feel as if my aorta is being cut from that poison I ate.\"Can God pray and fail? Why did the healing prayers of Allah and Jibril for Muhammad not work?NOW LET'S READ ABOUT JESUS IN THE BIBLE, DID HE HEAL PEOPLE?“When Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw Peter’s mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever. He touched her hand, and the fever left her; and she got up and began to wait on him.” Matthew 8:14-15The Bible does not tell us that Jesus prayed for this woman; instead, we see that Jesus touched her hand, and the fever left her. Just a touch from a man of God is sufficient medicine, even if he does not pray because the anointing is within him. Even Peter could heal the sick with his shadow alone due to the anointing (Acts 5:15).THE IMPORTANCE OF PUTTING YOUR FAITH IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST“Now Peter and John were going up to the temple at the time of prayer—at three in the afternoon. Now a man who was lame from birth was being carried to the temple gate called Beautiful, where he was put every day to beg from those going into the temple courts. When he saw Peter and John about to enter, he asked them for money. Peter looked straight at him, as did John. Then Peter said, 'Look at us!' So the man gave them his attention, expecting to get something from them. Then Peter said, 'Silver or gold I do not have, but what I do have I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk.' Taking him by the right hand, he helped him up, and instantly the man’s feet and ankles became strong. He jumped to his feet and began to walk.” (Acts 3:1-8)If you follow the story of this healed crippled man, you will see that he had been that way from birth and was over forty years old when he was healed (Acts 4:22).What was the secret of this miracle? Did this crippled man get healed by the power of Peter and John or by the power of the name of Jesus Christ?I ask these questions because many people, when they see someone being used by God in healing, put their faith in that person instead of putting their faith in the name of Jesus Christ.And that’s what happened when this crippled man was healed; the people in the temple were amazed at Peter and John as if the crippled man had been healed by their power, which was not true. When Peter saw this, he decided to explain the truth to the people; he said:“While the man held on to Peter and John, all the people were astonished and came running to them in the place called Solomon’s Colonnade. When Peter saw this, he said to them: ‘Fellow Israelites, why does this surprise you? Why do you stare at us as if by our own power or godliness we had made this man walk?’” (Acts 3:11-12).Peter was doing something important here by helping to change the people's mindset that the power to heal this man was from Peter and John, which was not true. If this power was not theirs, what was the secret of this miracle? Peter continued to say:“The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his servant Jesus... By faith in the name of Jesus, this man whom you see and know was made strong. It is Jesus’ name and the faith that comes through him that has completely healed him, as you can all see.” (Acts 3:13-16).Consider these words of Peter: \"By faith in the name of Jesus, this man whom you see and know was made strong.\" Peter and John put their faith in the name of Jesus Christ. They were confident in their hearts that the secret of miracles lies in the name of Jesus Christ—that's why when they met this crippled man, they commanded him to walk in that name!Put your faith in the name of Jesus Christ if you want to see the signs and miracles of Jesus Christ in your life and those you minister to. Knowing this, the first disciples of Jesus Christ, when they were forbidden to \"speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus\" by the high priest Annas, they prayed, saying: \"...Now, Lord, consider their threats and enable your servants to speak your word with great boldness. Stretch out your hand to heal and perform signs and wonders through the name of your holy servant Jesus.\" (Acts 4:18, 29-31)It is important to tell and remind people of the importance of putting their faith in the name of Jesus Christ if they want to see the hand of the Lord healing, performing signs, and miracles.Dear reader, why waste your time with traditional healers or charmers?

    "full_content": "Title:Celebrating the Prophet Muhammad’s Birthday (Maulid) Is Paganism and Not Mentioned in the Qur’anBy Dr. Maxwell Shimba – Shimba Theological InstitutePublished: Saturday, August 15, 2015Introductory Questions to Muslims:Which verse in the Qur’an commands Muslims to celebrate the Prophet Muhammad’s birthday (Maulid)?Whom do Muslims truly follow—Allah, Muhammad, the Qur’an, the Sahih Hadith, the Five Pillars, or Sharia?IntroductionThe pagan nature of Maulid (the celebration of the Prophet Muhammad’s birthday) can be understood by examining three major areas:The history of Maulid.The lack of any specific birth date for Prophet Muhammad in the Qur’an or authentic Hadith.Scholarly consensus on the pagan origins of Maulid.(a) The History of MaulidThis history reveals three key facts:Neither Prophet Muhammad nor his companions celebrated Maulid.The celebration of Maulid began over 300 years after the Prophet’s death.The originators of Maulid are linked to heretical or pagan sects.Anyone who examines the life of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and the history of his Companions, their successors (Tabi’in), and those who followed them faithfully up to the year 350 Hijri will not find any record of scholars, rulers, or common people celebrating Maulid. As noted by Al-Hafidh As-Sakhawi:“The practice of celebrating the Prophet’s birthday was not carried out by the righteous predecessors of the first three generations. Indeed, it was introduced much later.”(Subulul Hudaa war Rashaad by As-Salihiy, Vol. 1, p. 439).So, when did Maulid start?According to Sunni scholar Al-Imam Al-Maqrizi:“During the rule of the Fatimids—who were Shi’a Isma’ilis—in Egypt, Maulid was instituted as part of numerous annual festivals. They introduced celebrations for the Prophet, Ali, Fatimah, Hasan, Husayn, and their living Imam.”(Al-Khutwat, Vol. 1, p. 490)In another work, Al-Maqrizi writes:“During the month of Rabi’ al-Awwal, people were compelled to light candles in streets and alleys in Egypt as part of Maulid celebrations.”These practices began with the Fatimid rulers, particularly the Banu ‘Ubayd dynasty, falsely claiming descent from Fatimah. Scholars such as Shaykh Muhammad Bakhit al-Muti’i, Shaykh ‘Ali Mahfudh, and Shaykh Isma’il al-Ansari confirm this innovation in their works. According to ‘Ali Mahfudh:“The first people to introduce the Prophet’s Maulid in Cairo were the Fatimid Shi’a rulers in the 4th century Hijri. They celebrated six Maulids: those of the Prophet, Ali, Fatimah, Hasan, Husayn, and the ruling Imam.”(Al-Ibda’ Fii Madh-har al-Ibtidaa‘, p. 251)Scholarly Opinions on the Fatimid DynastyImam Shaamah, a historian and hadith scholar, describes the Fatimids as:Claiming false descent from Fatimah to justify their rule.Their founder, ‘Ubaydullah, is described as a Magian (Zoroastrian), a heretic, or even a Jew by descent.The dynasty promoted innovations and suppressed Sunni scholars.They manipulated religion for power and propagated extreme Shia ideology.The dynasty ruled from 299 to 567 Hijri and created fertile ground for the rise of heretical sects like the Druze, Hashashiyyun (Assassins), and others. The Crusaders exploited this religious disunity until Salahuddin al-Ayyubi restored Sunni orthodoxy and liberated the lands.Quotations from Muslim Scholars on the FatimidsAccording to Imam Shaamah:“They were apostates disguised as nobles. Their lineage was fabricated. They killed scholars, allied with Crusaders, and desecrated religious teachings.”(Ar-Rawdhatayn Fiy Akhbaar Dawlatayn, pp. 200–202)The so-called Mahdi of the dynasty is described as:A blasphemer who insulted the Prophet’s wives publicly.Claimed by his followers to be either the Mahdi, a prophet, or even Allah Himself.Shaykh Abdullah Saleh Farsy confirms:“The celebration of Maulid originated with the Shi’a Isma’ilis, who ruled Sunni lands from 297 to 567 Hijri. After their fall, the Sunnis adopted the Maulid of the Prophet and abandoned the others.”(Tafsiri ya Mawlid Barzanji, Zanzibar, p. iv)The first recorded Sunni celebration of Maulid occurred under King Muzaffar al-Din in Iraq in the 6th century Hijri, over 600 years after the Prophet’s birth.(b) No Authentic Qur'anic or Hadith Evidence for the Prophet’s Birth DateThe exact date of the Prophet’s birth is unknown. It is neither mentioned in the Qur’an nor in any authentic Hadith. Scholars differ widely on the year and date.Safi-ur-Rahman Mubarakpuri writes:“Muhammad (peace be upon him) was born on a Monday, 9th Rabi’ al-Awwal, Year of the Elephant (571 CE).”(Ar-Rahiq Al-Makhtum, p. 62)Sirajur Rahman notes:“The event of the Elephant occurred 55 days before the Prophet’s birth, in Muharram. This corresponds to late February or early March 571 CE.”(Al-Mustafa, 1993, p. 11)Thus, even scholars can only speculate the Prophet was born sometime between 25th Safar and 25th Rabi’ al-Awwal.(c) Scholarly Evidence Declaring Maulid as Pagan InnovationSeveral scholars have denounced Maulid as aBid’ah(innovation):Imam Al-ShatibiinAl-I’tisam (1/34)listed Maulid as one of the religious innovations that must be rejected.Imam Al-Fakihaniwrote a full treatise condemning Maulid.Imam Al-Haj Al-Malikicalled Maulid a bid’ah inAl-Mudkhal (2/11–12).Abu At-Tayyib Shams al-Haq Al-Azimabadiand his teacherBashir al-Din Qanujicondemned it inGhayat al-Kalam fi Ibtal Amal al-Mawlid wal-Qiyam.Abu ‘Abdullah Al-Haffar Al-Malikifrom Morocco stated:“No generation of pious Muslims ever celebrated the Prophet’s birthday, including the Companions. They never distinguished that night for any specific activity.”Final Questions for Reflection:Where in the Qur’an does it command Muslims to celebrate the Prophet Muhammad’s birthday?Where in the Qur’an is the date of Muhammad’s birth or life explicitly mentioned?Why do Muslims celebrate something the Qur’an is silent about?Whom do Muslims truly follow—Allah, Muhammad, the Qur’an, Sahih Hadith, the Five Pillars, or the Sharia?Conclusion:The celebration of the Prophet Muhammad’s birthday (Maulid) isnot Islamic but pagan in origin. It isnot found in the Qur’an,was never practiced by the Prophet or his Companions, andwas introduced centuries later by a heretical sect. True devotion to the Prophet is not throughunauthorized innovationsbut throughadherence to the Qur’an and authentic Sunnah.Max Shimba MinistriesDr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological Institute",

Does this attribute of Al-Malik al-Mulk also apply to the living Jesus?Let us begin our research by reading the Quran and seeing for ourselves whether Jesus is truly God or not. One of the attributes or majesty of God according to the Quran is: Al-Malik al-Mulk, meaning THE OWNER OF EVERYTHING. This attribute of Al-Malik al-Mulk is one of the 99 names of Allah in the Quran.Does Jesus have this attribute of OWNER OF ALL \"Al-Malik al-Mulk\"? Let us first read the Quran and see if Allah has this attribute of Al-Malik al-Mulk.Surah YA-SIN 83:\"So exalted is He in whose hand is the realm of all things; and to Him you will be returned.\"Allah says that He is the Owner of everything in the Quran, which was written 632 years after Jesus. Does Jesus have this attribute of Owner of all things?JESUS SAYS THIS:Matthew 11:27 “All things have been committed to me by my Father; no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.”This means that Jesus was the first to confess these words, that He is the owner of all things, according to the testimony of the Bible, which preceded the Quran by 632 years. JESUS SAYS THAT \"ALL THINGS HAVE BEEN COMMITTED TO ME.\" This means that even Muhammad is now under Jesus.JESUS CONTINUES TO SAYin John 16:15,“All that belongs to the Father is mine. That is why I said the Spirit will receive from me what he will make known to you.”Jesus says that everything that belongs to His Father is His. At this point, the matter is settled, as no one can dispute this clear and complete verse. JESUS IS THE OWNER OF EVERYTHING.So, between Jesus, who spoke these words 632 years before Allah, and Allah, who came later with the Quran full of doubts, whom shall we believe? The first, who is Jesus, or Allah, who is just copying from Jesus?Dear friends, this is sufficient evidence that Jesus is God, for today we have learned that Jesus said and is called the OWNER OF ALL THINGS 632 years before the writing of the Quran.Now, between the Bible, which came before the Quran, and the Quran, which came after the Bible, which book will you follow? Researchers in various fields use original data to verify and confirm a matter. And the data we have about the OWNER of all things, which is the earliest, is in the Bible and says that the OWNER OF ALL THINGS IS JESUS.Today, I have answered the question of Muslims: Is Jesus God? The Quran, together with Allah, says that Jesus is God because Jesus has all the majesty and/or attributes of God, and one of those attributes is AL-MALIK AL-MULK.In His service,Dr. Maxwell ShimbaCopyright © Max Shimba Ministries 2015",

    "full_content": "Contradictions within the Qur'an: Do Qur'anic Verses Contradict Each Other?Maxwell Shimba Ministries OrgMonday, August 3, 2015IntroductionThe Qur'an, revered by Muslims as the literal word of God (Allah), claims consistency and perfection in its message. However, a careful comparative reading of its various surahs (chapters) reveals statements that appear contradictory, particularly concerning how Muslims are instructed to treat non-Muslims, especially the \"People of the Book\" (Christians and Jews). This article seeks to examine a series of Qur'anic verses and analyze the apparent inconsistencies in their directives, questioning the reliability of the text as a divine revelation.Textual AnalysisInSurah Al-Baqara (2:109), the Qur'an states:\"Many of the People of the Book wish, through envy, to lead you back to unbelief, now that you have embraced the faith and the truth has been made plain to them. Forgive them and bear with them until Allah makes known His will. He has power over all things.\"(Qur'an 2:109, Abdel Haleem Translation)This verse addresses Christians and Jews, referred to as \"People of the Book,\" suggesting that some of them envy Muslims and wish to turn them away from Islam. However, it counsels Muslims to forgive and be patient with them until Allah reveals His final judgment.Similarly, inSurah Al-Imran (3:20):\"If they turn away, your duty is only to convey the message.\"(Qur'an 3:20, Yusuf Ali Translation)This verse instructs Muslims to merely warn non-believers, indicating that it is not the responsibility of Muslims to force others into belief.From these two verses, one can deduce:It is the duty of Muslims to preach their religion but not to compel people to believe.Allah, in His own time, will reveal His will to those who disbelieve.Muslims are only responsible for conveying warnings to non-believers.However, other Qur'anic verses present a starkly different message:InSurah An-Nisa (4:101):\"The disbelievers are your sworn enemies.\"(Qur'an 4:101, Pickthall Translation)InSurah At-Tawba (9:3):\"Announce to those who disbelieve a painful punishment.\"(Qur'an 9:3, Sahih International Translation)InSurah Al-Anfal (8:39):\"Fight them until there is no [more] persecution, and religion is for Allah [alone].\"(Qur'an 8:39, Sahih International Translation)These verses appear to transition from patient tolerance to active hostility, including the declaration of enmity, threats of severe punishment, and commands for armed conflict until Islam reigns supreme.Critical QuestionsThis textual divergence raises several crucial theological and logical questions:Was it the same entity who gave Muhammad the words in 2:109, 3:20, and those in 4:101, 9:3, and 8:39 — or were there multiple sources?Why would one verse command tolerance and mere warning, while another instructs hostility and warfare?Is this not indicative of forgetfulness — a human trait — which should not be attributed to an omniscient and omnipotent God?If it is indeed the same deity, are these verses compatible or contradictory?If they are compatible, how can such opposing commands be reconciled logically and theologically?If they contradict one another, does this not serve as evidence that the Qur'an is not from the true God, especially since the Qur'an itself establishes consistency as a criterion for divine authenticity?(cf. Qur'an 4:82: \"Do they not then consider the Qur'an carefully? Had it been from other than Allah, they would surely have found therein much contradiction.\")An infallible God cannot issue conflicting instructions, forget His prior declarations, or contradict Himself. Contradictions are a characteristic of human imperfection, not divine revelation.ConclusionThese apparent contradictions within the Qur'an pose a significant theological problem. The God of the Bible, by contrast, is consistent in character and purpose. He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, into the world to offer redemption for humanity’s sins, not through coercion but through love, grace, and truth.Therefore, I warmly invite Muslims to turn to the God of the Bible, who alone offers eternal salvation through Jesus Christ.May God bless you abundantly.ReferencesAbdel Haleem, M.

An Analytical Examination of Islamic TextsAuthor: Dr. Maxwell ShimbaPublished by: Max Shimba Ministries Org.Date: August 3, 2015IntroductionThis paper explores a provocative theological inquiry: Does Allah, as depicted in Islamic scripture and tradition, possess hands and eyes similar to those of created beings? By examining select Qur'anic verses and Hadith narrations, and juxtaposing them with Islamic theological positions, this study seeks to critically analyze whether the anthropomorphic descriptions in Islamic texts imply a corporeal deity.Qur'anic Passages Referencing the Hands of AllahOne of the primary passages frequently cited is:Az-Zumar (39:67):\"They did not appraise Allah with true appraisal, while the earth entirely will be within His grip on the Day of Resurrection, and the heavens will be folded in His right hand. Exalted is He and high above what they associate with Him.\"Additionally,Al-Ma'idah (5:64)states:\"The Jews say, 'Allah's hand is chained.' Chained are their hands, and cursed are they for what they say. Rather, both His hands are extended; He spends however He wills.\"Other relevant verses include:Yasin (36:83):\"So exalted is He in whose hand is the realm of all things, and to Him you will be returned.\"Ali 'Imran (3:26):\"Say, 'O Allah, Owner of Sovereignty, You give sovereignty to whom You will and You take sovereignty away from whom You will. You honor whom You will and You humble whom You will. In Your hand is [all] good. Indeed, You are over all things competent.'\"Sad (38:75):\"[Allah] said, 'O Iblis, what prevented you from prostrating to that which I created with My hands? Are you arrogant, or are you among the exalted?'\"Hadith EvidenceAccording to narrations in Sunni compilations, Abu Huraira reported that the Prophet Muhammad said:\"Allah created Adam with His own hands and wrote the Torah for Moses with His own hands.\"Another hadith states:\"Allah descends to the nearest heaven and stretches out His two hands, saying…\"Theological CommentaryIslamic theologians from various schools—Ash'ari, Maturidi, Hanbali, and others—have engaged extensively with these anthropomorphic expressions. The traditional Sunni creed acknowledges Allah’s 'hands' and 'face' as mentioned in the Qur’an and Sunnah but asserts that these attributes are unique to Allah and bear no resemblance to human characteristics.A popular theological analogy explains: A table and a person both have 'legs,' but the nature of these legs differs. Similarly, Allah's 'hands' are befitting His majesty and beyond human comprehension.Additional Qur'anic Descriptions: Eyes of AllahThe Qur'an also references Allah's 'eyes':Hud (11:37):\"And construct the ship under Our eyes and Our revelation…\"Another hadith states:\"The Dajjal is one-eyed, and your Lord is not one-eyed.\"These descriptions, like those of Allah's 'hands,' are interpreted by theologians within the framework ofbilā kayf(without asking how) andtanzīh(declaring Allah's incomparability).Do These Attributes Imply Corporeality?Max Shimba Ministries contends that anthropomorphic language, if taken literally, challenges Islamic claims of Allah's absolute transcendence. If Allah possesses 'hands' and 'eyes' in any form comparable to creation, this could imply corporeality.ConclusionThis analysis reveals significant anthropomorphic language within the Qur’an and Hadith. Traditional Islamic theology resolves this tension through principles oftanzīhandbilā kayf, affirming the attributes without likening them to human attributes. However, literalist interpretations risk portraying Allah as a corporeal being, conflicting with Islamic assertions of divine incomparability.ReferencesThe Qur'an: Az-Zumar (39:67), Al-Ma'idah (5:64), Yasin (36:83), Ali 'Imran (3:26), Sad (38:75), Hud (11:37)Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim compilations of hadith via Abu HurairaAl-Ash'ari,Kitab al-Luma'(The Book of Flashes)Ibn Taymiyyah,Majmu' al-FatawaAl-Ghazali,Ihya Ulum al-DinAbout the AuthorDr. Maxwell Shimba is the founder of Max Shimba Ministries Org., a theologian and religious commentator focusing on comparative religion, biblical theology, and critical Islamic studies.© 2015 Max Shimba Ministries Org.

The Allah of Islam, who has claimed in various Qur'anic verses that He has no likeness and cannot be compared to anything in existence, surprisingly contradicts Himself in certain hadith literature by implying that He wears garments, possesses physical attributes such as hands, eyes, and ears — essentially, attributes analogous to His creation.In this paper, we shall examine this issue critically, drawing upon authoritative Islamic sources to demonstrate how such descriptions contradict the fundamental Islamic claim of Allah’s absolute incomparability (tanzīh) and transcendence.Textual Evidence from Islamic SourcesLet us proceed directly to the evidences drawn from the hadith collections revered in Islam:1. Allah Wears ClothesIn an authentic Hadith Qudsi, Allah is quoted as saying:\"Al-Kibriyā’ ridā’ī, wa al-‘aẓamah izārī.\"\"Pride is My upper garment and greatness is My lower garment.\"1This statement presents a profound theological problem. If Allah is said to wear an upper and lower garment — metaphorically or literally — it implies a physical form upon which these garments rest. This raises critical philosophical and theological concerns about the supposed incorporeal nature of Allah. If Allah has garments, does He then have a body to adorn them? And if He has a body, is He not then comparable to created beings, contradicting His own claim in the Qur'an:لَيْسَ كَمِثْلِهِ شَيْءٌ\"There is nothing like unto Him.\"(Qur'an 42:11)Thus, the claim of Allah’s transcendence is undermined by this hadith.2. Allah Has Eyes, Hands, Ears, and FeetIn another well-known Hadith Qudsi recorded in Sahih al-Bukhari, Allah says:“…And My servant does not draw near to Me with anything more beloved to Me than the religious duties I have obligated upon him; and My servant continues to draw near to Me with supererogatory works so that I shall love him. And when I love him, I become his hearing with which he hears, his sight with which he sees, his hand with which he strikes, and his foot with which he walks.”2In this passage, Allah claims to possess ears, eyes, hands, and feet, once again implying anthropomorphic attributes. While Islamic scholars have classically attempted to interpret such narrations metaphorically (ta’wīl) or consign their meaning to Allah (tafwīḍ), the explicit wording of these narrations leaves significant ambiguity.If one upholds the literal reading, as many traditionalists (Ahl al-Hadith) have, it would imply that Allah possesses bodily attributes akin to His creation, directly violating the Qur'anic proclamation of uniqueness and incomparability.The Theological DilemmaDear readers, it is now evident that according to Islamic hadith literature, Allah is described in terms familiar to human beings — wearing garments, possessing sensory organs, and bodily limbs. This undermines the claim that Allah is utterly unlike His creation and exposes a serious doctrinal contradiction within Islamic theology.If Allah is attributed with garments and physical traits, how then can He be fundamentally different from created beings? This conundrum raises difficult questions for the doctrine of divine transcendence in Islam and warrants deeper examination.ConclusionThis analysis reveals profound inconsistencies within Islamic theology regarding the nature of Allah. While the Qur'an categorically denies that anything resembles Allah, several authentic hadith narrations attribute to Him anthropomorphic characteristics. These contradictions cannot be dismissed lightly, as they touch upon the very essence of divinity and the nature of God as understood within Islam.ReferencesBibliographyAl-Bukhari, Muhammad ibn Ismail.Sahih al-Bukhari.

The study draws from canonical Christian Scriptures and Islamic primary sources—the Qur’an and Hadith literature—to demonstrate the fundamental doctrinal differences in eschatological beliefs concerning the afterlife in Christianity and Islam.Introduction:The nature of the afterlife has long been a central theme in both Christian and Islamic theology. While both faiths affirm the existence of an afterlife, their descriptions of its nature, rewards, and experiences differ considerably. This paper examines the biblical vision of heaven and contrasts it with the Qur’anic and Hadith descriptions of paradise, raising critical theological reflections.1. The Christian Concept of Heaven:According to Luke 20:34–36 (New International Version):\"Jesus replied, 'The people of this age marry and are given in marriage. But those who are considered worthy of taking part in the age to come and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage, and they can no longer die; for they are like the angels. They are God’s children, since they are children of the resurrection.'\"This passage confirms that in the Christian heaven, there is no marriage, for the redeemed will possess spiritual bodies (1 Corinthians 15:43–54). Additionally, Romans 14:17 affirms:\"For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.\"Further, Revelation 7:16–17 states:\"Never again will they hunger; never again will they thirst. The sun will not beat down on them, nor any scorching heat. For the Lamb at the center of the throne will be their shepherd; ‘he will lead them to springs of living water.’ ‘And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.’\"This biblical portrayal focuses on spiritual fulfillment, communion with God, and eternal peace without physical indulgences.2. The Islamic Concept of Paradise (Jannah):In contrast, the Islamic depiction of paradise includes tangible and sensual rewards:i)Palatial Mansions:Qur’an 39:20 (Surat Az-Zumar):\"But those who feared their Lord will have lofty dwellings, one above another, beneath which rivers flow. [That is] the promise of Allah. Never does Allah fail in His promise.\"ii)Rivers of various drinks and fruits:Qur’an 47:15 (Surat Muhammad):\"A description of the Paradise which the righteous are promised: In it are rivers of unpolluted water, rivers of milk the taste of which never changes, rivers of wine delicious to those who drink, and rivers of purified honey, in which they will have all kinds of fruits, and forgiveness from their Lord.\"Qur’an 2:25 (Surat Al-Baqarah):\"And give good tidings to those who believe and do righteous deeds that they will have gardens [in Paradise] beneath which rivers flow. Whenever they are provided with a provision of fruit therefrom, they will say, ‘This is what we were provided with before.’ And it is given to them in likeness. And they will have therein purified spouses, and they will abide therein eternally.\"iii)Provision of Women and Sexual Rewards:Qur’an 56:21–23 (Surat Al-Waqi‘ah):\"And the flesh of fowls, any that they may desire. And [there will be] fair ones with wide, lovely eyes, like unto hidden pearls.\"Qur’an 37:48–49 (Surat As-Saffat):\"And with them will be women limiting [their] glances, with large, [beautiful] eyes, as if they were [delicate] eggs, well protected.\"Qur’an 37:44–46:\"They will be on thrones facing each other. There will be circulated among them a cup [of wine] from a flowing spring, white and delicious to the drinkers.\"iv)Hadith Description of Sexual Rewards:Hadith literature further elaborates on these sensual aspects. In Sunan Ibn Majah, Vol. 5, Hadith No. 4337:\"It was narrated from Abu Umamah that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: 'Allah will not admit anyone into Paradise except Allah, the Mighty and Glorious, will marry him to seventy-two wives, two from the women of Paradise (Hur al-‘Ayn) and seventy from his inheritance of the people of Hell. Every one of them will have a pleasant vagina, and the male’s sexual organ will never become flaccid.'\"3. Critical Reflection:From a Christian theological perspective, such physical and sensual indulgences in the afterlife appear incongruent with the biblical portrayal of heaven. Christianity teaches that worldly pleasures such as alcohol, sexual relations, and material opulence belong to earthly life, while the eternal kingdom of God transcends physical needs and is characterized by righteousness, peace, and the beatific vision of God.Conclusion:The comparison above highlights substantial theological divergences between Christian and Islamic eschatologies. While Christianity envisages heaven as a realm of spiritual glorification, eternal communion with God, and freedom from earthly desires, Islam offers a paradise of physical pleasures and sensual rewards. This raises important questions about the theological nature of each religion’s ultimate hope and conception of divine-human fellowship in eternity.References:The Holy Bible, New International Version (NIV)The Holy Qur’an, translations by Abdullah Yusuf Ali and Saheeh InternationalSunan Ibn Majah, Vol. 5, Hadith No. 4337Bibliography:Ali, Abdullah Yusuf.The Meaning of the Holy Qur'an.

It critiques the Islamic concept of resurrection, particularly the idea ofAjab al-Dhanab(a supposed indestructible part of the human body), and juxtaposes it with the biblically founded Christian doctrine of bodily resurrection as affirmed through Jesus Christ. Scriptural references from both the Qur’an and the Bible are critically examined in light of doctrinal coherence, theological consistency, and eschatological hope.1. IntroductionThe doctrine of resurrection is fundamental in both Islamic and Christian eschatology. However, the nature, mechanics, and theological implications of resurrection differ significantly between these two Abrahamic faiths. This article investigates the Islamic notion that human resurrection on the Day of Judgment involves theAjab al-Dhanab— a minute, indestructible part of the human body — and challenges its coherence when compared to the Christian understanding of resurrection through Jesus Christ.2. Islamic Concept of Resurrection and theAjab al-DhanabDoctrine2.1 The Three Components of Human Beings in DeathIslamic theology posits that upon death, the three fundamental components of human beings return to their origin:Thebody(composed of dust) returns to the earth.Thesoulis taken to a metaphysical state known asBarzakh.A minute, indestructible seed calledAjab al-Dhanabremains intact in the earth.According toSurah Qaf 50:4, Allah states:\"We know what the earth diminishes of them, and with Us is a retaining Book.\"This verse is interpreted by Muslim scholars to suggest that part of the body is preserved for future resurrection.2.2Ajab al-Dhanab: The Seed of ResurrectionAjab al-Dhanab, said to originate from Adam’s spine, is described as a tiny, indestructible element of the human being that survives decomposition. Islamic hadith literature (Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawud, An-Nasa’i, Malik’s Muwatta) records Prophet Muhammad asserting:“Every part of the son of Adam decays exceptAjab al-Dhanab, and from it he will be resurrected.”The claim continues that on the Day of Judgment, Allah will send down rain that causes this part to sprout like a seed, regenerating the human body.2.3 Qur’anic Analogies of Botanical ResurrectionThe Qur’an compares resurrection to the sprouting of plants after rainfall:“And He brings the living out of the dead, and brings the dead out of the living, and revives the earth after its death, and likewise will you be brought out.”—(Surah Ar-Rum 30:19)Muhammad is reported to have illustrated this by asking a companion whether he had seen a barren land bloom after rainfall — likening that renewal to bodily resurrection.3. Critical Evaluation of the Islamic DoctrineThe Islamic resurrection model presents conceptual difficulties. The assertion that human beings originate fromAjab al-Dhanab, and not solely from dust as traditionally believed, introduces a theological inconsistency. If human beings are created from dust (as stated elsewhere in the Qur’an), how then can resurrection depend on a microscopic indestructible component?Further, the argument that this seed remains physically intact after death — observable only with a powerful microscope — raises scientific and philosophical concerns about the feasibility and universality of such a claim.The analogy with plant biology, though poetic, oversimplifies the complexity of human anatomy and divine action. Resurrection is thereby reduced to a mechanistic biological process, lacking the spiritual depth and divine sovereignty emphasized in biblical theology.4. Christian Doctrine of Resurrection: A Christocentric Hope4.1 Foundational Teachings on ResurrectionResurrection is a foundational doctrine in Christianity, as outlined inHebrews 6:1–2. Jesus Christ’s resurrection is the archetype and guarantee of the resurrection of all the dead:“But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.”—(1 Corinthians 15:20–23)Christ’s resurrection was foretold by Himself (Matthew 16:21; 17:22–23; Luke 18:31–34), and fulfilled as recorded in the Gospels. The reality of His resurrection affirms the hope of believers.4.2 Biblical Passages Supporting the Resurrection of the DeadLuke 14:13–14: “You will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.”John 5:28–29: “All who are in the graves will hear His voice and come forth.”1 Thessalonians 4:16: “The dead in Christ will rise first.”These scriptures place the authority of resurrection not on a biological remnant (Ajab al-Dhanab), but on the sovereign power of God through Christ.4.3 Rebutting Historical ObjectionsWhen the resurrection of Christ was denied, the Gospel accounts provide not only historical claims but counter the false narratives, such as:The bribery of Roman soldiers to lie about Jesus' body being stolen (Matthew 28:11–15).The logical contradiction: If soldiers were asleep, how could they identify the perpetrators?Despite skepticism, the resurrection of Christ remains the cornerstone of Christian faith and the assurance of future bodily resurrection.5. Conclusion: Theological and Logical Consistency in the Doctrine of ResurrectionThe Islamic view of resurrection viaAjab al-Dhanabis fraught with theological and logical inconsistencies. It conflates physical determinism with spiritual rebirth and depends heavily on metaphor without adequate scriptural or scientific support.Conversely, the Christian doctrine of resurrection, rooted in the person and work of Jesus Christ, offers a coherent and hopeful eschatology. It affirms the power of God, the promise of eternal life, and the future bodily resurrection of all believers — not on account of a microscopic remnant, but by the victory of Christ over death.“If we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with Him those who sleep in Jesus.”—(1 Thessalonians 4:14)ReferencesThe Holy Bible (ESV, NIV, KJV)The Qur’an (Transl.

Using scriptural references, it warns against substituting the Creator with created objects in worship and calls for repentance and exclusive devotion to the God of the Bible, the Father of Jesus Christ.1.Biblical Foundation Against IdolatryThe foundation of the article is rooted inExodus 20:1–6, where God commands the Israelites to worship no other gods and forbids the making or veneration of any graven images:“I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. You shall have no other gods before me. You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below. You shall not bow down to them or worship them…”(Exodus 20:1–6, NIV)This passage forms the core of the argument: any act of bowing to, revering, or serving created objects—whether celestial bodies like themoon,stars, andsun, or man-made images—is a violation of God's commandments.2.Condemnation of Celestial WorshipThe article asserts that certain religious practices today, including those within Islam, involve acts that the Bible equates to idolatry. It highlights:Reverence for the moon and stars, often symbolically or ritually expressed.The belief that honoring celestial elements in worship contradicts biblical theology, whereonly the Creatoris worthy of worship.The article stresses that although God created these celestial bodies, worshiping them—or involving them in religious practice—constitutes abetrayal of divine authorityand aligns the worshipper with false deities.3.Historical Context: The Golden CalfThe narrative of thegolden calfinExodus 32is cited as a historical example of human inclination toward idolatry. While Moses was on Mount Sinai, the Israelites, under Aaron's leadership, constructed a golden calf and worshiped it, inciting God's anger.This, according to the article, parallels modern practices where people:Construct or honorimages, statues, and symbols,Assign spiritual or ritualistic significance to created objects,Misrepresent such practices as legitimate forms of honoring God.4.Theological Implication and Divine JealousyThe article underscores God’s declaration of being ajealous Godwho punishes those who hate Him to the third and fourth generation, but shows mercy to those who love Him and keep His commandments. This is reiterated to stress theseriousness of spiritual fidelity.5.New Testament Affirmation: Salvation in Christ AloneThe conclusion turns toNew Testament theology, specificallyRomans 10:9, affirming that:“If you declare with your mouth, ‘Jesus is Lord,’ and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.”Thus, salvation and entry into heaven require:Acknowledgment ofJesus Christas Lord and Savior,Baptism by immersion(symbolized by flowing water, e.g., the Jordan River),Alife of holiness and obedienceto God's Word.6.A Call to RepentanceThe article closes with aprayer of repentance, inviting the reader to forsake idolatrous practices and submit fully to Jesus Christ. This is presented as the only path to eternal life and reconciliation with God.7.ConclusionThe core message is thatworshiping celestial bodies, images, or any created object is incompatible with biblical worship. True worship is directed exclusively toYahweh, the God of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and the Father of Jesus Christ. The article issues a warning that those who persist in such practices risk eternal separation from God.Recommended Citation:Shimba, Max.\"Muslims Worship Celestial Bodies and Idols: A Biblical Critique.\"Max Shimba Ministries Org, July 21, 2015.",

A Theological Reflection on the Islamic Ritual of Stoning the DevilBy Max Shimba Ministries Org.Originally Published: July 15, 2015AbstractThis article examines the Islamic ritual of stoning the devil during the Hajj pilgrimage and critically evaluates its theological implications. The piece questions the rationale behind this practice and contrasts it with biblical revelation. It seeks to provoke reflection on whether such a ritual is consistent with a monotheistic belief in an all-powerful God.IntroductionDear brothers and sisters, this article brings to light a controversial aspect of the Islamic pilgrimage (Hajj). As unbelievable as it may sound, during the Hajj, Muslims participate in a ritual act of throwing stones at structures symbolizing Satan. This act occurs in Mina, near Mecca, and follows what is believed to be a prophetic tradition (Sunnah). But what does this signify theologically? Does Satan physically reside in Mecca? What are the origins of this ritual? These are the critical questions this article explores.The Ritual of Stoning in HajjOn the 10th day of Dhu al-Hijjah, pilgrims depart from Muzdalifah and collect stones along the way. Islamic tradition prescribes that on this first day, only seven stones are to be thrown, in accordance with prophetic practice.According to a Hadith:“The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) delayed stoning until after the sun had risen…”(Reported by At-Tirmidhi)Those with valid excuses may delay stoning until sunset, although it is preferable to perform the act between noon (Zawal) and sunset.At Mina, the ritual of stoning the devil begins. Pilgrims throw seven stones at a pillar known asJamrat al-Aqabah, which symbolizes Satan. This practice is repeated during the nights of the 11th, 12th, and for some, the 13th of Dhu al-Hijjah.Critical ObservationsThe question arises: does Satan have a physical body that can be harmed by stones? Is Allah incapable of defeating Satan without the help of humans pelting him with stones?The fact that Muslims throw stones at a fixed structure year after year suggests a ritualistic personification of Satan. If Satan is indeed a spiritual being, how effective can physical stones be? This ritual appears more symbolic than efficacious, yet it holds a central place in Hajj.Moreover, the ritual is performed at night for three consecutive days—another element that raises questions about its purpose and meaning.Du'a After StoningAfter stoning each of the first two pillars (Jamaraat), pilgrims are encouraged to face the Qiblah and offer supplications (du‘a). However, after stoning the third (largest) pillar, no such prayer is prescribed.“The Prophet (peace be upon him) used to pray after throwing each Jamaraat, except after the last one.”(Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Imam Ahmad)This structure raises theological concerns: why omit prayer after the final act of stoning? What differentiates the last pillar from the rest?Departure from Mina: The Hastening Day (Yawm al-Isti’jaal)Pilgrims who choose to stay only two days in Mina may leave on the 12th of Dhu al-Hijjah before sunset. However, if they remain past sunset, they are obliged to stay a third day. For those with no pressing responsibilities, remaining for the third night is encouraged.The Farewell Circumambulation (Tawaf al-Wida’)Before departing Mecca, pilgrims must perform a farewell circumambulation (Tawaf al-Wida’). This involves circling the Ka‘bah seven times without performing Sa‘i (the walk between Safa and Marwah), which was done earlier in the pilgrimage.Theological ReflectionThere is no mention in the Torah, the Psalms, or the Gospels (Injil) where God commands His people to stone Satan. This ritual is found exclusively in Islamic tradition and lacks biblical precedent. It contradicts the nature of God as revealed in the Bible—an omnipotent Being who needs no human assistance to defeat the devil.Is it reasonable for a person to collect stones and throw them at a symbolic representation of Satan? Does this ritual have divine efficacy? Is it not an act based more on folklore than revealed scripture?Conclusion and AppealThe practice of stoning the devil in Mina suggests a ritualistic tradition devoid of biblical foundation. It also hints at a deeper theological confusion—depicting Satan as having a location and a tangible presence subject to physical attack.We encourage all Christians around the world to pray for our Muslim brothers and sisters. Many travel across continents to participate in a ritual of stoning Satan, unaware that true victory over evil comes only through Jesus Christ.Challenging Questions for MuslimsWhat spiritual benefit is derived from stoning Satan?Where in the Abrahamic scriptures is Abraham shown stoning Satan?Why is this ritual exclusive to Islamic sources and absent from the Torah, Psalms, and Gospels?We invite you to consider the person and power ofJesus Christ, the true conqueror of Satan.“Then the God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet.”(Romans 16:20)Max Shimba Ministries Org.July 2015",

The analysis will compare these findings with the Christian concept of the sinlessness of Christ, raising theological and ethical questions about the implications for soteriology in Islam and Christianity.1. Muhammad’s Participation in Raids and the Acquisition of Spoils1.1 Historical ContextEarly Islamic history documents several military raids (ghazawat) led or sanctioned by Muhammad, during which the property of others was seized and captives were taken. According toSahih al-Bukhari, Volume 3, Book 37, Number 495, “When Allah made the Prophet rich through victories, one-fifth of the war booty was placed in the treasury.” Likewise,Sahih Muslim, Volume 2, Book 5, Chapter 401, Number 2348, states that Muhammad’s family shared in the spoils of war.The first recorded act of plundering by Muslims, known as the Nakhla Raid, occurred during the sacred months, a period traditionally respected for the cessation of hostilities. During this raid, Muhammad’s followers attacked a Quraysh caravan, killed a man, and enslaved the survivors, seizing their property (see Watt, 1956,Muhammad at Mecca, p. 136). Muhammad himself later led the significant Battle of Badr, where further spoils were gained (Qur’an 8:1, 8:41).At the conquest of the Jewish settlement of Khaybar, Muhammad and his followers again obtained considerable wealth and took women as captives (Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 5, Book 59, No. 512; Ibn Ishaq,Sirat Rasul Allah, pp. 510–515). Notably, after the siege of Banu Qurayza, between 700–900 men were executed, and women and children were taken as slaves (Ibn Ishaq,Sirat Rasul Allah, pp. 464–466; al-Tabari,History, vol. 8, pp. 35–40).1.2 Moral and Theological AssessmentFrom an ethical standpoint, such actions are considered grave sins by Christian standards, as they involve violence, theft, and the violation of the dignity and rights of others (Exodus 20:13, 15; Matthew 5:44). The New Testament’s Jesus, by contrast, is presented as rejecting violence (Matthew 26:52) and commanding love even for enemies.2. Muhammad’s Admission of Sin and the Command to Seek Forgiveness2.1 Qur’anic DirectivesThe Qur’an explicitly records Allah instructing Muhammad to seek forgiveness for his sins. Surah Ghafir (40:55) states:“So be patient, [O Muhammad]. Indeed, the promise of Allah is truth. And ask forgiveness for your sin and exalt [Allah] with praise of your Lord in the evening and the morning.” (Sahih International translation)Similarly, Surah al-Fath (48:1–2) reads:“Indeed, We have given you, [O Muhammad], a clear conquest. That Allah may forgive for you what preceded of your sin and what will follow and complete His favor upon you and guide you to a straight path.”2.2 Hadith TestimonyTheSahih Muslim, Vol. 1, Book 4, Chapter 268, Number 1695, records Muhammad’s prayer:“I have wronged myself and made repentance for my sins. Forgive my sins...”Other hadiths reinforce this, includingSahih al-BukhariVol. 1, Book 2, Chapter 13, Number 19, and Vol. 8, Book 75, Number 319, where Muhammad repeatedly asks for forgiveness. In several narrations, he admits to seeking forgiveness over seventy times a day (Sahih al-Bukhari Vol. 8, Book 75, Number 319).2.3 Punitive ActionsGrave punishments for criminals are reported in the hadiths, such as amputating hands and feet, gouging out eyes, and denying water until death (Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 8, Book 82, Numbers 794-796; Fiqh us-Sunnah, Vol. 1, p. 133). Such acts, in a Christian moral framework, would be considered inhumane and sinful.3. Theological Implications: The Problem of Sin and Atonement in Islam and ChristianityThe frequent Qur’anic and hadith references to Muhammad’s need for forgiveness and the acts attributed to him contrast sharply with the Christian doctrine of Christ’s sinlessness. In Christian theology, Jesus claims to pay the penalty for humanity’s sins (John 1:29; Romans 5:8; 1 Peter 2:22–24), providing a unique model for redemption.In Islam, no teaching asserts that Muhammad or anyone else pays for the sins of others; rather, forgiveness is based on Allah’s mercy, with no objective atonement (Qur’an 39:53). This raises questions about the justice of God and the means by which sins are actually remitted.4. Contemporary ReflectionsModern events have shown some Muslims justifying acts of violence by citing the Prophet’s actions as precedent, particularly in regions such as Sudan, Nigeria, and Indonesia. Conversely, when Christians perpetrate violence, it is often condemned as contrary to Christ’s teachings. Rarely is similar criticism leveled against Muslims who emulate the Prophet’s example in violence.It is vital for honest interfaith dialogue to confront these realities. Acts of violence, especially against those who worship God, should be unequivocally condemned regardless of the religious identity of the perpetrator. The model set by a religion’s founder profoundly impacts its adherents’ morality and worldview.ConclusionThe evidence from both the Qur’an and hadith literature unmistakably portrays Muhammad as a sinner who repeatedly seeks forgiveness for his transgressions. His participation in violence, acquisition of spoils, and admission of sin set him apart from the Christ of the New Testament, who is depicted as sinless and the redeemer of humanity.The ultimate question for Muslims remains: “Who pays for your sins?” Christianity offers an answer in Christ. Islam, by contrast, leaves the question open, relying on Allah’s discretion rather than atonement.The invitation stands: Come to the living Jesus, the true Savior, who alone offers forgiveness and eternal life.Reflection:Take action.Be saved.Max Shimba Ministries Org.May 26, 2015ReferencesThe Holy Bible, New International VersionThe Qur’an, Sahih International TranslationSahih al-Bukhari, various volumes and hadith numbers as cited aboveSahih Muslim, various volumes and hadith numbers as cited aboveIbn Ishaq,Sirat Rasul AllahAl-Tabari,The History of al-TabariFiqh us-Sunnah, Sayyid Sabiq, Vol. 1Watt, W.

    "full_content": "The Meaning of John 17:3 in Christian Theology: A Response to Muslim Claims Regarding the Divinity of Jesus ChristBy Dr. Maxwell ShimbaShimba Theological InstituteAbstractThis article examines John 17:3—a verse frequently cited by Muslim apologists to argue against the divinity of Jesus Christ. It provides a theological and exegetical analysis of John 17:3–5 within the broader context of the Gospel of John, addresses Islamic objections, and demonstrates that, rather than denying His divinity, Jesus affirms His pre-existence and possession of divine glory, thereby supporting orthodox Christian claims regarding His deity.IntroductionIn contemporary interfaith dialogue, particularly in exchanges between Christian and Muslim apologists, John 17:3 has become a central proof-text for those seeking to deny the divinity of Jesus Christ. Many Islamic preachers and authors contend that, in this passage, Jesus explicitly distinguishes Himself from the “only true God,” thereby allegedly renouncing any claim to deity. This article critically examines such claims and provides a thorough theological interpretation of the passage, emphasizing the necessity of contextual and canonical readings of Scripture.The Contested Passage: John 17:3–5The Gospel of John 17:3–5 reads (NIV):“Now this is eternal life: that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent. I have brought you glory on earth by finishing the work you gave me to do. And now, Father, glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world began.”Muslim critics often isolate verse 3 to argue that Jesus disclaims divinity by distinguishing Himself from “the only true God.” However, a careful examination of verses 4 and 5 reveals a more nuanced and profound Christology.Exegetical and Theological Analysis1. Pre-Existence of ChristIn John 17:5, Jesus prays, “And now, Father, glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world began.” Here, Jesus explicitly claims pre-existence—an attribute unique to God in both biblical and Islamic theology. The assertion that Christ existed “before the world began” directly parallels the prologue of John’s Gospel (“In the beginning was the Word…” John 1:1) and affirms that Jesus possesses an existence that precedes creation itself. Within Christian doctrine, the pre-existence of Christ is foundational to His deity (cf. Philippians 2:5–7; Colossians 1:15–17).Scholarly PerspectiveCraig S. Keener notes that “pre-existence was not attributed to ordinary humans or even prophets; this is an explicitly divine prerogative in Second Temple Judaism.” (Keener,The Gospel of John: A Commentary, 2003).2. The Claim to Divine GloryJesus’ request, “glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world began,” is highly significant. In Isaiah 42:8, God declares, “I will not yield my glory to another.” Thus, for Jesus to claim shared glory with the Father before creation is a declaration of ontological unity with God. No mere human, prophet, or angel can make such a claim without committing blasphemy. Jesus' prayer, therefore, is not a denial but an implicit affirmation of His divine status.Theological InsightF. F. Bruce writes, “The glory which the Son requests to be restored to him is no less than the divine glory which belonged to him in the eternal fellowship of the Godhead.” (Bruce,The Gospel of John, 1983).3. Sinlessness of ChristEven within Islamic tradition, Jesus (‘Isa) is regarded as uniquely sinless among humankind (see Sahih Bukhari 4:55:641; Quran 19:19). If Jesus was merely a man, His request for divine glory would constitute blasphemy—unless He is truly who He claims to be: the eternal Son, worthy of the same honor as the Father (cf. John 5:23).Addressing the Muslim InterpretationMuslim apologists assert that Jesus' words in John 17:3 (“that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent”) represent a categorical denial of divinity. However, this interpretation overlooks several critical hermeneutical and theological points:Contextual Integrity: Verses 4 and 5 provide indispensable context, revealing Jesus’ pre-existence and shared divine glory.Johannine Christology: The entire Gospel of John is replete with statements affirming Christ’s divinity (e.g., John 1:1, 8:58, 10:30).Unity and Distinction: Trinitarian theology posits that the Son is distinct in person from the Father but shares in the same divine essence (homoousios). Thus, Jesus' distinction from the Father in John 17:3 is not a denial of deity but an affirmation of Trinitarian relationality.Implications for Eternal LifeJohn 17:3 states that eternal life consists in knowing the only true God and Jesus Christ. Rather than diminishing Jesus’ status, this places faith in Christ as essential for salvation—an emphasis echoed elsewhere in the New Testament (cf. John 14:6; 1 John 5:20). The unique and inseparable roles of the Father and the Son in granting eternal life further affirm the co-equal divinity of Jesus.ConclusionThe claim that John 17:3 constitutes a denial of Christ’s divinity does not withstand careful exegetical scrutiny. On the contrary, the passage, read in context and in light of biblical theology, affirms Jesus’ pre-existence, participation in divine glory, and essential unity with the Father. Christian doctrine thus finds robust support in these verses, while the common Muslim interpretation rests on an atomistic and contextually flawed reading.BibliographyBruce, F. F.The Gospel of John.

However, in doing so, they contradict the words of Allah as revealed in the Qur’an. Therefore, it is fair to say that they are unbelievers (kafirs).Qur’an 10:47–\"And for every nation there is a messenger. When their messenger comes, judgment is made between them with justice, and they are not wronged.\"Now look at this verse as well:Qur’an 14:4–\"And We did not send any messenger except [speaking] in the language of his people to state clearly for them, and Allah sends astray whom He wills and guides whom He wills. And He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.\"If these verses are true, then Islam is not for nations or communities that are not Arab. The Qur’an states that every people has received a message from God in their own language so they may understand it. The Qur’an was revealed in Arabic so that the Arabs would understand what Allah was saying.This concept of Allah sending down a book in each people's language is crucial and is repeated often. It is foundational to this discussion.Qur’an 16:36–\"And We certainly sent into every nation a messenger, [saying], 'Worship Allah and avoid Taghut (false gods).' And among them were those whom Allah guided, and among them were those upon whom misguidance was [deservedly] decreed. So travel through the earth and observe how was the end of the deniers.\"Qur’an 5:48–\"And We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad], the Book in truth, confirming that which preceded it of the Scripture and as a criterion over it. So judge between them by what Allah has revealed and do not follow their inclinations away from what has come to you of the truth. To each of you We prescribed a law and a method. Had Allah willed, He would have made you one nation [united in religion], but [He intended] to test you in what He has given you; so race to [all that is] good. To Allah is your return all together, and He will [then] inform you concerning that over which you used to differ.\"Qur’an 36:5-6–\"A revelation of the Exalted in Might, the Merciful. That you may warn a people whose forefathers were not warned, so they are unaware.\"These verses are complete and clearly explain that the message came specifically for the Arabs. Allah in the Qur’an says that every people has had their own prophet sent to them to warn them in their own language, and that He sent Muhammad to those who had not yet received guidance and whose ancestors had not been warned—that is, the Arabs. In this way, they would have no excuse to say they never received any message.Continue reading in the Qur’an:Qur’an 6:156–\"Lest you say, 'The Scripture was only sent down to two groups before us, but we were unaware of their teachings.'\"Qur’an 6:157–\"Or lest you say, 'If only the Scripture had been revealed to us, we would have been better guided than they.' So there has [now] come to you a clear evidence from your Lord and a guidance and mercy. Then who is more unjust than one who denies the verses of Allah and turns away from them? We will recompense those who turn away from Our verses with the worst of punishment for their having turned away.\"The Qur’an clearly states that it was revealed to the Arabs. Those who are not Arabs cannot understand the Qur’an—those are Allah's words. Muslims insist that no translation of the Qur’an can be accurate. Therefore, the Qur’an can never be made fully understandable to non-Arab nations or communities and was not sent for them.Another proof that the Qur’an was revealed only for Arabs is found in the following verses:Qur’an 26:198-199–\"And if We had revealed it to one among the non-Arabs, and he had recited it to them, they would still not have believed in it.\"Just as Arabs have the right not to believe in any book that was not revealed in their language—meaning Arabic—non-Arab communities equally have the right not to believe in the Qur’an, a book written in Arabic. That is why the Qur’an says that Allah will send a messenger for every language so that the people can understand him for themselves.To make sure there is no misunderstanding, Allah gives this verse:Qur’an 5:19–\"O People of the Book! Our Messenger has indeed come to you, making things clear to you after an interval without messengers, lest you say, 'There came to us no bringer of good tidings and no warner.' But now there has come to you a bringer of good tidings and a warner. And Allah is Most Capable of all things.\"According to the Qur’an, all people have received revelation. The above verse says the Qur’an was sent to those who had never received revelation before, so they could not say, “We never received a prophet or a warner.”This matter is very clear, but Allah wants it to be clear even to someone with no understanding. That’s why He specifies the actual geographical locations to which Muhammad was sent as a prophet of Allah.Qur’an 6:92–\"And this is a blessed Book which We have revealed, confirming what was before it, that you may warn the Mother of Cities (Mecca) and those around it. Those who believe in the Hereafter believe in it, and they are maintaining their prayers.\"Today, we have learned that the Qur’an was sent only for the Arabs and not for all nations. Now, I’m sure some Muslims will bring other verses that claim Islam is for all mankind. If Muslims do so, then they must acknowledge that those verses contradict the ones above.Therefore, either the Qur’an is a bundle of contradictions and falsehoods, or it is only for the Arabs of Mecca and its surroundings, just as Allah—the god of Muslims—says.In His service,Dr. Maxwell ShimbaCopyright © Max Shimba Ministries 2013",

Hii inafanya iendane na viwango vya uchapishaji wa kisomi.Ukristo ni Bora Kuliko UislamuNa: Dr. Maxwell Shimba1. UtanguliziUkristo na Uislamu mara nyingi hutajwa kama dini mbili kuu za Kimonotheisti (zinazomwamini Mungu mmoja). Hata hivyo, uchambuzi wa kina wa maandiko ya msingi, historia, na theolojia zao unaonyesha tofauti kubwa zinazoweka Ukristo juu kuliko Uislamu. Biblia ni mkusanyiko wa maandiko yaliyohifadhiwa kwa karne nyingi, yaliyoandikwa kati ya karne ya 15 K.K. hadi karne ya kwanza B.K., wakati Qur’an iliibuka karne ya 7 B.K., karne nyingi baadaye.12. Yesu Kristo na Utimilifu wa UnabiiYesu Kristo ndiye kiini cha Ukristo. Alitabiriwa na manabii wa Agano la Kale (Isaya 7:14; Mika 5:2), na maisha yake yameandikwa na mashahidi wa macho katika Injili. Hata wanahistoria wasio Wakristo kamaFlavius Josephus(Antiquities of the Jews, 18.3.3) naTacitus(Annals, 15.44) walithibitisha kuwepo kwa Yesu na kifo chake chini ya Pontio Pilato.2Qur’an yenyewe inakiri kuzaliwa kwa muujiza kwa Yesu (Qur’an 3:45-47).3. Uhakika wa Maandiko ya BibliaBiblia inajulikana kwa uhifadhi wake wa kipekee.Dead Sea Scrolls(karne ya 2 K.K.–1 B.K.) ziligunduliwa mwaka 1947 na kuthibitisha uaminifu wa maandiko ya Agano la Kale yaliyopo sasa.3Biblia yenyewe inashuhudia kudumu kwake:“Majani yakauka, ua likanyauka; bali neno la Mungu wetu litadumu milele”(Isaya 40:8). Qur’an pia inakubali uhalali wa Taurati na Injili (Qur’an 5:46).4. Upendo wa Mungu na Uhakika wa WokovuMsingi wa Ukristo ni upendo wa Mungu:“Kwa maana jinsi hii Mungu aliupenda ulimwengu, hata akamtoa Mwana wake pekee”(Yohana 3:16). Wokovu unatolewa bure kupitia imani (Waefeso 2:8-9). Kwa upande mwingine, Uislamu unaweka msisitizo juu ya matendo na utiifu wa sharia, bila uhakika wa wokovu (Qur’an 45:28).5. Kifo na Ufufuo wa Yesu: Ushahidi KihistoriaUkristo unasimama juu ya kifo na ufufuo wa Yesu. Mtume Paulo anaeleza:“Kristo alikufa kwa ajili ya dhambi zetu… akazikwa, akafufuka siku ya tatu”(1 Wakorintho 15:3-4). Ushahidi wa kaburi tupu na mashahidi wa macho ni wa kihistoria. Hata wanahistoria wa Kiyahudi na Warumi walithibitisha tukio hili.4Qur’an (Sura 4:157) inakataa msalaba, lakini ushahidi wa kihistoria na wa kimaandiko unapingana na madai hayo.6. Mifano ya Kihistoria ya Karne za KatiHistoria inathibitisha tofauti kati ya dini hizi mbili:Katika Ukristo, vyuo vikuu vya kwanza Ulaya (Oxford, Cambridge, Sorbonne) vilianzishwa kutokana na hamu ya kutafuta maarifa ya Mungu.5Wanasayansi kamaGalileo Galilei,Johannes Kepler, naIsaac Newtonwaliongozwa na imani ya Kikristo kwamba ulimwengu una mpangilio wa Kimungu.Katika Uislamu, upanuzi mkubwa ulifanyika kupitiavita vya jihadi. Waarabu walivamia Afrika Kaskazini, Mashariki ya Kati, na Uhispania. Wakristo wa Hispania waliishi chini ya utawala wa Kiislamu hadiReconquista(1492).67. Tofauti ya TheolojiaTofauti ya msingi iko wazi: Mungu wa Biblia ni Mungu wa upendo na wokovu, wakati Qur’an inamchora Allah kama mtawala mkali asiye na uhakika wa kutoa wokovu. Yohane 8:36 inasema:“Basi Mwana atakapowaweka huru, mtakuwa huru kweli kweli.”Qur’an 5:68 inakiri kuwa Wayahudi na Wakristo lazima washikamane na Taurati na Injili, lakini Waislamu wanakana. Hii inaleta kile kinachoitwa “Dilema ya Kiislamu.”78. HitimishoUlinganisho wa kihistoria na kimaandiko unaonyesha wazi kwamba Ukristo ni bora kuliko Uislamu. Biblia ina ushahidi wa kihistoria, upendo wa Mungu, unabii ulio timilika, na uhakika wa wokovu. Uislamu una misingi dhaifu ya kihistoria, unakanusha ukweli wa kifo cha Yesu na hutegemea matendo bila neema. Qur’an yenyewe inasema:“Neno la Mungu haliwezi kubadilishwa”(Qur’an 10:64). Kwa hivyo, Biblia inabaki kuwa Neno la Mungu lisiloharibika, na Ukristo unathibitisha ukuu wake juu ya Uislamu.Maelezo ya ChiniMarejeoBiblia TakatifuQur’an Tukufu (tafsiri ya Yusuf Ali na Pickthall)Vitabu vya kihistoria vilivyotajwa hapo juuJe ungependa nifanyemuundo wa kitabu (chapters + subchapters)ili makala hii iwe sehemu ya kitabu kipya chako cha apologetics, au iendelee kubaki kama makala ya kitaaluma ya kujitegemea?FootnotesPhilip Jenkins,The Lost History of Christianity(HarperOne, 2008), uk. 34.↩Flavius Josephus,Antiquities of the Jews, 18.3.3; Tacitus,Annals, 15.44.↩Geza Vermes,The Complete Dead Sea Scrolls in English(Penguin, 2011).↩Gary Habermas & Michael Licona,The Case for the Resurrection of Jesus(Kregel, 2004).↩Hastings Rashdall,The Universities of Europe in the Middle Ages(Oxford, 1895).↩Thomas F.
